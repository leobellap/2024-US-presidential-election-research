"I'm a Catholic, and my priest gave us the annual election schpiel at the end of last Sunday's mass about how this election is about voting for the lesser of two evils. He didn't come out and say vote for Trump, but he did say that only one candidate is for protecting the right of the unborn and to keep that in mind when we we're filling out our ballot. With that being said, I guess my choice is easy. I have to ""vote for the lesser of two evils,"". This is why I will be voting for Kamala Harris on election day. 

There needs to be a separation of church and state in this country. I don't want the government to get involved in my faith, and my faith should not try to get involved in government business. On a faithful level, I don't agree with abortion. At the same time, I do feel women should have autonomy over their own bodies. Women should be allowed to get pregnant without the fear of dying during pregnancy just because they can't get the proper health care. Or if they are raped they should have the opportunity to seek an abortion. Who am I to say you can't do this or that with your body just because it goes against my faith. 

A lot of Catholics and Christians demonize women who get abortions. They think they are monsters who get an abortion just on a whim. When in reality, that's no the case. It's a deep personal and emotional decision. If it's truly wrong in God's eyes, then he will be the judge in the end, but we as Catholics should not try to regulate what someone does with their body. At the same time, Trump is the complete opposite of what the Bible teaches, and I wish more Catholics and Christians would realize this.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

"Conservatives getting mad at telling women their vote is secret, while not directly saying they're fine with women not voting with their husbands, reminds me of how the internal misogyny of the GOP can be best summarized with what happened with Steven Crowder.

And he did this while also forbidding her from borrowing the car and doing nothing but sit on the patio smoking a cigar.

When he addressed it on his show, one of the first things he lamented was how the state allowed no-fault divorce, and said it shouldn't. His instinctual response to his wife leaving him was to wish she legally wasn't allowed to without his approval.

>More impressive than the rate of growth is its quality. This growth didn‚Äôt come solely from using up finite supplies of labor and other resources, which could fuel inflation. Instead, it came from making people and businesses more productive.

>This combination, if sustained, will be a wind at the back of the next president. **Three of the past four newcomers to the White House took office in or around a recession (the exception was¬†Donald Trump, in 2017**), which consumed much of their first-term agenda. The next president should be free of that burden.¬†

"For those who need to hear it, Marc Elias, who has literally helped win major cases in the past few weeks to stop GOP suppression (Georgia being a big one) and interference efforts, [talks at length about how much Donald Trump's ""little secret"" is a joke.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWhjrQCpn0Y) How we already know what the plan is, and how severely limited their path to do it will be.

Get out and vote. We need to get the totals as high as possible to win in the swing house districts and swing states. That's what matters. Don't waste your time and energy worrying about Trump's bravado. Help us vote to win.

**Edit:** For those who worry about the SCOTUS, it's not addressed here, but there are major limits to what they can do as long as we turn out as highly as possible. The GOP do not control the crucial blue wall states at all, and if we see wins similar to 2020 (or slightly more narrow), there's really no path to overturning that. 2000 happened because the total was under 1000 and a republican governor (his own damn brother) tipped the scales in Bush's favor, [having already disqualified a large number of votes beforehand. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/11/13/florida-black-ballots-affected-most-in-2000/16784e7d-439a-4b96-9653-1b7362312d2a/)We know exactly what caused the problem and several of those vulnerabilities were addressed since then. That's not going to happen in PA/MI/WI/GA/AZ, and it's still unlikely in NC/NV. Election integrity there should be very safe, and Georgia is also having 'very' strong turnout and has blocked all of Trump's attempts to mess with the results. Once the votes are counted, and they will be counted quickly, the SCOTUS has few to no paths to stop anything.

"Trump didn't really expect to win 2016. He really looked like the most shocked person that night, even amongst a moment when most of the world was stunned. His plan at the time was pretty clear (and not a terrible one). He would claim fraud, spend the next four years milking in money, ranting against Hilary and getting on TV at every possible moment to attack her, and have raking it in run against a weaker version of her in 2020 and win. It's why he looked cocky and had a swagger that entire race - win or lose the race he was going to win in the end. 

2020 he didn't just expect to win, he demanded it. Of his team, of the courts, of the voters. Once he was in power he did not plan to give it up. It's why his entire act that year again was authoritative style dominance and confidence. 

He clearly doesn't think he'll win this year. He's been increasingly masking himself in burnt orange tanner, his body language slumped, his mental state deteriorating live on TV. But he also knows he needs to win because of the sheer amount of legal cases waiting for him if he loses. So he's been carrying an especially unusual odor over the last few weeks - *desperation*.

‚Ä¶ Police say the man who firebombed ballot boxes in¬†**WA and OR**¬†has experience in metalworking and will likely be back to try again.

‚Ä¶¬†**Donald Trump**¬†held his rally in NM today on an airport tarmac. He wanted to hold it at the¬†**Albuquerque Convention Center**, but the city told him that he had to pay his $445,000 bill that has been due since 2019 first. He refused, so Deadbeat Donnie‚Äôs cult is on a tarmac.

‚Ä¶¬†**Tucker Carlson**¬†did a podcast interview with a christian YouTube channel and recounted a story where he claimed he was physically mauled last year in the middle of the night by a ‚Äúspiritual demon‚Äù and he woke up with bloody claw marks all over his ribs and shoulder. Are we still not allowed to call them weird? I know they get sensitive about these things.

‚Ä¶¬†**Alex Jones**¬†posted on Twitter that Carlson told him this story over a year ago in confidence, and Jones says that this same phenomenon is happening to many other prominent people. This is MAGA.

‚Ä¶¬†**Lebron James**¬†posted a video to his 159 million IG and 59 million Twitter followers that he is supporting Kamala Harris, which included clips from Trump‚Äôs racist MSG rally. Lebron: ‚ÄúWhen I think about my kids and my family and how they will grow up, the choice is clear to me. VOTE KAMALA HARRIS!!!‚Äù

‚Ä¶¬†**Charlie Kirk**¬†responded that James will ‚Äúnever be as good as¬†**Michael Jordan**,‚Äù and says his ad was misleading and used Trump clips out of context.

‚Ä¶ Former NYC Mayor¬†**Mike Bloomberg**¬†endorsed¬†**Kamala Harris**¬†today, saying ‚Äúshe is determined to lead our nation forward, and she understands that the only way to do that is by bringing people back together. I‚Äôm ready, and I think most Americans are.‚Äù

‚Ä¶ Kamala Harris picked up endorsements from 3 key Republicans in¬†**NH**¬†who supported¬†**Nikki Haley**¬†in the primary. Former US Senator¬†**Gordon Humphrey**, former congressman¬†**Chuck Douglas**, and former AG¬†**Thomas Rath**¬†all endorsed a Democrat for president for the first time in their lives.

‚Ä¶ Humphrey: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dangerous to our democracy.‚Äù

‚Ä¶ Douglas: ‚ÄúHe believes in himself over service‚Äù and has a ‚Äúfragile mental state.‚Äù

‚Ä¶ Rath: Campaign is one of ‚Äúdivision, anger, thinly veiled prejudice, and rejection of our core values as a nation.‚Äù

‚Ä¶¬†**Joe Rogan**¬†pressed Vance on ‚Äúreligious men‚Äù dictating to women what they can and can‚Äôt do with their bodies after¬†**Roe**¬†was overturned. Vance said ‚Äúwomen are going way too far‚Äù exaggerating the problem and just want to ‚Äúcelebrate‚Äù having abortions.

‚Ä¶ Vance claimed that when he heard about the shooting at the Trump rally in PA he went home, loaded all his guns, and stood sentry inside his front door thinking that they might be coming for him next. Sounds legit.

‚Ä¶ Trump sued¬†**CBS**¬†for $10 Billion dollars because¬†**60 Minutes**¬†edited Harris‚Äôs interview like they do all interviews. Harris responded: ‚ÄúTrump is focused on his enemies list while I‚Äôm focused on my To-Do List.‚Äù

‚Ä¶ He filed the lawsuit in the¬†**Amarillo Division**¬†of the¬†**Northern District of Texas**, where Elon Musk also filed his most recent lawsuits against media companies. That is the District run by former Trump donor¬†**Matthew Kascmaryck**, which is becoming MAGA home court for litigation to be forum shopped to.

‚Ä¶ Trump then followed that up at his rally tonight by saying that¬†**ABC**¬†should also lose their broadcast license in addition to CBS. Elon Musk said a couple days ago that all networks should lose their licenses and be put up for public auction. But don‚Äôt call them fascists.

‚Ä¶ The fallout continues from Trump surrogate¬†**Charlie Kirk**‚Äôs appearance on¬†**Megyn Kelly**‚Äôs podcast where he said that Republican wives should vote the way their husbands do.""

"Think back as far as you can, if you're a Democrat. How do you feel enthusiasm is for Harris compared to:

Biden

Clinton

Obama (Possibly the only one with MORE enthusiasm IMO)

Kerry

Gore  
  
I point this out for all the doomers. Looking at the candidates in a list like this, you see why Harris is different. Clinton was in a no-win because nobody was going to follow Obama and live up to those shoes. Plus Trump's enthusiasm among uncommitted and never-Hillary people peaked. 

I know Trump got more votes in 2020, but it was more polarized. MAGA was more whooped up and the uncommitted were more on the fence, thus then, Biden. 

Now what? MAGA is only getting smaller. A lot of the ""hold-nose-vote-Trump"" people can't do it again. And now Harris' enthusiasm among uncommitted and never-Trump people is peaking.  

THIS IS NOT COMPLACENCY, MERELY SOME BLOOM FOR TODAY. YOU MUST VOTE, YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY MUST VOTE. VOTE LIKE YOUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

> While millions will still vote for the Republican candidate, perhaps hating immigrants more than they love reproductive rights, the only certainty at this point is that many millions more will vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.

> In the latest ABC News/Ipsos national poll, the Democrat enjoyed a 14% advantage with women over Trump; among women with a college degree, that number rose to 23%; among women voters under 40, it rocketed to 34%. According to the Brookings Institution, Harris&#039; strength among women angered by the 2022 Dobbs decision could explain why Democrats, for the first time in forever, are polling better with older voters than Republicans.

> Speaking with former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, Kirk seemed genuinely upset that women could be voting for Harris in massive numbers - and lying to their controlling husbands about it.

**And they are surprised that women are lining up in droves to vote against them after they proudly and** ***bombastically congratulated themselves for actually ending this FIFTY YEAR RULING***?

***I*** voted the INSTANT I was able to, and I live in *Vermont*, where this state now has the absolute ***best*** abortion-access available at the shielded-state level in the entire nation. We get our ballots mailed out automatically based on registration address and so when I got my ballot about a week and a half ago, it was filled out and dropped on in person the very next day.

We ain't fucking around. Vermont is going to give Harris her largest % margin of victory nationwide *just like we did with Biden.*

Oh yeah, even though I **never** vote Republican (I go Sanders, Becca Balint, etc. each time), it **was in fact** our Republican Governor who actually championed shielding abortion access at the state level **immediately** once roe fell. He even said, specifically, that not doing so would actually be the wrong, immoral thing to do.

This same Republican Governor stayed up night after night after night during Covid when Trump's admin dragged its ass on stimulus checks and he was signing out treasury checks (that were given the ok) to each and every Vermonter who hadn't gotten their much needed emergency funds. This was our REPUBLICAN Governor doing this.

The gist of the article, I gathered, is that misogynists Charlie Kirk and Jesse Watters are talking about wives who vote Harris but tell their husbands they're voting Trump. This isn't exactly what happens in the Julia Roberts ad they're referencing but it's close.

Anyway, they're overblowing their anger. Funny, by the way. They're so *offended*. But to their point -- I do wonder about the marriage if you have to lie about that. Doesn't seem like a true life partner. But that's my personal pondering.

"> the American family

One of the oldest, biggest, and most pervasive myths of American life is the concept of a defined family structure that must be defended to the death or society will crumble.

Nobody on the right ever clarifies what ""the American family"" consists of, because they don't need to -- it's been drilled into their heads from the moment they're old enough to talk. It's the ""American family"" that was immortalized in all those black-and-white 1950s sitcoms we all remember, with exact parameters:

- white
- Christian
- hetero
- husband with manly career and manly hobbies that prove physical strength and patriotic heroism
- housewife who does womanly things like maintaining the home and rearing the children and knitting and cooking and wearing frilly aprons and doing whatever the husband says
- multiple children who play football (male) or whatever their mothers do (female)

This default setting is what they mean when they screech about threats to ""the American family"", because literally anything can upset this specific programming. Wife wants a career or otherwise thinks for herself? BZZT. One of the kids is gay? BZZT. Multi-racial? Clashing cultures, inviting strife. BZZT. Husband battling depression? BZZZZZZZZZZZZT

The thing is, this mythical family is not, and never has been, the ""norm"". It is something you might find in a pop-up picture book, but denies what has been the reality for 230 years: The ""American family"" is whatever any family is, including all quirks and faults and weirdness and complexity you might find, and the far right are driving themselves squirrelbonkers trying to defend something that never existed in the first place.",2024_11_01,05_55_02
"He's saying those things to stigmatize it. Not that I don't think he believes it, but the main reason these people say stuff like this is to make women uncomfortable with the idea.

"He also said something about the poor husbands being lied to who work so hard to provide her entire life.

As if no women have jobs.

I think it's ""interesting"" to think about how these men so badly want women out of the workforce and in the home, yet they go on about how men providing financially is such a big sacrifice and he's doing it for her. Um. 

It's like when men say they'll ""protect"" women. They mean control. He gets to have all the power and money in the relationship, AND have her feel grateful to him for it. They like to providers because it allows them to say ""look at all I've done for you, look at all I've given to you. You owe me."" How dare you not vote for the candidate I say you will.

If being the spouse at home was truly that much easier, and being the spouse who works was truly that sacrificing, you'd see the roles reverse. Men would take housework for themselves and force women into the job market, but that's not happening for a reason.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

"This goes back to really early liberal theory. The idea is that a person needs to be independent to have the franchise, otherwise the dependent person will be another vote for the person they are dependent upon. If Person A owns a factory employing 100 people, Person A can coerce those 100 employees, by threatening their pay or employment, or offering them extra benefits, and thus gain undue influence over the affairs of the state. 

This is the reason that liberal political theory in the 18th century required some sort of property or income requirement for the franchise. This wasn't just about affecting women or poor people either. While many if not most yeoman farmers closer to the coast were producing for market, some were still subsistence farmers, and moreso as you got towards the interior. The subsistence yeoman farmer would have the franchise while the adult son of a skilled craftsman might not because he hadn't yet inherited his father's shop. 

It was also justified by the concept of virtual representation. The material interests of the son are significantly similar to that of the father, that the father can act as a re-presenation of the son. Same concept for the women in the family. 

This theory began to die out in the early republican era when the sons of franchised men would lose the franchise, especially because the partitioning of land among sons reduced the property each son owned. 

These concerns haven't entirely gone away (as it is the topic of this very post wherein the MAGA man assumes he has control over the vote of his wife), but the secret ballot has mostly alleviated the concern. The secret ballot wouldn't be introduced as core element of liberalism until the mid-19th century.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

I spent a good majority of my life in the church, not by force or because that's what my family wanted, but because I choose that. I made the affirmative decision to get baptized as an adult(that's how much of a choice it was in my family).

"I mean that's cool; are you sure you didn't respond to the right comment? I read it like ya did anyway. :P

I mean I grew up in the church too, sort of. Southern Baptist no less. We left when I was a young'un. My parents remained Christians though. And loving people. Even after their transgender daughter came out to them as a fully functional, self-supporting adult (I mean came out as transgender; not as an adult :P).

I live in a city where half your Poke Stops are churches (I don't know if that means anything to you, but yeah :P). They're everywhere. I walk by two walking the dog. If I hadn't already voted, I could vote Tuesday at one of them.

I never really called myself a Christian. But when I spat ""God is dead"" at my Southern Baptist AP English teacher, she rolled her eyes and asked me if I'd actually finished Zarathustra. Maybe my formative years were a bit unordinary. I dunno.

I was ashamed of calling myself a Christian, at one point in my post-Christian life. But that was a long time ago. And that's because I've grown up alongside, worked beside, lived around those Christians my whole life since. And I've realized that so many of them, regardless of what they believe, are not BAD people. Plenty have those blue Harris/Walz signs in their yards, and plenty would go to the mat for me, even knowing who I truly am.

Just like I've worked alongside those who pray five times a day, and then get up and help improve the roads that carry us all around this religious town, even if we only have the one mosque. Or alongside those that won't indulge in Taco Night for religious reasons, but will certainly come along to the bar and enjoy themselves and know that no one they're with gives two fucks about their refusal to partake in those amazing tacos.

Christians get a bad rap. For a lot of good reasons. Religion gets a bad rap. For a LOT of good reasons. But religion also helps a lot of really good, really decent people make it through the day, gives them a compass in life. And that matters. Because I know how hard it is to get through a day without that conjured compass. I've lived it, for a very long time. I would be a monster to look at those people and mock them their decency, their moral compass, because I, personally - in my infinite, superior intellect - think their compass was broken.

There's plenty of bad that can be traced directly to religious fervor. You don't even have to look far back. I'm not talking Crusades, Witch Trials, Partition, Inquisition, any of that. Just spin your globe, right now, and pick a spot. But there is certainly plenty of good that can be traced to religious adherence too. To adherence to those messages of love and camaraderie and decency and morality that our real-deal ""Good Christians"" choose to cherry-pick, as opposed to the verses that evangelical crowd prefers.

I will never disregard those people again. Never be ashamed of them. Regardless of their beliefs, they're good people. And they *are* out there. And goddamnit, they are more numerous than the vicious trolls that rally behind the self-centered monsters that drape themselves in religious fervor. They are. They have to be. If they were not, we would not exist as a species currently. We would have killed each other so long ago.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

He announced, quite infamously: ""I'm gonna take my talents to South Beach,"" meaning he signed with the Miami Heat, and would not be staying in Cleveland.

This was not received well by the Cavs organization or its fans, for obvious reasons. Fans burned his jerseys, and the Cavs owner guaranteed the Cavs would win a title before LeBron did.

After a 4 year stint in Miami, where he won 2 championships, LeBron returned to Cleveland in free agency. He would go on to win a championship there in 2016, the first major sports title for the city in roughly 52 years, and the first for the Cavaliers in franchise history.

"It was very apparent during the Rogan interview, that he is losing it. He rambled on for 3 hours and barely answered any of the questions. He‚Äôs just an old man who likes when people listen to his stories. He‚Äôs an entertainer, deeply narcissistic, and it really doesn‚Äôt go much deeper than that. The fact that people have gone along with his little show and actually voted for him would be hilarious if it wasn‚Äôt so dangerous. He is not a good businessman or a good politician, is morally corrupt, and is just someone who is having his ego fed with rallies. He should have stayed on with the apprentice instead of running in 2015. It would have saved him and his family, and our country, a lot of stress and strife.

"I listened to a couple of clips of the interview but far from the full 3 hours. The thing about Trump is that the general content hasn't really changed (though it does veer more extreme now.) But he used to have this zing, this sharpness and fire, which is pretty much how he conned his way to victory in the first place. If you were not a super educated person, it was enough to easily believe that ""it actually kind of makes sense though"" and ""he must know what he's talking about"" etc. With his much lower energy level now, it lays bare how little he actually had to say in the first place. If he didn't already have all this momentum and support already, he could NEVER break into politics now the way he did in 2016.

This is really good actually, because (according to a podcast I listen to) Trump's campaign is actually following a high-risk high-reward strategy this time around. He's trying to pick up a bunch of young, male, usual-non-voters because he does so badly mainstream. They're the kind who usually wouldn't vote for anyone. But his low energy and relative lack of charisma makes me strongly feel that he won't be able to drum up nearly the level of enthusiasm he did last time. 

He last won an election in 2016, and even that was a fluke. And it was a long time ago.

The way MAGA can't ever admit that, just perhaps, Trump is *too old*, is mind-boggling. It's like they've never met anyone in their lives 75+. 

My grandfather was the same at 92 as he was at 72. Six months before his 94th birthday, he was confused, incredibly paranoid, unable to remember basic things, and had lost 60 lbs. He died shortly after turning 94. Age-related degenerative diseases/decline can happen ***FAST***. And the chance of it happening, logically, increases the older you get.

Trump is obsessed with superficial appearances and people looking like they came out of ""central casting,"" so he probably thinks glasses would make him look old or less ""tough"" or like a nerd or something.

Harris is getting some of that too, where she is being held to a near impossible standard of perfection and clairity, but in her case she luckily does not have 20 years of concentrated propaganda convincing everyone that Hillary is something she is not.

Hell, even when I mention this in left-leaning places, left wing people will come storming in to tell me that everything is Hillary's fault and how she is really the worst person in the world.

Hillary's biggest fault is that she is boring on TV. She is bog-standard liberal. Intelligent, competent, and sort of charismatically flat. So in short she makes a great elected official and lawyer, and a poor TV star.

As an aside, by ""activists"", I mean the pejorative way used by the right. I volunteer at a homeless shelter & a food bank with a good friend of mine who's a transgender woman and we're ""activists"" for affordable housing and helping homeless people off the streets. I have friends who are a lesbian couple that are ""activists"" who volunteer with after school programs for inner-city elementary school kids doing science activities, art, games, and sports. I'm friends with a gay guy the next state over who escorts women to Planned Parenthood (bc abortion is illegal in my state). My dog's trainer is nonbinary and they volunteer in the evening 4 days a week at their local animal shelter.

I'm not going to try to say he's definitively gay or trans or anything, but I really do think that deep down there are some kind of Urges in there that don't fit proper Heritage Foundation views, we'll say, and he thinks the only way to truly be happy is to suppress them and conform as much as possible. 

It always makes me sad to see people who seem so clearly to be repressing their desires that way, even as I'm angry at their actions to *suppress* everyone else.

"> Who knows what he‚Äôs been spending campaign money on this season 

This story confirms a report from 2016 that did not receive much attention at the time. Bob Guccioni was publisher of the magazine, _Penthouse_. The news story said that, after he died, someone was going through a trailer full of his personal papers and photos, and there was a separate box of color 35mm slides of Trump groping the breasts of about 25 of the women who had appeared as centerfolds or as nude models in the magazine, over a period of 10 or 15 years.

The person who had found the box put the slides up for sale on EBay, and the Trump campaign immediately exercised the ""Buy it Now"" option and bought every slide, for $25,000/slide.

Anyway, that's the way I remember the story, except that the box also contained notes on how much he paid them if they complained. This was while he was on ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" so this was proof in photos of his comments on the ET tape.

---

If this was a movie script, of course the corrupt politician would have paid Russian mobsters to kill Epstein in his cell, and they would have paid the jail guards to turn off the ""suicide watch"" videotape, and look the other way as they did the murder.

And of course, if this was a movie, the attorney general would have been involved, and also Russian spies.

It says something about the way TV and movies have warped my perceptions, that this seems to me to be a much more likely true account of Epstein's death, than any that was presented by the authorities, at the time.

The official account has a very Russian FSB feel to it. 

 - Epstein broke his neck when he tied a short piece of a sheet around his neck, tied the other end to the top bunk in his cell, and fell about 2 feet, jerking the improvised rope tight.

That sounds impossible on the face of it. Suffocation, I might believe, but a broken neck? No way.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

Because they could just as easily choose to take lives, enrich themselves further, steal resources from the poor, and so on, like so many *other* billionaires have chosen to do.

It's even worse, since billionaires aren't picked for their knowledge, wisdom, empathy, or ability to solve complex long-term problems.

Seriously though, the incellification of conservative masculinity is probably the most pathetic (yet dangerous) trend that I have seen over the past ten years.

It all started when Steve Bannon took GamerGate and transformed it into a political movement based on misogyny and homophobia.  He continued to expand it with the help of Roger Some and Ron Watkins to convince that group that there was a conspiracy against them specifically. 

That evolved into Q-Anon, pulling more people into its circle, and has graduated into the current iteration of MAGA.  Still convinced that there are conspiracies keeping them down, that nothing is their fault, and selling revenge against ""The Other"" for unnamed grievances.

Worst of all, many of them feel that they have nothing to lose and are suffering from clear mental health challenges which are being inflamed by Trump and his cronies.  Not at all dissimilar to how terrorist leaders will groom disaffected young men to strap bombs to themselves.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

That word ""totem"" was taken by settlers and applied to the traditional carvings of west coast nations like the Haida and Kwakwaka'wakw. So it's a bit like applying French words to describe Russian culture. Most coastal people I know don't like the term ""totem pole"" for this reason, especially the ones who don't even have clan governance üòÖ

Coastal poles do not depict a hierarchy. They tell stories.

"I know some women want to ban abortion totally. But for those of us who are pro choice, it's about even more than abortion rights. Because my body as a woman is less my own than a man's body is his.

If the principle is that the state can exert control over a body in order to preserve life, then I have less issue with that -- as long as it applies to all people and not just women.

 So a woman can be forced to give up rights to her body for nine months. I've had two children. It means that when I'm sick, I can't have drugs to ease the discomfort because of the fetus. I can't have alcohol or caffeine. I can't have some of my regular medications that were prescribed for very valid reasons. I was very nauseous with both pregnancies, one of them 24 hours a day for three months. Pregnancy WILL damage your body, and not just in cosmetic ways. I dealt with back pain that no one could fix for 20 years because of childbirth. Many women are rendered incontinent. 

Further, childbirth carries a risk of death. And if something goes wrong, some of these new bans kill the women. And all this for a fetus that not everyone agrees is actually a person.

On the other hand, if one of our kids -- post-birth, with a Social Security number and everything -- had needed a blood transfusion, and the only match was my husband, no one could force him to give them blood. (He would choose to, of course, but no one could force him to.) And blood donation is NOTHING. It barely hurts, there's basically no risk, it takes half an hour, zero long-term effects. 

And isn't a life a life? So it shouldn't just apply to our own children. If the state can override bodily autonomy to save lives, then shouldn't we all be required to donate blood every 8 weeks? That saves lives. Shouldn't we all be on the marrow registry and be required to donate if matched? That's still easier than pregnancy and childbirth. So is kidney donation. 

Thanks to modern medicine, there are many ways a man's body could be coopted by the state to save lives. But it doesn't happen. 

Even in death, when there are no possible negative health effects, we can refuse to donate life-saving organs and tissue. In Texas, a dead man has more bodily autonomy than a live woman.

And that tells me what I am to my nation. Not quite a real person, with all the rights a real person has. And whether they explain it this way or not, that's why the pro choice women are so pissed off.

> What Bannon found was a world ‚Äúpopulated by millions of intense young men‚Äù who may have been socially maladroit, but were ‚Äúsmart, focused, relatively wealthy, and highly motivated about issues that mattered to them.‚Äù While these were the same players who destroyed IGE‚Äôs business model, Bannon saw something he could use. ‚ÄúThese guys,‚Äù said Bannon, ‚Äúthese rootless, white males, had monster power. It was the pre-Reddit.‚Äù

That toxic gaming space.... the fragile men my friends and I used to call the B-Net Babies back in our D2 days and later the Barrens Chat kids (regardless of if we were in the Barrens Chat or not, we called all the most toxic assholes that). Steve Bannon looked at that and saw the future.

The direct path from the assholes on D2 to the assholes on WoW to gamergate to MAGA is scary. Gamergate was definitely a trial run for a lot of stuff.",2024_11_01,05_55_02
"Real easy to get sucked into that shit.  With some of the overly loud voices saying some pretty stupid things on one side the anti sjw movement really gained steam off the back of it and it was all downhill from there.  I remember finding myself agreeing with a few videos from the likes of Bearing until I realised he was just an angry prick getting upset at fringe voices who were FINALLY being heard, even if some of the things they were saying were a bit outside the norm.  

When I stepped back and examined the reasons why some of these people expressed themselves the way they did, you realise being marginalised and shut up your whole life might mean you sometimes get a bit carried away in how you express yourself.  The difference is, their shit is not based on hate, whereas the anti-sjw shit is.  

It's a disingenuous way of targeting social progress based on a few loud voices and frankly I would rather understand why a marginalised person might be a bit upset than hearing another white dude ranting about why we shouldn't listen to it.",2024_11_01,05_55_02
"I was a full-blown Nazi for a long time. 4chan radicalized me when I was 15-16 or so. I'd say all kinds of transphobic shit in class, which I don't want to repeat. I bullied the hell out of a poor trans girl.

When GamerGate happened, I of course was into it. I was super active here on Reddit. But there was a split at some point between the KiA parts of Reddit and the anti-GamerGate parts of Reddit - and somehow I stayed part of both.

Someone made a comment that opened my eyes about how dangerous and stupid the whole GamerGate movement was. I forget exactly what the comment was, but it made me realize ""Maybe this whole GamerGate thing is overblown"" and I unsubbed from KiA and the other GamerGate subs.

That was the beginning of my de-radicalization. Another contributing factor - stupid as it is  - was the 4chan sub spoiling the ending of The Force Awakens before I had a chance to see it, which pissed me off enough to unsub from all 4chan-adjacent stuff. I also got a stable job for the first time and generally started to realize I was toxic and needed to stop being such an incel.

Teams have leaders, and the leader is in charge. You can challenge the leader, and if you succeed you were correcting the order. The family is the fundamental model of the way the world functions, and the father is the undisputed leader of the family.

He says: ""... we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at."" 

The detractors want you to believe the subject of that sentence is ""those weapons of war that I carried in war.""  

But with that interpretation, look at what the sentence becomes. It would have him saying, ""we can make sure that those weapons ... is the only place those weapons are at."" 

Actually they're hoping you'll focus on the words ""in war"" and not notice that in order to find some ""stolen valor"" to smear Walz with they're parsing the sentence in a way that turns it into gibberish. 

The subject is ""those weapons of war."" What is he saying about them? He says we can sure that ""in war is the only place those weapons are at."" 

Now it's not gibberish, it's just awkwardly phrased. He's saying that war is the only place weapons of war (that he carried) should only be found.

The campaign said he misspoke -- and mangling a sentence that badly certainly is that -- and they moved on. But don't pretend that his point wasn't clear, a point that he made at other venues without the mangled syntax.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

I believe our Constitution will outlast any person.  The federal courts have ruled against Trump in every one of his election lawsuits.  SCOTUS has refused to hear cases that Trump and Republicans wanted heard.  While the Supreme Court may be too conservative and not what I would like in terms of balance, they are not in the bag on every Trump issue.

> He's going to be operating completely free of guardrails this time with the immunity ruling

That ruling was much narrower than what you are stating, and I think you are smart enough to know that even if others fall for the rhetoric.  The constitutional way to deal with a president is through impeachment, that is still a valid option.  The problem comes when you have zero credibility and start demanding impeachment before a president even takes office.

> But your words on here do have the ability to influence other people's opinions.

Isn‚Äôt that what public speech is all about?

These posts are far more measured than the rhetoric being flung around on the campaign trail.  If Harris loses because she and the Democrats screwed up the election then she deserves to lose.  It is as simple as that.

Then its wayfair, they basically pretend to be a furniture store but they actually sell children, its why they have those actual names for children and the dimensions and doors are actually the age of the children you can order. The elite democrats have been using it for years.

Also Democrats have a secret weather hurricane machine they use to target republican states, they have total control of the weather.

"> Four years ago, Donald Trump insisted that voting fraud cost him the election, and he hired Ken Block to prove it.
> 
> A data analyst, Block did his best, searching for dead voters, double-voting and absentee ballot fraud. But he found only about a dozen examples of fraud in Georgia ‚Äî far short of the 11,780 votes Trump needed to overturn Democrat Joe Biden‚Äôs victory.
> 
> ‚ÄúWe have all these unfounded claims of voter fraud,‚Äù Block told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ‚ÄúThere are so many that it‚Äôs hard to believe it‚Äôs not true. But the reality is, it‚Äôs not true.‚Äù
> 
> Block took an interest in elections after running twice for Rhode Island governor. He lost both times but gained expertise studying voter registration and other election data.
> 
> That‚Äôs why the Trump campaign called him the day after the 2020 election and asked him to review fraud allegations in Georgia and five other swing states Biden won.
> 
> Block took the job. In the weeks that followed he did his own research and reviewed the work of other analysts. But he found himself debunking ‚Äî not proving ‚Äî fraud allegations.
> 
> One example: Block reviewed a Trump campaign analysis that claimed thousands of people had illegally voted twice ‚Äî once in Georgia and again in another state.
> 
> ‚ÄúEvery single claim they asked me to look at was false,‚Äù he said.
> 
> Block said the Trump campaign lawyers he worked with accepted his analysis. 
> 
> But four years after the election, Block said many people still believe it was stolen ‚Äúbecause President Trump continues to bang the drum‚Äù of voting fraud and conservative media outlets continue to echo his complaints.
> 
> ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt provide their listeners any contrary information to that narrative,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried to tell my story in conservative media, and nobody will have me.‚Äù
> 
> Block said the reason Trump lost is more mundane than voting fraud.
> 
> Many moderate Republicans who voted for him in 2016 didn‚Äôt vote for him four years later. Between 2016 and 2020, Trump lost more than enough support in the deepest red counties in Georgia and other swing states to account for Biden‚Äôs margin of victory, Block said.

The good news for this election, at least in Georgia, is that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger pledged Wednesday to uphold the results of the presidential election no matter who wins, and attorneys for the state are prepared to fight¬†potential lawsuits¬†by a losing candidate.

"Ken Block‚Äôs book ‚ÄúDisproven‚Äù is excellent. It goes state by state and in depth about why there isn‚Äôt evidence of fraud. He takes the major claims and explains why they are flawed all while showcasing how the Trump campaign understood this and continued to say there was fraud. 

He also shows how there *are* real vulnerabilities in the way we manage our elections. Most notably that they are run so drastically different state to state that it could be impossible to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù some instances of fraud. That said, it‚Äôs also impossible to commit fraud at anything other than a small scale. And this who do that are facing major federal crimes.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

Trump won Kansas 56-41‚Ä¶15 points.  That‚Äôs over a 30 point swing. 

Sure a lot of republicans will vote in favor of abortion but still vote Trump in places like AZ, NV, FL, MO, MD, NY, SD, NE, CO & MT, but I feel like this is the issue that will tip the election back in democrats favor by at least 3-5 points in each of these states.

So if you're his internal pollster and want to get paid, you fudge it to show him what he wants. For a while, until even that isn't enough for him. At which point you move on and someone willing to go further steps in.

And then he thinks NY/NJ/CA are *really* in play, demands campaign events there. And that's just the obvious example. You also find that all Trump's ideas focus-group really well (if you even bother to check) when in the real world ""men in womens' sports"" isn't at the top of the list of concerns for anyone who isn't already voting for you.

I suspect that as a result of his ""fake news"" views and the sea of yes-men, he is wasting far more money than any previous candidate. The fact that he still might win is depressing, but I tell myself that he may be acting differently enough from past candidates (including himself in prior elections) that even ""real"" polls are overestimating him.",2024_11_01,05_55_02
Something that kept coming up in 2020 is that he was told if he got 65m votes or more he would win easily and of course his stupid brain can‚Äôt course correct to reality.¬†,2024_11_01,05_55_02

"It's really the core of what's most telling about this entire saga: 

The Trump internal comms and political structure ever more closely resembles the Russian concept of ""vranyo"", a culture which arose during the Soviet era and defined by Wiktionary as

> Half-lies in Russian culture, told without the intention of (maliciously) deceiving, but as a fantasy, suppressing unpleasant parts of the truth.

The critical fact here being that lies are accepted as long as they reinforce what's pleasant to hear, not what's true. 

It's ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" in essence. Everybody knows he's naked, but compliments the clothes. 

Wonder where he got that from...

"Good post. The power of positive thinking.

Fred Trump took the family to Dr Peale's church in New York and he imbibed that stuff like mother's milk. 

I read his (Peale's) book, it's great motivational imagery, for a salesperson especially. One has to visualize success and internalize it, not letting any negativity to bring you down. Salespeople face rejection time and again, they need this kind of emotional help, especially when just starting out. It's all imagination, of course.

The effect is not unlike a placebo, that is the power of the mind. Trump is bending reality to fit his desired outcome (like how he brags about crowd sizes even when everyone can tell he's full of shit). His insiders know they have to maintain these illusions, so they never contradict him. This would be super bad in government, which is why he had so much trouble with his chiefs of staff.

For a hyper-narcissist it must be like a drug. We can see he surrounds himself with yes-men, and to keep negative reality from bubbling up he has everyone around him sign NDAs. He refuses to admit he was wrong ... like *ever*. He refuses to change his mind once publicly committed, because to him it is like admitting to a mistake. He can't have that. 

So when he started to call Covid a hoax and downplay the dangers he had a very hard time dealing with the reality of hundreds of thousands of people dying. His faithful followers helped him maintain the illusion and stood by him by also denying the dangers of Covid in a very public way and as we have seen they eventually began dropping like flies. 

They proved their loyalty by dying for him and deep down he knows that. That's a powerful narcissistic supply.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

In Oct 2024 about 88% of the state was registered to vote, adding around 1.7M registrations, so total of 18.6M registered. It is not perfect by any means but the trend is looking good! And this is in a state that does not make it easy for everyone to vote and even reduced hours this year and limited poll locations and ballot drop boxes, along with making it illegal to give food or water to those in line. (Side note - this made me sad because our local polling place always had volunteers showing up like it‚Äôs a cookout, with lots of food and potluck dishes.

"Here's a link to their full endorsement article: [A second Trump term comes with unacceptable risks](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/10/31/a-second-trump-term-comes-with-unacceptable-risks)

> By making Mr Trump leader of the free world, Americans would be gambling with the economy, the rule of law and international peace. We cannot quantify the chance that something will go badly wrong: nobody can. But we believe voters who minimise it are deluding themselves.

> The case against Mr Trump begins with his policies. In 2016 the Republican platform was still caught between the Mitt Romney party and the Trump party. Today‚Äôs version is more extreme. Mr Trump favours a 20% tariff on all imports and has talked of charging over 200% or even 500% on cars from Mexico. He proposes to deport millions of irregular immigrants, many with jobs and American children. He would extend tax cuts even though the budget deficit is at a level usually seen only during war or recession, suggesting a blithe indifference to sound fiscal management.

> The risks for domestic and foreign policy are amplified by the last big difference between Mr Trump‚Äôs first term and a possible second one: he would be less constrained. The president who mused about firing missiles at drug labs in Mexico was held back by the people and institutions around him. Since then the Republican Party has organised itself around fealty to Mr Trump. Friendly think-tanks have vetted lists of loyal people to serve in the next administration. The Supreme Court has weakened the checks on presidents by ruling that they cannot be prosecuted for official acts.

> If external constraints are looser, much more will depend on Mr Trump‚Äôs character. Given his unrepentant contempt for the constitution after losing the election in 2020, it is hard to be optimistic. Half his former cabinet members have refused to endorse him. The most senior Republican senator describes him as a ‚Äúdespicable human being‚Äù. Both his former chief-of-staff and former head of the joint chiefs call him a fascist. If you were interviewing a job applicant, you would not brush off such character references.

When comparing the differences between the first and potential second Trump administration, the biggest difference is who Trump will be surrounded by.

The first administration was marked by advisors that blunted his attempts to do blatantly illegal and unconstitutional things.

Trump has said that hiring these types of advisors was his biggest mistake.  The heads of the DOJ and DOD in particular will be hand-chosen for their loyalty to Trump over loyalty to country.  

The biggest expectation of a second Trump presidency is that the full force of the federal government (including the DOD) will be turned against Trump's perceived enemies.

Financial and economic takes on politics don't generally judge politicians by social issues - they judge them on how it will impact the markets, the economy, small and large businesses, banking, returns, etc. 

It's why many people try to clarify that they are ""fiscal conservatives"" - to distance themselves from the social implications. It's as if they are saying ""I'll happily fly a pride flag outside my shop and employ women at equal pay, but at the end of the day it's my shop that I'm voting for""

This stance doesn't really hold up with so much on the line this time around though. When everything is more or less status quo, you can get away with ""I'll vote for my own interests"" but this time is so obviously different.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

Harris is very likely to pursue more regulation, but will be more supportive of international free trade & trade pacts and is far less likely than Trump to do anything too extreme or shortsighted.

Harris is by far the better choice from an economist's POV if they're looking at global macro.

They're also a heavily editorialized publication, unlike, say, the Financial Times.

So for Europe, they are quite conservative. 

It is a sign of how much the GOP has slipped away from these principles that the Economist keeps endorsing Democrats over Republicans as the Republicans have started regulating personal behavior a lot more and enacting more economic protectionist policies like tariffs and trade embargoes, an area that used to be the purview of the Democrats before the rise of the Neoliberals in the party. It‚Äôs a sign of how the parties are realigning, a process that started around 1992.

The answer to your question isn't easily answerable, but I suspect it might be due to how it might not be so clear cut. Trying to change the Supreme Court because you don't agree with a ruling, I think, might not be so persuasive. 

Moreover, it's not exactly related to voters, but rather the House and Senate and state legislatures to agree with constitution amendments.

At least tell us what they plan to do to prevent this kind of thing from happening in the future? Working on election reform, electoral college reform, gerrymandering reform, removing all the 'honor system' rules in our government and replacing them with enforceable laws, clearly defining fascist rhetoric and making it disqualifying for anyone to campaign against democracy, disqualifying convicted felons from running, requiring a security clearance test for the president/nominee that they're required to pass to run. Something, goddamn anything to end this chaos.

Or are we all just cool if 50.48% of the country votes for fascism and to end democracy altogether, the rest of us are all just going to go along with it as long as it was voted for democratically? 4 years from now when Trump(or Vance at this point) gives himself another 4 terms without an election as he constructs camps for immigrants and undesirables we're all going to think back and say ""Well at least Harris ran an honest campaign.""

You could say it's declining in value versus gold (has been for decades very slowly) or versus BTC since it's $70k for a BTC.   But the DXY is a trade index and so everything above 100 on the DXY is more valueable than the rest of the field.   The USD has been fine...it did drop to 89 points at the beginning of the pandemic, and that was because the Gov/Central bank printed so much money (devaluing the USD)...but then the rest of the world did the same thing, printed a shit ton of their own currencies to plug the pandemic hole in the economy. 


You probably think it's declining because you see businesses closing, and you feel the on pain on the ""street"" because the printed money ended up in all the rich people's pockets.  AND you are getting news that says that the BRICS is strong (it's not) that the US position is on shaky ground globally maybe?  It's mostly propaganda from the east...dictators who exploit the cracks in our society (inequality).  We have problems, we can solve them, but we are still the shiniest penny of the bunch. 


Trumps not the answer, as your gut tells you, but don't fall in the trap of thinking it's all pain and damage.  We need to tax those un-earned (not un-realized) gains at the source (for instance Elon's stocks should be taxed when issued, at the corporation that does the issuing) - put it to work really building things better going forward cuz that lifts everyone up from the gains.  And then we can all celebrate Tesla's success and Elon will still be a billionaire, less a few billion sure, but we won't mind him waving a flag like a goof.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

* AIDS/HIV
* Cancer
* Cerebral palsy
* Depression and other mental health disorders
* Dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs
* Diabetes
* Epilepsy
* Gender dysphoria
* Heart disease, coronary artery, bypass surgery
* Hemophilia
* Hepatitis C

* Obesity
* Paraplegia
* Paralysis
* Pregnancy
* Pending surgery or hospitalization
* Sleep apnea

Fucking Risk pools man.  Republican answer for cheaper insurance for people to bend over grab there fucking knees and take it up the ass as far as when they get sick.  There is a reason the ACA requires everyone to have insurance.  By setting up Risk pools you move the money away from the whole population to instead fucking over people who are sick so they pay higher premiums.  While healthier people pay lower ones.  Sounds great right?   WRONG because what ends up happening is that insurance will then purposely funnel people that cost more then they take in and the costs start exploding in those risk pools and now you have made things worst about overall costs.  And the low risk plans probably wouldn't cover shit anyways like they did in the past in these setups.  I can't stand how Republicans keep wanting to go back to the past like this.

"‚ÄúIf the only way we can keep ‚Äòthose people‚Äô from getting health care is to also give up OUR health care, then I guess that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll do.‚Äù 

This has nothing at all to do with Obamacare, or health care.  In fact, the individual mandate was a Republican centerpiece of healthcare reform since 1993.  Several times, individual mandates were brought to the floor by republicans such as Cooper, Lugar, and I think Hatch proposed it as well.  The heritage foundation and Gingrich were also ALL IN on individual mandates.  For almost 15 years, the Republican Party position was there could be no health care reform without individual mandates.  Ted Kennedy opposed the mandate so it never made it anywhere.

Lately the Heritage Foundation has worked hard to deny they were involved, but it‚Äôs entirely in the public record.

The point is, that the Republican objection has never had anything to do with the mandate.  That was always a cover story.  They opposed ACA because (a) it took healthcare policy control away from the employer class, creating career mobility, and especially interstate mobility for families; (b) it guaranteed a right to healthcare to undesirables like gays; and (c) because it ended up being called ‚ÄúObamacare‚Äù.  Republicans thought they could derail it by attaching it to a black guy like it was still 1957, but the Dems quickly co-opted the term as a brand.  Ooops.

"That'd be a reckless move for Mike Johnson to make dismantling Social Security a top GOP agenda item. Social Security is a safety net that's been around for almost 90 years. The GOP's main support base is the older generations, the same people who would be left without the retirement security they‚Äôve been paying into their entire working lives. 

What‚Äôs the alternative for people who don‚Äôt have high-paying jobs or stock market investments to rely on? For context, Social Security is funded by payroll taxes, which we all contribute to with the understanding that these funds will support us later in life. If Social Security is scrapped, what guarantees will there be that private investments can deliver the same level of security? And what happens to people in lower-income brackets who simply can‚Äôt afford to save as much privately? We‚Äôve all seen the ups and downs of the market‚Äîmany experienced the losses of 2008 and saw retirement accounts shrink. So if we run into another crash, like experts predict would happen in the first year or so under [Trump's financial/economic plan](https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans), then are all the retirees just screwed??

I‚Äôd genuinely *love* to hear from supporters of this agenda: do you think privatized retirement is the answer? Or do you feel there‚Äôs a middle ground that addresses Social Security‚Äôs sustainability without eliminating it entirely? Because at the end of the day, it‚Äôs not just about ‚Äòfinancial freedom‚Äô‚Äîit‚Äôs about what we owe to the people who‚Äôve been contributing to this country all their lives.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

> If former President Donald Trump returns to the White House, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., says he will take another swing at repealing the Affordable Care Act, legislation that was enacted by former President Barack Obama in 2010 to expand health care coverage to poorer and middle-class Americans.

> &quot;Health care reform&#039;s going to be a big part of the agenda. When I say we&#039;re going to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda, we got a lot of things still on the table,&quot; Johnson said at a campaign event for GOP House candidate Ryan Mackenzie in Pennsylvania.

> &quot;I don&#039;t want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE. Obamacare Sucks!!!&quot; Trump said on Truth Social.

Depends on local standards but usually you qualify for 100% coverage if you earn 2x or some places up to 3x the federal poverty level. Even if you already have insurance or Medicare, the FA will cover whatever your primary insurance does not. 

Call up your local one today and ask to apply for their Financial Aid if you have any outstanding bills or expect upcoming bills - it could even cover your PCP doctor visits if they're affiliated with a hospital group (many are these days in order to bill insurance for facility use).

The Healthcare industry in America is big business. 

Healthcare is one of the largest and fastest-growing sectors in the U.S. economy. As of recent years, healthcare ranks as the largest industry in the U.S. in terms of employment and GDP contribution. It surpasses other major sectors, including retail, construction, and manufacturing. The U.S. spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, with healthcare expenditures exceeding $4.3 trillion in 2021, which accounted for nearly 20% of the U.S. GDP.

Key drivers for healthcare‚Äôs size include an aging population, advances in medical technology, chronic disease prevalence, and a focus on health services and pharmaceuticals.

They want Medicare dollars to go elsewhere or completely divest of economic activity. That includes subsidies to health insurers. 
They‚Äôre mad about a tax on medical devices, a surcharge on high-income earners, and penalties for larger employers who do not offer health coverage.

Who benefited most from Obamacare?

The biggest winners from the law include people between the ages of 18 and 34; blacks; Hispanics; and people who live in rural areas.


Why are Republicans against the Affordable Care Act?

The opposition to a government role in health care is based on the fact that that the vast majority of our citizens do not trust their government. Republicans are much less trusting of the federal government and much less supportive of a government role in health care than Democrats.

How do Democrats and Republicans differ in health care?
Democrats would emphasise public and private risk pools to increase coverage, whereas Republicans would rely more on individual insurance markets. The Democratic candidates would require employers to either provide health insurance to their employees or contribute to such coverage.

Do Democrats want public healthcare?
Democrats believe that quality, affordable health care is a right ‚Äì not a privilege ‚Äì for every American.

Who actually pays for Obamacare?

The federal government and the states share responsibility for financing Medicaid, with the matching rate varying by state and between the new adult group and other eligibility groups.

How many people supported Obamacare?
Across coverage groups, a total of 45 million Americans are enrolled in coverage related to the ACA, the highest total on record. This represents 14.1 million more people enrolled than in 2021 (a 46% increase) and 32.5 million more people enrolled than in 2014 (a 258% increase, or more than triple).

"I‚Äôll always say that MJ is my GOAT, but lebron has the courage that Jordan never did- he isn‚Äôt afraid to take a stand against injustices.

"My guess is that very few voters are making a choice because a celebrity endorses someone. But people absolutely need to be reminded and prodded to vote. If everyone who was going to endorse Harris did so on the first day of early voting or before, this wouldn‚Äôt be news in anyone‚Äôs feed today. It is the slow trickle of endorsements that will whittle away at the low information voters until the finally give in and vote.¬†

If you actually want your candidate to win so much that you‚Äôll public ally endorse them, you‚Äôll also time your endorsement for maximum impact. Again, I doubt anyone was waiting to find out what Lebron things to choose between the candidates.

"Fascism: is a term thrown around quite loosely nowadays. It is easy to discredit someone by calling them a Nazi and associating their ideas and opinions with the scum of the Earth. Most folks aren‚Äôt able to truly distinguish the real characteristics of fascism because the waters have been so muddied. This topic and its complexities are something I‚Äôve taken notice of and have chosen to educate myself so as not to engage in inflammatory rhetoric.

I will attempt outline below the contributing factors that make up the fascist movement with how best to understand and spot fascism in today‚Äôs tumultuous and often weird political landscape.

I‚Äôve found that author Umberto Eco most enlightening in this endeavor because of his direct experience with Mussolini‚Äôs fascist regime growing up. He wrote about his experience in his 1995 essay: Inventing the Enemy.

The 14 points of Fascism:


Powerful and Continuing Nationalism

Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.

Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights

Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ‚Äúneed.‚Äù The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.

Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause

The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, ‚Äúillegal‚Äù immigrants etc.

Supremacy of the Military

Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.

Rampant Sexism

The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.

Controlled Mass Media

Sometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.

Obsession with National Security

Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. Immigration and border security are common talking points when enforcing this fear.

Religion and Government are Intertwined

Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government‚Äôs policies or actions.

Corporate Power is Protected

The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.

Labor Power is Suppressed

Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.

Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts

Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.

Obsession with Crime and Punishment

Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.

Rampant Cronyism and Corruption

Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.

Fraudulent Elections

Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.

In many ways, he‚Äôs similar to Berlusconi, the former PM of Italy. Berlusconi probably broke even more laws than Trump if we counted them all, but at the last minute, the Italian government changed the law that would have sent him to jail, specifically to protect him. Sound familiar? Today he‚Äôs still an influential figure in the Italian far-right, where people literally campaign on nostalgia for Mussolini.¬†",2024_11_01,05_55_02

"> Xenophobia has been a longtime Trump tool for instilling fear and anger, and it now includes calls for mass roundups and deportation of undocumented immigrants. In Sunday‚Äôs setting, it stirred memories of the pro-Nazi rally 85 years ago and the talk of removing undesirables from this good White, Christian nation. Trump has positioned himself as the defender of Christian nationalism and defender of ‚Äúthe cross of Christ.‚Äù 

> Undocumented immigrants are ‚Äúpoisoning the blood of our country,‚Äù Trump has charged, echoing a favorite Hitler reference to the Jews and other non-Aryans. Hitler also called the Jews ‚Äúthe enemy within,‚Äù another phrase Trump has appropriated.

The most common complaint of Trump and his followers during the 4 years he was president was that he was constrained by the administration and the very checks and balances that keep our political system intact, but also that define us as a unique country in the world. A country that I am also proud of. The impeachments were essentially the result of Donald Trump not giving a fuck about any of it.

Something very deep in humans, the thirst, the appetite for seeing people being bullied, ostracized (the loser who gets fired), then one person ""rising"" to the top at last, and being ushered into ""Trump World,"" power, money, glamour, satisfaction of all your most base desires. Not saying base desires are necessarily bad, but when you create a ""theater of cruelty,"" and people are tuning in week after week, it's a very satisfying (and dangerous because politics is not entertainment) narrative to millions of people. When Trump ran for President, these people ""MAGATS"" must have thought their ship was coming in.

Trump quickly took a dislike to Fauci early on because there was some confusion about wearing masks. It was a novel disease - the docs and scientists were having to figure this out as they went along.

">And there is so much anti government propaganda spreading by the right wing-taxes are bad, regulation is bad, government is bad.

Like Trump's no taxes on tips bullshit. On the surface, it seems like a great idea. But in reality, employers will be the only ones to truly benefit from it while the workers get fucked over. 

Explanation:

Most people don't know that your employer also pays taxes on your income. So if your income becomes tax Exempt then your employer gets a tax break too. 

This includes taxable tips. Even tho tips are paid by the customer, the employer still has to pay taxes on them. 

So if tips become tax-exempt, then your employer also gets a tax break. 

That is how your employer benefits. You probably don't care, and are wondering how you get fucked. 

The answer is FICA. That's part of your federal taxes, but it's not really a tax. It's closer to a 401k contribution or insurance premium. Your taxed income is how they determine how much you get if you pull social security or unemployment. Loads of critical shit is tied to taxable income. Things like loans and interest rates. The lower your taxable income, generally, the worse off you are. 

FICA might be painful to pay, but not paying it will be more painful in the future. 

Social security isn't just something for old people either, disability works on the same principal. So does things like workman's comp. You get sick or injured and have to go on disability or workman's comp? Good luck surviving on $30/wk.

I don't know what the average server makes, so I google'd it and Google's AI said $20,000-$30,000 annually. 

We'll use the higher number as an example. If you make $30,000, your weekly tax deduction would be somewhere in the ballpark of $70. 

You might think it's worth sacrificing social security, unemployment, disability, workman's comp, et al. to have an extra $70. But the day you need one of those services you'll have nothing but regret.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

"There's no cameras allowed in Richard Allen's trial(Delphi murders) and only 20 seats available to the public in the courtroom, so some YT creators have been sleeping outside the court house to get a seat, taking notes and reporting to the public what's happening. You can tell who the Trump supporters are in the comment section of these totally unrelated videos. It's a small, rural area so for his own protection he was held in the prison instead of county jail. He's been on a self harm watch and has had a constant companion, both guards and inmates, that he could talk to and play games with. He's had a tablet, was offered a TV, but he declined because he has the tablet, has a phone, a 12x8 cell with a window, rec time and at first he wasnt allowed in person visits because of the self harm watch, but his therapist suggested it would be good for him so he has visitation. He's confessed 61 times, given details only the killer would know. His attorneys leaked crime scene photos and claimed it was a sacrifice made by white supremacy Odinists, but blamed on Richard. Theres all these people who believe the conspiracy theory over the guy who has confessed 61 times. Yesterday we learned he feigned mental distress by playing with urine and feces and refusing to eat and drink. The therapist felt he was feigning because the prison allows them to miss 3 meals, but on the fourth they have to step in. He would miss 3, eat the 4th, then miss 3 again. He was proud of his weight loss and started working out. He went to therapy one day and said he isnt insane, isnt going to harm himself¬† and wanted to give details of the murders because he feels remorse. This lady kept spamming a live stream with, 'Richard Allen has been in solitary confinement, hasn't seen the sun in two years, denied food,water and mental help and falsely confessed because he was being tortured.

"The question has 2 answers:

Scientifically: 'XX' chromosome.

Culturally: Depends, on context.

Someone can throw the ball with no strength and someone can say ""throw like a woman."" So essentially when someone does anything culturally deemed effeminate someone may call them a ""woman"". So in a sense someone could consider themselves culturally a ""woman"" yet may not be one, scientifically. A better formed question would be: ""Give me the scientific definition for a female human."" If you cannot answer that, sorry that's delusion, no offense to trans, idc what someone does with their body.

Problem really comes down to people not calling a spade a spade and being afraid to state the cold hard facts. Couple this with poorly worded questions and it is just bait.

There's been reports that the Trump campaign isn't focusing on a traditional ground game and I'm wondering how much that's affecting their ability to push their voters to the polls. Helping with transportation, reminders to submit mail in ballots, providing information on early voting, etc etc that all helps drive turnout from your supporters. These efforts especially help with older people who may need assistance or aren't fully independent with travel capabilities.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

"One universal truth is that bullies and conservatives can and will always ""dish it out"", but can never ""take it"". That is because bully culture -- and the *sole* value of conservatism -- is respect for and obedience to [one's perception of] traditionally established hierarchy, and hierarchy dictates that those on top (in-groups) rightfully receive privileges, credibility, and resources, while those on the bottom (out-groups) are bound by restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources.


It's not the *act* itself that upsets them; but rather, the *social standing* of the person doing said act, as the second-greatest injustice imaginable is for those [they perceive to be] on the bottom [of social hierarchy] to have access to the rights, credibility, and resources reserved for those on top, while the first greatest injustice is for those on top to be bound by the restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources reserved for those on the bottom.

I made two points. One, it‚Äôs not possible for all of the people voting for Trump to be bad. Two, Biden spoke poorly, shocker, and the media narrative that has resulted isn‚Äôt good. 

Now, let‚Äôs be even more clear. I think Trump is an existential threat to our democracy. I think just about everything that comes out of his mouth is bullshit and loathe him more than any other human I‚Äôve never met. I am perpetually bewildered at his ability to have any support, and yet here we are. 

He could win this election, somehow. Millions of people have been duped, coerced, or worse enfranchised by his hateful rhetoric and false promises. And, on the margins, there are terrible humans who love him. And, that should scare all of us! In fact, I would NOT want to be on the same team as Nazi‚Äôs and other hate groups, Russia, China and North Korea. Personally, I take that as clear sign to vote for the other team. 

But the majority, who will cast their vote for Trump are probably just like the rest of us. They want to buy a house, go on vacation, raise a family, go to church on Sunday. They have a set of values that allow, or encourage, them to vote for the Republican.

The issue is that the average person is mostly concerned with making ends meet. And when they see Clinton or Biden making some rude comments they just tune out and go back to work and life.

"I commented this a few days ago, but I‚Äôll say it again:

I know we‚Äôre all nervous about this election, and for good reason. And in spite the fear I feel, my rational mind is more optimistic.¬†

The biggest obstacle Biden and the dems were facing was not inspiring people enough to go vote. Trump didn‚Äôt need to gain new voters, he just needed to makes sure his voters voted, because if the dems failed to inspire then he would win.¬†

What we‚Äôve seen is that voters are voting in record numbers. No, we don‚Äôt know who those votes are going to, but we do know people are feeling inspired to vote.¬†

So if people are inspired to vote, where is the enthusiasm? To me it looks like the Harris crowd is dripping in enthusiasm, and that‚Äôs not even including the crowd that‚Äôs enthused just to get rid of trump.¬†

"> The country absolutely needs Harris to win this election, otherwise the damage could take decades to fix, if the country survives at all.

Let's be clear here: if Project 2025 is enacted, the US you have known all your life is dead. We can potentially throw off the yoke of it, but doing so will likely see this country radically fall apart in one way or another.

This country is either about to course correct from fascism, or we are about to see a really, really bad time for everyone living in this country because our *best case* scenario is there's a peaceful path after Project 2025 is enacted to leverage our way out of it, probably after decades of civil unrest. If there isn't, we are very likely looking at two other scenarios: civil war, or ....consolidation of power.

A civil war is, frankly, the better of the two because a fascist American with the worlds largest nuclear arsenal, expansionist or otherwise belligerent attitudes and the world's largest military would likely end the world as we know it, without hyperbole. There is no universe that ends with humanity, as a species, surviving America becoming fascist. Your *best* case is we somehow don't end up sparking a global nuclear war, and a fascist America ushers in a new global status quo that is charitably described as ""dystopian"". Think ""16th -19th century diplomacy and commerce but with nuclear weapons and drones this time"".

Also on the topic of civil war ...anyone that says a hypothetical pro-democracy movement can't fight the American MIC co-opted by a hypothetical fascist government has not payed attention to the fact that we *are* the American MIC and also, that other places that aren't the American MIC have won against it in sustained protracted engagements. American military doctrine is cripplingly over specialized on the assumption it will close out conflicts quickly, under a few years.

Every single time that the USA has ever been forced to fight a protracted engagement, it has *failed*. Case in point: American involvement in WW1 was 19 months, American involvement in WW2 was four years. Compare this to what we did in places like Afghanistan(20 years), Vietnam (8 years),  or the the Korean War (Four Years). There's also the argument the American military was pretty ineffective against the protracted resistance of Native American groups across its history.

By the end of WW2 the American military was significantly exhausted; there's a reason why there was such hasty expediency to use nuclear weapons in the first place, the American military was powerful and large, but that crushing weight of it was being felt back on the domestic economics and the American public at the time was very war weary.

Basically: the American military is beatable. Its just going to look a lot more like the British ""Troubles"" than it is the 1st American civil war.

Also I am to be clear, not advocating for violence, not advocating for the harm of others, not advocating in any way for civil war or for any form of armed conflict, nor wishing in any way for the harm of others. I am merely stating that... in short: dark times lie ahead, this is one of the possible futures, and that is a winnable future for a pro-democracy coalition, if it were to happen, due to the doctrinal inflexibility of the modern US military making it highly vulnerable to prolonged, low intensity conflicts.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

If they don‚Äôt offer raw numbers in their poll, do not trust them.  Just percentages is super freaking annoying and it happens way too often and it tends to represent shady methods.

That said, who participates and why and how they were contacted are huge issues in polling.  

Pollsters also absolutely suck at working with minorities.

To compensate, lots of polls add weight to the few participants they get.  I‚Äôve seen some polls with only a few dozen minorities and then they add weights to them.  They could easily get a disproportionate group and add weight to them.

And that‚Äôs ignoring that a lot of polls use likelihood to vote based on previous votes to make statistical assumptions.  The midterm here had 35% turnout for my area.

"Electoral-vote.com has an interesting take. No clue how accurate this is, but it feels legit.

In 2016 and 2020, most pollsters underestimated Trump's level of support. His actual vote totals exceeded polling estimates.

"I have been trying to find a copium explaination for why the social indicatiors seems to tilt so heavily in favor of Harris (enthusiasm, ground game, donations, turn out) but the polls keep showing Trump either equal or ahead of her, without resorting to conspiratorial mindset.

My hypothesis: Decreased response rate has synergized with increased enthusiasm to break the models when it comes to reaching likely voters. We just cannot predict where all of those likely voters are to even ask them if they are likely voters. So while it might be possilbe to adjust your polling methods to normalize to some extent, you cannot know what you cannot know, and so there is no way to get good data right now.

I am not a pollster though, so I could be TOTALLY off base on that. I know that a lot of normal objections to polling are imagined as the actual organizations thought of them decades ago and adjusted already, it just really *feels* like something is off with how the campaings are going relative to one another. 

But the biggest aspect of why I am thinking this is literally just hope. I hope they are wrong. Because if they are not wrong, even if Harris wins, it says some dark things about our future.

Think about it. Everything has been going downhill since then, and the Republican Party has gotten more and more extreme since then. 

Assuming history books continue to exist, they‚Äôll put 2010 as one of the most consequential elections in the nation‚Äôs history. If Democrats win in 2010, they keep their state level advantage and the House. With more favorable maps, the Democrats hold onto the Senate instead of losing it in 2014. With control of the Senate, Obama is able to replace Scalia with a liberal justice, giving the liberals the majority on the Supreme Court. Not to mention by holding onto majorities in both chambers of Congress, Obama‚Äôs agenda wouldn‚Äôt have been cut short halfway through his first term, and he might have been able to pass even more reforms in healthcare, finance, and education. With more reforms and legislative successes to run on, Democrat turnout in the 2016 election would have been much higher, and a Democrat would have succeeded Obama instead of Trump. With that, we get even more liberal justices on the SCOTUS and all through the federal courts. The pandemic response team wouldn‚Äôt have been disbanded, so even COVID may have played out _much_ differently. And of course, Roe v Wade remains intact.

Instead, the left sat out the 2010 election, and the opposite of everything I just said unfurled. And it will take literal decades of record voter turnout from the left to even start undoing the damage.

EDIT: Literacy is more than identifying individual words, folks. To be considered literate, you must be able to read a passage, interpret it, and be able to identify its overall message.

If you read my comment and came away with the overall message of ‚Äúthe 2010 election is where we started going downhill because Republicans took an unprecedented amount of state power and used that state power to get even more power, and things could have been much different if the Dems won instead‚Äù, then congratulations, you‚Äôre literate.

Those of you for whom the takeaway was ‚Äúmaps and the Senate‚Äù, on the other hand‚Ä¶

That being said, with state level control, a political party can, among other things:

1. Suppress votes by doing things like closing polling places in strategic districts
2. Pass regressive policies that drive the other party‚Äôs voters out of their state
3. Change election laws to favor their side
4. Appoint a new Senator from their party when a Senator leaves to, e.g., join the new president‚Äôs cabinet

So a political party having control of a state government can and does make it much easier for them to win a Senate seat.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

"Can we all agree to just not stop paying attention following the election? 

The key to advancing policy is to shift from Campaign Mode to Advocacy Mode the second we win. This is when change can happen. This is when pressuring Republicans is a must. 

This is when you *persuade* and *move* the electorate that progressive policies are the BEST thing to do. Not when in campaign mode when you must meet them where they're at to win.

And so in this respect, I propose to emphasize 2 things:

**1) Campaign Finance / Election Reform** 

- Abolish Electoral College
- Abolish FPTP for something such as Approval or STAR voting 
- Overturn Citizens United and SpeechNow decisions.
- Crack down on foreign influence on our elections (laundering, SuperPAC engagement, foreign lobbyists such as AIPAC).
- Implement Publicly Funded Elections (or a Clean Elections model)

**2) Education on Critical-Thinking and Navigating Media**

- Teach Americans how to spot Formal and Informal fallacies in news & opinion.
- Give Americans a rubric for distinguishing truly Fake news from Real News. 


Like I want to see ads that *inform*; speeches that teach. Adopt the Katie Porter style of engaging the electorate with a whiteboard.

"A message from Ai Donald Trump: ""The human equivalent of dogüí© is Steve Bannon, who just got out of prison this week, after serving four months for contempt of congress. Bannon hit the ground running, saying that I should declare victory prematurely and just say that I have won. And because I'm an idiot, I'll do it now. So today, Thursday October 31st on Halloween, I hereby declare that frankly, I did win the 2024 election. 

I have been elected president. All voting must now stop, and any votes counted after today are fraudulent and were cast by illegal immigrants. I won California and New York, by overwhelming margins, and I even won Puerto Rico, which is a floating island of garbage, and can't even vote, but I won it anyway. 

So I want to thank myself, and no one else, for my incredible victory. 

But I won and all voting and vote counting must now stop, and I have called Brad Raffensberger in Georgia to tell him that I won Georgia, and I have an army of lawyers and armed redneck thugs causing absolute chaos, all over the country to flood the zone with bullsh\*t. So join me for the fake inauguration this weekend at Mara Largo. Will be wild!"" s/

No Republican can match the enthusiasm with which I filled in those ovals. My pen oozed exuberance.,2024_11_01,05_55_02
">More striking is the divide between the two parties, with 77 percent of Democrats saying they are more enthusiastic compared to 67 percent of Republicans.

A ten point enthusiasm gap is actually a pretty huge deal.  All of these ""likely voter"" polls we see are modeled based on turnout assumptions that don't factor in low propensity voters.  Because of course, by definition these people are not 'likely voters'.  So what happens when you build enough enthusiasm to turn out these low propensity voters?  (and yes, it has been found there is a direct correlation between enthusiasm and these people turning out)

The answer to that question is actually pretty obvious.  The larger the enthusiasm gap is, the more the likely voter models will be off.  If enthusiasm is equal, then the republican and democrat low propensity voters tend to cancel  each other out, but when you have this large of a mismatch, you would tend to expect a skew in the direction of the candidate that has more enthusiasm.

"The Bush story has been really hyperbolized over time. There is a lot of nuance to it. But it ultimately happened because it came down to 537 votes. The true thief in that election was Nader. 

2020 only held water because of how long it took to count the votes and how close it was. There was doubt that was able to be created for the base to latch onto. 

This is going to be so overwhelmingly crushing that while Trump and his supporters will be delusional, the institutions won‚Äôt be able to deny it. There are realistic models that show them getting to 300+ in the House and 54 in the Senate. 

It‚Äôs also based entirely on whether 5 Republicans don‚Äôt cross the floor, kick Johnson out and appoint Jeffries, to delay until Jan 3. When they can just Impeech the SCOTUS.  

They also won‚Äôt risk a Civil War they‚Äôll lose. SCOTUS is most likely playing Trump, so they have the leverage to get the Democratic Party to not ruin them instantly. 

Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney have also been planning for this. They‚Äôll split the GOP if they have to. Walz has been talking about IRV, could be a signal to allow a third party to emerge and be viable out of the gate. Cheney and Romney are both loaded. Cheney is deeply powerful in the Oil and Military industries too. Romney is connected to the Hedge Funds (the real powerful people we know nothing about) and the Mormon‚Äôs. 

There will be politicking sure, but enough Republicans will see this as their moment. Graham, McConnell, Romney are still Senators too. Lots of Republicans in the House also hate MAGA and will betray. 

Because the vote will be so overwhelmingly Harris that they‚Äôll see it. There will be no doubt. They‚Äôll be like ‚ÄúHe cost us the Nebraska Senate!? Fuck that guy forever.‚Äù",2024_11_01,05_55_02

"i mean, the true thief was also the supreme court and the right",2024_11_01,05_55_02
"2 things:

First, as a general rule, I don't take polls as gospel.

Poling on the day of the Brexit referendum said remain would win, they didn't.

Every single poll for the 2016 election said Hillary would win, she didn't.

The polls for the French elections earlier this year said the far right action francais party would win a landslide, they came third overall.

Not two weeks ago, polls said the Moldovan referendum on a new, pro eu constitution would win comfortably, it won by .35%

And second, in order to win, trump is going to have to somehow get more votes than he did last time, before he refused to concede, before Jan 6, before he was impeached twice, before the party's hard and blatant lurch to the far right, before roe v Wade was shot dead, before he was convicted of 34 felonies, before he quite clearly started losing his mind.

I simply cannot believe he has gained many supporters since then, to the contrary he's seemingly losing them hand over fist, both because they don't like what they're seeing and, well, a lot of people die in a 4 year span. 

And there simply doesn't seem to be any enthusiasm behind him anymore from people who aren't completely nuts, to win, he's going to have to get more than 75 million votes and honestly, I think it'd be far more likely for him to get around 60-55, if not less.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident Harris will win because I simply cannot see how he wins otherwise.",2024_11_01,05_55_02
"Virginia is +6.2 Harris and her team is already coaching on how to get through this. 3000 votes won‚Äôt make it close. 

Like I said, enough Republicans will stab him in the back if they have to. They‚Äôre fucking done too and don‚Äôt care if they go down as collateral damage at this point. 

Romney is already done. McConnell is a zombie as is. Graham is done politically. There‚Äôs 3 in the Senate right there. McConnell can have his final redemption and die knowing people won‚Äôt spit on his grave‚Ä¶ as much. Graham can live a life where he‚Äôd likely be left alone.

"Churches should have tax exemptions/nonprofit status revoked immediately.
>Currently, the law prohibits political campaign activity by charities and churches by defining a 501(c)(3) organization as one ‚Äúwhich does not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.‚Äù\
>The IRS has published [Revenue Ruling 2007-41 PDF](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-07-41.pdf), which outlines how churches, and all 501(c)(3) organizations, can stay within the law regarding the ban on political activity. Also, the ban by Congress is on political campaign activity regarding a candidate; churches and other 501(c)(3) organizations can engage in a limited amount of lobbying (including ballot measures) and advocate for or against issues that are in the political arena. The IRS also has provided guidance regarding the difference between advocating for a candidate and advocating for legislation.

In 2016, the entire electorate was pretty apathetic. Republicans just turned out better. 

It didn't hurt that the media was addicted to covering every wacky thing Trump did.

In 2020, it was a turnout battle, with Trump consolidating all right-leaning voters behind him, but ""Trump fatigue"" being a very real thing.

"For your consideration..... its a repeated pattern...

**1993 - Beatrice Keul**

Trump approached her at an event at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, and they talked for about 15 minutes. Afterward, one of Trump‚Äôs assistants told Keul that Trump wanted a ‚Äúprivate meeting‚Äù with her. She went, and Trump allegedly ‚Äújumped‚Äù on her as soon as she entered the room.

‚ÄúI was not prepared. I tried to do what I could to get rid of him. ‚ÄúHe kissed me on the lips and on the neck. He tried to lift my dress,‚Äù Keul told The Daily Mail. ‚ÄúHe was grabbing and touching my body everywhere he could.‚Äù She thinks that her height (six-foot-one) was what helped fend him off.

**2005 - Journalist Natasha Stoynoff**

‚ÄúAt one point, Melania went upstairs to change her clothes for the next photoshoot. And Trump said to me, ‚ÄòI want to show you this beautiful painting, this beautiful room. He leads me to this room, pushes me against the wall, and starts kissing me forcefully. I tried to push him, but he came back at me. I was in shock, getting smothered, and he had his hands here against my shoulders. I felt sick inside. I felt horrified, and thank goodness the butler charges into the room.‚Äù",2024_11_01,05_55_02

"This doesn't matter to Trump supporters. I've had some interesting conversations about all of the sexual assault allegations and they literally think EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. is made up out of thin air, on the spot, and has ZERO merit.

They say that due to the amount of time that has passed, and that anything less than audio/video evidence of him admitting he did it, or a video showing a woman struggle against him, is insufficient. 

The number of claims and the amount of times this is repeated has no bearing to these people. 

I will also say that in a few exchanges I have even gotten a few to straight admit that even if he did do it and it could be verifiably proven via video evidence, they would still vote for Trump rather than have a progressive in office. 

Based on that, there's no reasoning with these folks. Reasonable people know that it is not normal to have over 20 sexual assault allegations. I don't care who you are. Nobody else who is a successful CEO or politician has this many charges let me get against him, why is it just this one guy? He is either the most persecuted man to ever exist in politics, or he is lying.

Meanwhile, [only about 20% of rapes get reported to the police](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/24/what-the-data-says-about-crime-in-the-us/#:~:text=Among%20violent%20crimes%20‚Äì%20excluding%20homicide,%2Fsexual%20assault%20(21.4%25).). So, for [90,185 rapes reported in the U.S. in 2015](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/rape), there were about **331,240** that went unreported, and 811 false reports that named a specific suspect, and only **81** false reports that led to charges being filed. Since [about 6% of unincarcerated men have--by their own admission--committed rape](https://willamette.edu/about/leadership/president/pwgsah/pdf/lisak-undetected-rapists.pdf), statistically 76 innocent men had rape charges filed against them. Add to that that [people are biased against rape victims](https://web.archive.org/web/20180404081606/https://web.stanford.edu/group/maan/cgi-bin/?page_id=297), and there are orders of magnitudes more rapists who walk free than innocent ""rapists"" who spend any time in jail. 

For context, there were **1,773x** more rapes that went unreported than charges filed against innocent men. And that's just charges, not convictions. 

For additional context, [in 2015 there were 1,686 females murdered by males in single victim/single offender incidents](http://www.vpc.org/studies/wmmw2017.pdf). So **22x** more women have been *murdered* by men than men who have had false rape charges filed against them. 

For even more context, there are about **10x** more people per year [who die by strangulation by their own bedsheets](http://tylervigen.com/view_correlation?id=7) than are falsely charged with rape. 

*By their own admission*, [10.5%-57% of men admit to behaviors that qualify as sexual assault](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5756135/). Many [struggle to understand](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5756135/) that even a clearly spoken ""no"" means ""no."" Consequently, [1 in 3 women has been the victim of sexual assault](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/infographic.html), with [emotional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault#Emotional_effects), [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault#Physical_effects), and [economic consequences for victims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault#Economic_effects).

I hope he does. It's going to be a challenge. The lawsuits in Europe that Imane Khelif is bringing take advantage of their more lenient laws. In the United States, the First Amendment prevents a lot of those sorts of claims. And courts are *very* reluctant to step in when it's a political ad on top of that. Courts also give fair use an incredibly wide berth for political ads (music notwithstanding). Further, the plaintiff has to show financial damages unless it's per se, and that's a higher hurdle (and not available in some jurisdictions).

Martin is one of 1,600 Virginians whose voter registration was canceled after Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued an executive order on Aug. 7 ordering election officials to speed up the process of purging noncitizens form voter rolls.

The Department of Justice and groups representing immigrant communities filed suit and said the purge violated a federal law that bars voter registration cancelations so close to an election.

After the election, the appropriate State or local election entity will determine if the voter was eligible, if so counting the vote and notify the voter of the outcome. Approximately 1.9 million voters nationwide cast provisional ballots in the 2004 election. Of those, approximately 1.2 million‚Äîor 64.5%‚Äîwere counted. Additionally, any time polling hours are extended voters are required to vote using provisional ballots.

"Biden had stumbles and gaffes that made for some pretty rough clips but when you added context it was clear he was fine mentally. Slower, softer, definitely 'aged', but he doesn't have dementia and he'd still be able to stay on topic or get back on track if he stumbled, stay focused on details and specifics, keep up with people's names and locations etc. Also of note, but ever since he dropped out, he's seemed sharper overall than before. Weird as it is, the basic explanation that he couldn't handle the stress of campaigning might genuinely just be the actual reason that explains a lot of what we saw. Sometimes things aren't as complicated as we make them.

Trump on the other hand, he has some clips where he seems okay but the more context you add the worse he sounds overall, and specifically, the way he sounds worse is way more in line with dementia symptoms. With Trump he spirals off course, interrupts himself with half-remembered talking points, says random gibberish that he probably thinks is telling a joke and perhaps most damning, just outright stops and stands around to listen to music. He also does that death grip teleprompter lock-on that if you've ever worked with someone with dementia, you'd recognize 100% the tendency to fixate on 'anchors' like that to try and keep them tempered. This all coming in the context of showing up late for events, cancelling events outright, garbling names and places and walking around like he's had a stroke. Anyone who has worked with someone with dementia would recognize this stuff for what it is and he's still in the light of lucidity for the most part and he can still mask it somewhat, but the overall context is degrading for real and by the time these symptoms emerge it's pretty much 12 months or so before he's going to be struggling to form sentences at all.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

"***From Rolling Stone‚Äôs Nikki McCann Ramirez:***

*The former president is falsely claiming that thousands have voted illegally in Pennsylvania as officials identify and remove fraudulent registrations.*

Donald Trump isn‚Äôt waiting until Election Day to accuse Democrats of running a large-scale voter fraud operation in Pennsylvania, despite local election officials assuring voters that the systems in place to prevent fraudulent voting are working.

For days now, the former president has been stoking claims of electoral fraud in the key swing state.

On Thursday, Trump claimed that ‚ÄúWe caught them CHEATING BIG in Pennsylvania. Must announce and PROSECUTE, NOW!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a CRIMINAL VIOLATION OF THE LAW. STOP VOTER FRAUD! CHECK OUT KAMALA‚ÄôS NEW SLEAZEBAG LAWYER. WE ARE ON THEM ALL THIS TIME! Who would have ever thought that our Country is so CORRUPT?‚Äù He wrote on Truth Social.

‚ÄúPennsylvania is cheating, and getting caught, at large scale levels rarely seen before, Trump wrote in a separate Truth Social post on Wednesday ‚ÄúREPORT CHEATING TO AUTHORITIES. Law Enforcement must act, NOW!‚Äù

It‚Äôs long been clear that Trump has been planning to weaponize claims of election fraud in order to ensure his victory in 2024, and it‚Äôs no surprise that he is spreading disinformation regarding an alleged scheme in Pennsylvania.

"I'm honestly afraid ""Get a Lot Worse"" is going to turn out to be an understatement.  Trump's been preparing to try to steal this election since 2020, and this time, he's got a lot more people in place at the local and state level to help him.

> Donald Trump isn&#039;t waiting until Election Day to accuse Democrats of running a large-scale voter fraud operation in Pennsylvania, despite local election officials assuring voters that the systems in place to prevent fraudulent voting are working.

> Last week, election officials in Lancaster County announced that they had flagged two batches of voter registrations - totaling 2,600 applications - for extra review after identifying signs of potential registration fraud.

> Regardless, Trump is running with the claim that successful efforts by state officials to stop potentially fraudulent voting are evidence that the election is rigged against him.

"Here is what I predict could happen and what Donald is trying to make happen. A Jan 6th riot is plan B. Plan A. Is sowing doubt that the states elections were fair and free. If enough doubt is made than the vote will go to the House of representatives which will then each get one vote. Currently there is a Republican majority in the House. This means the House of Reps will likely vote for Trump and Mike Johnson will certify it. If for some reason republicans dont all vote for Trump the the riots will commence and they will try and breach the capital to kill Congress again. 

I can tell you this 2 of the three commissioners in my county are already gearing up to deny our election results in our county in Pa (we are a red county). They are doing this so that even if Trump wins our county, Pa will still look like it has voter fraud. Trump is also saying Berks county has election fraud. Hes and the Republican Party (MAGA party) are already laying the ground work to get this election sent to congress. 

This plan works two fold because if he loses it was fraud. If he wins he beat the corruption and he can now put them behind bars.

There won't be anything even close to Jan 6 this time around. Biden deployed 10k national guard for a year with a mile deep of multiple fences in the wake of the first insurrection.

That only got so far because Trump was actively sandbagging response as the president. Refusing to authorize further security and purposefully egging on the crowd from his bully pulpit.

He simply cannot do that again as an outsider loser.

I have no doubt there will be a lot of maga idiots heading that way. I don't think they're going to be gathered in a big enough crowd and outnumbering police and security to get away with anything.

> The US could have averted 40% of the deaths from Covid-19, had the country&#039;s death rates corresponded with the rates in other high-income G7 countries, according to a Lancet commission tasked with assessing Donald Trump&#039;s health policy record.

> Between 2002 and 2019, US public health spending fell from 3.21% to 2.45% - approximately half the share of spending in Canada and the UK. To determine how many deaths from Covid the US could have avoided, the commission weighted the average death rate in the other G7 countries - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the UK - and compared it with the US death rate.

- 12 Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the Lord of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hosts.

">When I shared on social media outlets that I was intending to present a case to Christians against voting for former President Donald Trump, one person commented, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy that you even have to write it.‚Äù

I feel the same way. It's absolutely, completely heartbreaking to me that so many Christians actually like Trump and are willing to overlook his overwhelming number of sins. My only complaint about this article is that it's not long enough. There are so many more reasons Christians should not vote for Trump.

And I know they often say ""no one's perfect; we are all sinners"" and ""God uses flawed people."" Yes, those things are true, but Trump just goes too far. He's so un-Christlike. The most important thing Jesus did was the selfless act of taking the punishment for humanity's sins (dying on the cross and rising again). It's an act of grace and self-sacrifice, and it's a model for everyone to follow: putting others before yourself.

But the idea of putting others before yourself is so foreign to Trump. All he cares about is himself. He is vicious, combative, and doesn't care how many people he hurts. Jesus taught that being a leader/being the greatest means being a servant. Trump just doesn't think that way, and it shows every day.

So while I understand that no one is perfect, I don't see how Christians can bring themselves to vote for someone who is so far away from being Christlike. He has no problem selling Bibles but he should try reading one.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

Anyway, the answer is that numbers are sometimes used in the Bible in rhetorical ways and seven is used to represent totality. The use of six and then seven gets the reader's attention and emphasizes the totality. So it's not meant to be taken literally, like only six of those things are what God hates/detests.

I'm *terrified.*

I'm planning to flee the country if he wins.

Not ""leave the country."" I **left** the country last time after 18 months of searching for a job that would sponsor my visa. 

**Flee** the country is the correct verb. I don't have another 18 months to secure a job that sponsors a visa. My plan is to go to Merida, Mexico, which is the only city in the world that is A) Safe, B) Affordable, C) Allows Americans to stay for 180 days without a visa. 

It's not a plan. It just buys me *time* to form a real plan. 

I only came back to the US because I realized I was trans in the UK, UK trans healthcare is *abysmal*, and Biden was president, and I thought Trump was *done.* He wasn't. I should have stayed. 

As bad as the UK is for trans people, and it is **horrible**, so much so that pretty much the #1 book in trans literature right now is a metaphor for how *literal torture* is more humane than how the NHS treats trans people seeking healthcare... at least even at their worst, the UK transphobes just want to deny us healthcare, not round us up in camps. 

With Trump? When he says he's going to use the military against American citizens? I believe him. 

When Project 2025 says that ""transgender ideology is pornographic"" and ""pornography should be illegal and it's proponents imprisoned"" I believe them. 

I'm not going to put my faith that history won't repeat. And I'm not going to put my faith that democratic institutions will save us from him when they have failed, again, and again, to constrain his ambitions and abuses of power.

There's a photo taken of them before they left to tour the country side.  Both women were wearing menswear and looked happy and relaxed. That was the last anyone in my family saw of either of them. There's reason to believe they were sent to Ravensbruck which is where a lot of lesbian or ""asocial"" women were sent.

The sheer fact that this is known in my family, yet we still have relatives who are Trump supporters, is as horrifying as imagining what my great aunt went through then.

 Jews were not their first victims; they attacked the LGBTQ (and also the Disabled) because they were an even easier victim than the religious minorities or ethnic minorities in the country.

This isn't to be clear, to diminish the genocide of the Jewish people; but to be clear that the Nazis genocided *many* peoples, including the Jews. They killed the disabled. The LGBTQ. Other religious minorities like Jehovah's Witnesses. Muslims. Other ethnic minorities. Jews were the most convenient though because they were a highly visible minority group with very little international sympathy, and were nominally stateless, which meant persecuting them wouldn't diplomatically isolate Germany. They were an easy scapegoat to be othered.

I never want my experiences to be the reason a trans woman fears coming out and I never want my experiences to be a reason why any woman feels she has to place limits on her life.

I don‚Äôt really ‚Äúfeel‚Äù much about being trans or being a woman. I am a woman born with a very unfortunate defect and that‚Äôs that, I wish I could just move on with my life. The one area I feel differently though is how so many trans women, young girls, and older women have said that either trans women or me personally inspired them and made them more proud of being who they are in a world that says all of us should live in quiet shame. That makes me proud to be a trans woman.

Like the other person said, it is worth it. It is incredibly difficult and any preparation and support you can muster will pay off but for most of us it is not a choice and we can‚Äôt un-crack ourselves. These times are incredibly tough and hopefully they will pass. 

I had a wonderful six-ish months out before this hysteria began and while times were much worse in many ways a decade ago, that little period where I saw radical lesbians watching out for transbians in person instead of harassing us (coincidence lesbian bars died during this time), where American conservatives wouldn‚Äôt make me feel good but could be counted on to back me up as far as my constitutional rights to exist as an equal, where being trans wouldn‚Äôt come up over and over again during a single night out with the same peoples.

Or rather, they're claiming that being trans is an action. That one only becomes trans when one transitions, and that transition is itself a degenerate sexual act. That the public existence of people who have transitioned is people engaging in degenerate sexual acts in public, and as such is pedophilic abuse of any children who might witness it. 

And their entire mindset starts with the claim that the existence of minors who have transitioned is the product of pedophilic manipulation. That nobody is *really* trans, that this isn't part of who we are and how we were born, but rather that it's a ""contagion"" or ""ideology"" that children are intentionally infected with by predatory adults to turn them trans. That nobody actually needs to transition, and transition itself is inherently a degenerate sexual act, so when a minor transitions it is a minor engaging in degenerate sexual activity because some adult manipulated, groomed, or forced them into it. 

They are trying to seize trans children from supportive cis parents on the grounds that they ""groomed"" the child into transitioning, and that this is child sexual abuse on par with raping them.

"A former beauty queen has claimed Donald Trump ‚Äújumped‚Äù on her and groped her in the 1990s.

Beatrice Keul said she was forced to fight off the billionaire, whom she described as a ‚ÄúJekyll and Hyde character‚Äù, after she was invited up to his suite in a New York hotel in 1993.

It marks¬†[the second such accusation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/24/donald-trump-allegations-jeffrey-epstein-stacey-williams/)¬†against the Republican presidential candidate in recent weeks, after a former model claimed he groped her at Trump Tower the same year.

Ms Keul, then 21 years old and visiting from Switzerland, said she believed that Trump simply wanted to talk to her when he invited her to his suite in his Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.

‚ÄúWhen I entered, he jumped on me,‚Äù she told the Daily Mail. ‚ÄúI just had time to turn. I was not prepared. I tried to do what I could to get rid of him.

‚ÄúHe kissed me on the lips and on the neck. He tried to lift my dress. He was grabbing and touching my body everywhere he could.‚Äù

Ms Keul, who is six foot one, attempted to shove off and distract Trump, who was then in his mid-forties.

‚ÄúI think my size saved me‚Ä¶ I tried everything I could. Finally, I said ‚Äòlet‚Äôs talk first‚Äô or something like that, then he slowed down,‚Äù she continued.

‚ÄúThen he held my hand, he kissed me, he asked me if I wanted to drink something, he asked me to sit down.

‚ÄúIt was a bit Jekyll and Hyde. I didn‚Äôt know how to react.‚Äù

Ms Keul reportedly received an invitation to a beauty pageant run by Trump after winning second place at the 1992 Miss Switzerland contest in Zurich and reaching the final round of Miss Europe the same year.

After taking part in pageant events at Trump‚Äôs Castle casino in Atlantic City, she travelled with the 50 other contestants to the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan to meet the billionaire.

Trump is said to have introduced himself by saying: ‚ÄúHow nice to meet you finally‚Äù. He talked to her for 10 minutes before an employee told her he wanted a private meeting in his suite.

Ms Keul said she was telling her story days before the election on Nov 5 because she had recently found the documents from her trip at her home in Zurich, Switzerland.

The Trump campaign said in a statement to the newspaper that the claims were ‚Äúfalse‚Äù.

Last week, Stacey Williams, a former Sports Illustrated model, claimed Trump groped her at Trump Tower in 1993, putting his hands ‚Äúall over my breasts‚Äù as well as her waist and buttocks.

She made the allegations on a call with a group called Survivors for Kamala, which is made up of survivors of sexual abuse supporting Kamala Harris in the election contest against Trump.

The Trump campaign claimed that the story was fake and had been ‚Äúcontrived‚Äù by Ms Harris‚Äôs team.

\- Donald Trump is facing a new legal claim related to an alleged groping incident involving a former beauty queen. 

\- The incident reportedly took place in a hotel suite, raising serious questions about his behaviour towards women. 

\- This claim adds to the growing list of legal challenges Trump has encountered, including multiple lawsuits and criminal cases.

"I‚Äôve been saying this for a long time. In a ‚Äònormal‚Äô election, neither candidate wants to say they are way up, because that would lead ‚Äònormal‚Äô voters to potentially not vote. If supporters think it‚Äôs a landslide, they are more likely to sit out. I think this is a big reason 2016 happened the way it did. Polls were lopsided and people stayed home instead of voting. 

Now, Trump isn‚Äôt a normal candidate. His entire persona is winning. He‚Äôs more than happy to tell his supporters that he‚Äôs up 10/20/30 percent in polls even though it isn‚Äôt true. He‚Äôs happy to tell people he doesn‚Äôt need their votes. Even yesterday during his garbage appearance he seemed to claim he had 250 million supporters. He says these sorts of things nonstop, all day, every day. He gets away with it because his supporters aren‚Äôt willing to actually think about it or look up the truth, and news agencies are too  overwhelmed with his nonstop bulshit to stick to a single claim for more than a day. 

But, this serves multiple purposes for him as well. He wants people to believe that he‚Äôs up BIGLY. He wants his supporters out there parroting the lies in hopes that independents and democratic supporters think their votes won‚Äôt matter and don‚Äôt bother voting. He also wants that image of success to inspire his voters to come out in droves to be a part of this alleged historic movement, since 250 million votes for him would certainly be unprecedented. Lastly, he wants these lies repeated everywhere so that, when it doesn‚Äôt happen, he can claim fraud based on no actual basis in reality other than ‚Äòthey said I had 250 million supporters, so not getting 250 million votes can only mean I was cheated!‚Äô That‚Äôs how Trump operates, he repeats lies so often in hopes that they get accepted as truthful in entirety, or at worst just exaggerated but still rooted in truth. Supporters hearing that may think ‚Äò250 million can‚Äôt be true, but it‚Äôs probably at least (some number still vastly inflated).‚Äô That‚Äôs how people still believe these lies, they make them true with their own bias and personal justification. They feel good for not believing in the entirety of his lie, thus giving them a way to say ‚ÄòI am smart enough to know that wasn‚Äôt true,‚Äô but they still substitute fact for fiction and refuse to actually look at reality.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

"Exactly.

In 2020 about two weeks before the election, and after a particularly intense extended family gathering to celebrate my grandparents 65th anniversary, my mom made the comment that she was so ready for the election to be over and for everyone and everything to go back to normal. 

See, my aunt decided to use the occasion as an opportunity to share all of her newfound Qanon knowledge and the entire dinner devolved into a shouting match. This particular aunt voted twice for Obama, campaigned for Hillary, and somehow, in 2020 fell face first down the Qanon rabbit hole over the course of six months(covid lock down must've broke her brain).

I had to tell my mom that nothing would ever go back to ""normal"". The election being over will only make things worse if Trump loses...

Four years almost to the date, I was right. That same aunt is as unhinged as ever, and after not stepping foot in a church for 30 years, has now become the full Qanon/Christian nationalist/forever Trumper package.

> A closely watched measure of US inflation has slipped to its lowest level since 2021, within striking distance of policymakers&#039; target, after the Federal Reserve scrambled to bring down price growth from its highest level in a generation.

> The central bank&#039;s effort was designed to bring inflation down to its target of 2%. The so-called &quot;Core&quot; PCE index - which strips out volatile food and energy costs - rose 2.7% in September, in line with recent months, but slightly above economists&#039; expectations of 2.6%. While inflation has fallen dramatically, years of price increases continue to take their toll on many Americans.

> The economy has remained remarkably resilient - and continued to grow at a robust pace in the third quarter, according to data released on Wednesday - but almost half of voters wrongly believe the US is in recession, according to a Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian last month.

"For very different reasons. Recessions that come after rate drops is usually because the economy was already faltering and they tried to prop it up by dropping rates. This works short term, but doesn‚Äôt fix whatever the underlying cause of the economy crashing. In this case instead of just dropping rates to try to stabilize people, we pushed in a stimulus and raised rates once things were stabilized to correct the inflation necessary to not shutter the entire economy during Covid.

The one (and probably the only one) good thing Trump did was give in and do the Covid stimulus packages, even if he cut the 2nd one short and we needed to rely on Biden for it. Even though it caused a lot of inflation, it was truly necessary to prevent an economic crash. Raising rates gave us a slow fall rather than a crash. Now that inflation has settled, they can begin return rates to normal levels and the economy can kick back off even stronger.

This is all on top of the fact the market is still at an all time high, we just slowed our growth, it hasn‚Äôt stopped since shortly after Biden came in.

* Ex-Obama voters for Trump due to novelty effect and NAFTA economic grievances (Clinton?) are unlikely to turn back to him as they seem to have swept to Biden.
* There is a strong correlation with past Dem voting /early voting in favour of Harris, when comparing against safe states & historical votes. If anyone would liek to explain to me how Trump could win PA here, I would appreciate it as that's an apparent massive Dem lead in early votes there.

This guy voted for Trump twice despite Trump's repeated racism and numerous other flaws. But now he may not vote for Trump because of a racist comment directed at *his* race. When the racism was directed at other people, it didn't bother him I guess.

Actually he may still vote for Trump now. It just says he's ""considering"" not voting for him. So even after the racist joke, he may still push it aside and vote for Trump! I hope not.

"We're joking about this, but two things hold here:


1. People who follow the Economist who knows what this means
2. People who just hear the word ""economist"" and assume what it means


In both cases, it ties Harris to ""economic endorsement"" and that's what's needed right now.

"Here are some highlights from the Economist's endorsement article:

> By making Mr Trump leader of the free world, Americans would be gambling with the economy, the rule of law and international peace. We cannot quantify the chance that something will go badly wrong: nobody can. But we believe voters who minimise it are deluding themselves.

> The case against Mr Trump begins with his policies. In 2016 the Republican platform was still caught between the Mitt Romney party and the Trump party. Today‚Äôs version is more extreme. Mr Trump favours a 20% tariff on all imports and has talked of charging over 200% or even 500% on cars from Mexico. He proposes to deport millions of irregular immigrants, many with jobs and American children. He would extend tax cuts even though the budget deficit is at a level usually seen only during war or recession, suggesting a blithe indifference to sound fiscal management.

> The risks for domestic and foreign policy are amplified by the last big difference between Mr Trump‚Äôs first term and a possible second one: he would be less constrained. The president who mused about firing missiles at drug labs in Mexico was held back by the people and institutions around him. Since then the Republican Party has organised itself around fealty to Mr Trump. Friendly think-tanks have vetted lists of loyal people to serve in the next administration. The Supreme Court has weakened the checks on presidents by ruling that they cannot be prosecuted for official acts.

> If external constraints are looser, much more will depend on Mr Trump‚Äôs character. Given his unrepentant contempt for the constitution after losing the election in 2020, it is hard to be optimistic. Half his former cabinet members have refused to endorse him. The most senior Republican senator describes him as a ‚Äúdespicable human being‚Äù. Both his former chief-of-staff and former head of the joint chiefs call him a fascist. If you were interviewing a job applicant, you would not brush off such character references.

"If he wins this time, our great ‚Äòliberal media‚Äô would have had a large part to play in it. Not taking steps to fact check and clarify the misinformation/disinformation is extremely hurtful to the democratic process. Yeah we did it a few times is just not enough. It has to be done consistently. For example, about the economy, inflation has been historically low in the US throughout this last decade, with extreme money printing and low interest rates, simply because the supply side is always controlled. There is always abundant supply of stuff here and thus inflation was low, even though there is always excess money in the system. This is what happened during Trump‚Äôs time too. He DID NOT do anything in particular to effect low inflation. Then along came Covid and inflation spiraled due to global supply chain disruptions. The Fed‚Äôs denial through second half of 2020 and most of 2021 exacerbated it to a certain extent. And now inflation is close to target albeit with raised prices, which is absolutely hurting household budgets. But Trump DOES NOT have a plan to counter this besides harping on that ONLY lowering energy costs will bring prices down. It is laughable. And I have not heard the ‚Äòso called liberal media‚Äô point this out EVEN ONCE all the while claiming Harris does not give specifics of her plan. It is fucking sad. I fully understand that even if the media gives an objective take on this, it is not going to appeal to most MAGA but at least, to those on the fence, it might and the media has unfortunately forsaken this important role of theirs.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

Just a snippet:

""United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain late Tuesday called for working class unity against Republican nominee Donald Trump in the final stretch of the 2024 race, warning that the former president would serve the interests of his own class and embolden the nation's executives to intensify their decades-long war on the labor movement.

Responding to members who question why the UAW is involved in the political process at all, Fain said during a video livestream that ""we are up against a billionaire class that will not stop their attack on us at the bargaining table.""

""They will not stop at the workplace, they will not stop at the border‚Äîthey will take every inch we give them,"" said the president of the UAW, which has endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. ""We don't engage in political activity because we like a candidate. We don't do it for ourselves, as your union leadership. We don't do it for the Democratic or Republican parties. We engage in politics as a union because it is core to our fight for economic and social justice.""

Fain said that the United States is currently trapped in a ""vicious cycle"" in which the ""ruling class has waged a one-sided class war on the working class, and they've been winning.""

""We're in a vicious cycle where the billionaire and corporate class take more and more for themselves and rewrite the rules of the game to keep it that way,"" said Fain. ""They use their insane wealth to buy off politicians and elections. The lap dogs of the billionaires then pass more laws that restrict unions and keep working-class people down. They consolidate the fruits of our labor into the hands of Wall Street and corporate America, and that cycle goes on and on.""

""It is an embarrassment to our democracy when billionaires can openly buy elections. But it's also a devastating situation for the working class.""

Fain acknowledged that ""it's a bipartisan issue"" and that billionaires have ""done everything they can to buy off both parties,"" characterizing the GOP as the outspoken party of big business and condemning ""corporate Democrats"" who ""have also cozied up to the rich.""

**""It is an embarrassment to our democracy when billionaires can openly buy elections,"" said Fain. ""But it's also a devastating situation for the working class.""**

But in the 2024 election, Fain argued, the choice is stark.""",2024_11_01,05_55_02

This all regulated at a denomination level for us, with paid staff looking over things.¬†

That might sound strange but it puts into place a ton of structure that makes it a lot harder for them to do shady stuff. Although no system is perfect.¬†

Non denominational churches can govern themselves however they want. They don‚Äôt answer to outside authorities so unless they have built in transparency there‚Äôs a lot more room for dishonesty.

"TEXT

A new Harris-Walz campaign ad voiced by actor Julia Roberts encourages women to vote for Vice President Harris in the presidential election, even if their husbands are backing former President Trump.

The Roberts ad also alludes to abortion rights, which is seen as a pivotal issue in a race that has seen Trump with big polling leads among male voters and Harris with a large lead among female voters.

‚ÄúIn the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want. And no one will ever know,‚Äù Roberts says in the ad as a woman on screen meets up with her husband after casting her ballot for Harris.

The voter winks at a fellow female voter as her husband asks if she made the ‚Äúright choice.‚Äù

Republicans have responded to the video with outrage, with some claiming that a wife lying about her vote is as bad as an affair.

‚ÄúIf I found out Emma was going to the voting booth and pulling the lever for Harris, that‚Äôs the same thing as having an affair,‚Äù Fox News host Jesse Watters said on air Wednesday in a clip highlighted by Mediaite. 

Other GOP members including Charlie Kirk said the thought was ‚Äúnauseating.‚Äù

> Republicans are about twice as likely to vote early in person as by mail or absentee ballot, while more Democratic voters will vote early by mail than vote in person before Election Day.

> Early voting opportunities have expanded in recent years, and the 2024 election could be the second in which more ballots are cast before Election Day than on it.

Trump has a lot against him to cause a republican to not vote for him or to vote against him. Any republican that is your old school constitution loving patriot will have turned on him after jan 6th.

Any woman who had a life saving procedure due to a miscarriage that is not illegal and would let them just die. And i know of a few here.

Or just anyone tired of his dystopian angry rhetoric.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

"The thing that I don't get is Zachary Levi criticized Hollywood for forcing people into the political closet. And said that him endorsing Donald Trump is career suicide. 

But what I don't get is why should anyone be forced to work with someone they don't want to work with. Actors are not employees so don't get to claim discrimination based on political beliefs- corporations and their employees can claim this when it comes to hiring or promotions etc. 

But actors are essentially contractors/temporary hires- they get chosen for roles and create affiliations with studios or directors for a set period of time.

If somebody doesn't want to work with Levi cuz he endorses Donald trump, then that's the person's legal right. You spend a long time working on a film- directors have talked about not working with certain actors cuz they know their vibes won't mix and a shoot is too long a commitment to tolerate working with assholes. 

But is that discrimination? No, that is just the person exercising his legal right to hire whoever he wants to for a role for any arbitrary criterion he comes up with. 

Zachary Levi has the freedom and right to endorse whoever he wants. And others in Hollywood have the freedom and right to not want to work with him based on his endorsement. He gets a right, others get a right too.

Studios have contracts nowadays prohibiting their cast from talking politics till their films release. This is to ensure the studios and their million dollar investments don't go up in flames cuz of a controversy from a statement made by an actor or actress.

 It's an insurance policy against public fallout and backlash and their effect on film profits. This is not specific to Republicans. All actors have to abide by these terms. The trickle down effect of a film getting bad press or getting embroiled in controversy because of the actions of its actors is massive. 

Why should any studio hire an actor who has views that may land the studio or production in hot water and potentially affect profits. It's not discrimination to not hire or want to hire potential wildcard humans who have a tendency to create controversy. A studio is looking out for its monetary interests. 

Levi made a choice and needs to live with it. In the same way as these Avengers actors will benefit from the goodwill generated by their endorsement, Levi needs to prepare for backlash from HIS endorsement. It may or may not happen. He may even receive praise.

Conservative filmmakers can join the fray and create films with their leanings and hire whoever they want. Levi doesn't get to claim discrimination if someone doesn't want to work or associate with him as he always has the choice of working with other conservatives in Hollywood. In his view, there are many like that in the industry so umm then there is no need to worry- work with THEM. These films however if this article is anything to go by have traditionally not done well. So there is that.

And both have their history of cringe-ness.

I for example am turned off from ever turning into a Republican cuz of their nutty anti-science beliefs,  their stupid Democrats run paedophilia rings conspiracy theories and Democrats control weather bullshit.

> From 1940 to 1944, reported polio cases doubled to eight per 100,000, doubled again to 16 per 100,000 between 1945 and 1949, and climbed to 25 per 100,000 from 1950 to 1954, before peaking at 37 per 100,000 in 1952.

And this outcome from the vaccine I think is astounding:

> Worldwide the incidence of polio fell to 1,919 cases in 2002, a decline of 99 percent since 1988, when 350,000 cases were reported. The United States has not seen a case of wild polio since 1979.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

You say that pharmaceutical companies are ""getting rich"" off of hormones for gender-swapping teens? Well, that would be a massive and dramatic amount of prescription, so surely it would be extremely easy to see the numbers for such rapid increases in hormone sales, right? How big of a population even is the transgender community to create this massive new wealth you reference? Because that would be an unbelievably large increase, too. All of this shit is based on them seeing so many panicky stories in right wing media that they assume that these things are happening literally everywhere and in literally the most dramatic and nonsensical ways possible. Go out in the world, it's pretty much exactly the same. Nobody is swapping genders to go to college. If you found one person doing that, congrats. You got them. That's the one.

"\-What do you do for a living? I guarantee I make more than you. You probably live off of government handouts.

\-During Biden/Harris' term, Democrats spent like drunken sailors (at least $5.5 trillion in new spending) which was the #1 reason inflation skyrocketed. Of course, I didn't get any COVID payments because I ""make too much"". The US debt is now over $35 trillion. My pocketbook sure doesn't go as far now than it did during Trump before COVID. I eat out less, travel less, etc. The cost of living here in Florida has skyrocketed, in part because so many people from the northeast have moved here to get away from Democrat policies.

\-The number of people with multiple jobs, just to help make ends meet, is highest on record.

\-The influx of migrants have cost the country (cities/counties/states) at least $150 billion, as well as increasing crashes on the highways since they don't understand US traffic laws (I'm a roadway and traffic engineer). For example, the state of Ohio is sending more Ohio Highway Patrol troopers to Springfield since there have been a large increase in crashes due to the influx of Haitian migrants. Migrants don't drive with insurance coverage either. Housing costs have increased in part due to the millions of migrants that have entered the country, but the liberal media sweeps that under the rug.

\-My FICA taxes have increased substantially under Biden since the cut off line has risen dramatically over the last few years.

\-The infrastructure bill has been a failure. There are no more projects going on than before. In fact, states, cities, and counties are cutting back on projects because construction costs have skyrocketed so much. The number of construction projects is no higher now than five years ago.

\-Disagree on giving credits for electric car buyers.

\-Biden spent $7.5 billion for electric car charging stations across the country. Only 7 stations have been built as of March, per a Washington Post article.

\-Disagree on all of the handouts given to selected classes. Of course, I never get any handouts, ever.

\-I don't care about issues such as abortion. Issues like that will be argued on and on, probably for the rest of time, and it doesn't affect me. I've been hearing about abortion my whole life.

\-Now why should I vote for the Democrats?",2024_11_01,05_55_02

"At the moment, much of the voting public is expressing rage.

People who prey on rage are popular.

Criticism is super easy and any dummy can do it, and most dummies do.

Intelligent and workable solutions are not rewarded with news coverage.  The news much prefers  racist, or homophobic, or misogynistic comment.  The news would much prefer to cover Nazis than discuss the pros and cons of tariffs, or tax reforms, or long term plans to make the world a better place.

On that note, I think that progress takes courage.  Change is usually scary.  

I would,love to hear people‚Äôs ideas for improving our country.

Here are a couple of mine.  I‚Äôm a retired doctor. Our current payment system is very difficult to understand.  No one can tell you how much your medical procedure will cost.  Requiring transparent pricing could revolutionize medical care.  

If we had a law that all senators who were in office during an increase in the deficit, were ineligible for re-election, the senate would immediately become very fiscally responsible and spend only what they had. In fact they would soon establish a rainy day fund to cover unexpected expenses.   

Term limits for congress and the senate would limit the sale of power and privilege.  People would still run for office, but it would be a known fact that their tenure would have time limits.  

I am not a genius, but many of you are.  I would love to hear your ideas.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

Inflation is now down to 2.1% so just point 1% from the Fed goal. To go from 9% inflation that Trump passed to Biden to so close to the Fed goal of 2% is remarkable and shows the strength of the workers in this country. 

Trump's goal is to destroy our economy along with help from Musk and from those behind the Project 2025.

Is our economy perfect yet, no of course not. There are still too many people without homes and without food or medications. Trump is not going to fix that, he will only make things worse for everyone who is not a billionaire like his friend Musk. Even Musk has stated that the economy will tank but within 10 years it will be on solid footing again. How many people will be out of their jobs, out of their homes, and without food during that 10 years?

"Agree on your points about the lack of thoughtful discussion and critical thinking. Sensationalism is what sells and the media is only in the business of selling anymore. 

To your ideas:

Transparent pricing - I‚Äôm with you (I‚Äôm in healthcare too) but it‚Äôs not enough. As you know the total cost of healthcare  is rarely known at the start and patients are not the best decision makers (or given the case may not be even able to weigh in on the decision). For an elective sure it pays to be transparent, but for anything else it‚Äôs pretty hard. Transparency would help. Normalization around procedures between practices also help in making apple to apple comparisons.

Deficit - interesting idea tying deficit to eligibility. The problem is we run a deficit economy and we‚Äôre unwilling to make trade offs. Politicians sell cutting social services all the time (especially ones that hurt ‚Äúothers‚Äù) but almost never talk about cutbacks in military spending. I‚Äôd suggest that public government certified audits of every dollar spent becomes federal law. That experts (not politicans nor courts) decide the budget spend. For example many a military decision maker has suggested cutting spending (or redirecting) from wasteful programs to more efficient or just straight eleminFed, yet we have politicians who order extra ships/planes/tanks the military doesn‚Äôt need or won‚Äôt matter in a future war. 

Term limits - yes. Also should bank owning direct stocks by a poltician or any immediate family member, full and accurate financial disclosures for immediate family, no direct business interests, mandatory retirement age, must vote in 80% of all bills, no pay raise without adjusting the federal minimum wage, full audit of all expenses, no back door political loans to their own campaigns, and banned from being a lobbyist or serving on corporate board for 7 years after leaving office.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

>Michael Morley, an election law expert at Florida State University, said the allegations in Lancaster County follow a common trend when organizations pay workers to help register to vote. If groups pay per application, or set a quota, an incentive is created for some workers to falsify applications. Often, he said, these instances are caught by election workers. If not, the newly registered voters are eventually removed from the voter rolls due to inactivity. While it, in theory, creates a threat for fraudulent votes to be cast that is almost always not what happens, he said.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a serious problem and it undermines the integrity of the voter registration rolls, it puts more pressure on election officials to detect this fraud,‚Äù Morley said. ‚ÄúBut even if it gets through that‚Äôs sort of the end of the line. It‚Äôs not part of a bigger picture plot to steal the election.‚Äù The issue is unrelated to an issue that arose earlier this week, in which Schmidt said Lancaster County broke federal and state law by denying some Franklin & Marshall College students from registering to vote or requesting a mail ballot if they had an active voter registration in another state. Though it is illegal to vote in two states, it is not illegal to be registered in two states, and college students have a right to vote in the state where they attend school.",2024_11_01,05_55_02

Why stop at just racism?,2024_11_01,05_55_02
">If you ask President Donald Trump, he isn‚Äôt racist. To the contrary, he‚Äôs repeatedly said that he‚Äôs ‚Äúthe least racist person that you‚Äôve ever encountered.‚Äù

>Trump‚Äôs actual record, however, tells a very different story.

It‚Äôll blow your mind when you realize just how far this pattern of false claims extends from his epicenter of narcissistic projection.",2024_11_01,05_55_02
"The article doesn't mention that he's the only presidential candidate ever [endorsed by Stormfront](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Stormer), in an editorial that encouraged their readers to ""vote for the first time in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests."" 

Or the frequency with which he was [retweeting white supremacists](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/07/donald-trumps-love-affair-white-supremacists/) for a while.",2024_11_01,05_55_02
"His hateful rhetoric about violent criminal immigrants flooding the border and talk about deporting millions of them is ridiculous, especially since Trump has hired illegal immigrants for decades to avoid paying Americans a living wage. 

And let‚Äôs not forget his racist talk about immigrants poisoning the blood of America, meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs wife and ex-wife are immigrants. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",2024_11_01,05_55_02
I'm not racist I just....,2024_11_01,05_55_02
"Unfortunately no one seems to care. I'm just so tired of this shit. Trump could literally execute someone on live TV and supporters would say it's a deep fake. I wish they'd focus exclusively on his insane policies instead. This type of reporting isn't swaying anyone.

Everyone knows he's a racist piece of shit, 20+ women have accused him of sexual assault, his own fucking people have called him facist. Conservatives rationalize all of it away for either the promise of their version of a white ethnostate or nostalgia about a better economy.",2024_11_01,05_55_02
