"Everyone, calm down. It is SO early and it is ALWAYS like this in the beginning. It's known as the ""red mirage"". It happens everytime bc smaller towns tend to vote more red and bc they are small, their numbers come in first.

By 10pm or midnight tonight unless it's very close there should be one state that helps tip the scales and we all should know a lot more.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Harris leading Ohio, no Cleveland, no Cincinnati in yet. 

  
WHAT THE FUCK",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"Folks, remember:

1: Basically no major cities have reported in yet in most states - they're huge and take time outside a couple of exceptions. Harris is behind right now...and then NY will finish counting and suddenly she'll leap ahead, a few smaller states will finish and Trump will go back etc. etc. Happens all the time since like...FDR?

2: Florida was never really in play and this is specifically by design by the GOP; not only do they have a true believer in DeSantis but he has actively been trying to make the state a worse place in order to drive out anyone more liberal/progressive than a Confederate General. If it wasn't for all the tourist trap places setting up shop way back when, FL would probably be one of the poorest, most abandoned states in the US and they know it.

3: Everyone thought Biden was losing too; until he suddenly wasn't. Calm down.

**EDIT:** Point 4: This was always very likely to be a close election with a good chance of Trump legitimately winning, even if myself and others think he won't. When it's a razor's edge like this, little things going wrong (or right) can tip the balance, so best laid plans and all. Though I would not be surprised if we see something nuts like TX electing Trump President but then also electing Allred for Senate dumping Cruz (because everyone hates Cruz even in the GOP) so it could be a interesting night.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Republicans will be in the lead for a while, by a lot. That's how the electoral college works. Small rural towns vote Republican so their results are in first. There will be a drastic blue addition once the bigger cities catch up. Just like in 2020, Trump will use this as a ""gotcha"" to claim it's rigged. To all gullible republicans, please don't be stupid and use that to think it was rigged if Kamala wins. Use logic.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Swing states like, say, Georgia have a lot of rural counties to cover. These counties have less people and therefore, count first and then report in. That causes the red mirage, because it shows a number that's disproportionally weighted to the Republican. 

But - and this is critical and why you all need to pop a Xanny or something - the massive, blue cities report in later when the counts are completed there.

So here's your trick. If you see a vote proportion that you don't like, look at the critical ""**X% REPORTING**"". If it's below 50%, the state is nowhere near done counting and cities likely are nowhere near reported. If it's over 50% and above, that's where you need to start to watch it closely. Even a 90% reported state can flip if the vote tallies are close enough.

TLDR: Relax and stop acting like the sky is falling, Henny Penny.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"1. Ohio is genuinely shocking to me. Who knows if it will hold out but I expected an absolute blowout for Trump. 

2. Georgia looks competitive, still hasn't counted most of Metro Atlanta. She's winning weird counties like Randolph while losing in the expected places. It's going to be the major cities + Metro Atlanta + Clarke county to win it out. If you look in Florida, she won Alachua county, where UF students are. I tend to think SEC college students tend to vote similarly so I think she will win Clarke (where UGA is, Athens). 

3. North Carolina is looking especially rough for Trump, possibly the Robinson effect. Political polarization has almost removed split tickets in most of these states. 

4. PA, WI, and MI has their votes come in. For PA, Kamala needs Metro Philly + lake counties like Erie + Pittsburgh + Northeast PA to win. And there is word of 75% turnout in Philly up from 60 something in 2020. MI and WI are a little easier because the biggest cities tend to carry the state and they break for Kamala. Metro Detroit and Grand Rapids will be big for Kamala. 

5. Allred is leading TX but I expect to start eroding. They need insane turnout in Houston, Austin, Metro Dallas, El Paso, and San Antonio before they can think about having a shot. I haven't heard anything positive (or negative) about that.

6. Decision Desk HQ, which I'm using, swings wildly from a Trump certainty to now trending back to 50/50. And it will eventually swing to Kamala.

When my dad died, he sent us a sympathy card. Like a legit sympathy card with a personal message specific to my dad (it was not a generic, one line typed card). We were flabbergasted that we received something and it has always stuck with me that Bernie thought so much of my dad and wanted to share his thoughts with us. My dad was not involved in politics in any way, shape, or form other than voting in elections.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

I don’t care in this case that he’s going to be in his late 80s when at this end of this term. He’s shown to be relatively sharp at his age, and as long as he lives and especially in his chairman position of labor and health, will continue to be a major voice that pushes the Democratic Party to be at its best.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"I do think if he was the general election candidate in 2016 and conservatives got to listen to him in debates and town halls, they would have voted for him.

People would have voted for the old white guy who was grumpy about big money interests and passionate about wanting to improve living conditions over the old white guy who was a braggart about his riches and full of hate in every speech.

Bernie’s message was exactly what the country needed to hear. If people heard Bernie talking about how we are all brothers and sisters and that a nation is judged by how we treat the most vulnerable folks among us, the country would have come together more instead of splitting further apart.

Bernie was saying at his rallies and news appearances that “I care about your children as I hope you care about mine” and that elderly people shouldn’t have to cut their medicine in half to make the prescription last until they could afford a refill, and that he is sick and tired of seeing unarmed black men being shot.

Gallup polls consistently show that 40% of voters identify as independent compared to 30% who identify as Democrat and 30% as Republican. As an Independent, Bernie was able to bring people in to the Democratic Party that didn’t consider themselves Democrats. As a general election candidate he would have grown the party beyond its base.

Idk if someone told him not to bother with the black church crowd or what, but you can't win (primary or generals) without them, and I actually think he could have made an impression if he's gone.

"I'd go as far as to say there's no one at his level. Even internationally very few socialists are as sharp and consistent as the man while clearly standing out from the administration. There's a reason the establishment democrats eventually had to include him to an extent in the leadership of the party.

Edit: People don't seem to get it, being a socialist in the heart of capitalism is playing politics in ultrahardcore. He was the only socialist mayor in an America Reagan won by a landslide. Definitely a contender for the most effective campaigner ever, the fact he came even close to defeating Clinton and Biden running with such a platform is an unprecedented feat I don't think will be replicated in decades.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

It was refreshing seeing Kamala hit the swing states hard in the last week.  She also had a better ground game in the great lakes than Clinton did and Harris ramped it up in a short period of time.  Hubris was a big part of that downfall.  I hate relitigating all of this because that whole thing was so frustrating.

"Agreed. As a foreigner I don't hesitate to name Bernie Sanders in the same breath as the likes of Franklin D. Roosevelt or Abraham Lincoln when it comes to impressive/great American leaders/politicians. Yes, he's not as influental as the other examples, but as you said, that's also due to the platform he's campaigning on (social democracy, in America viewed as socialism). Despite cancer like Fox News poisoning American democracy for decades now he still manages to steer the US in a more civilised direction.

Unfortunately he's really old now (still perfectly sharp, but things often happen rapidly in your 80s). Fortunately though, his influence managed to make young prodigies like AOC more palatable to your people.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Also, that Robinson guy was so catastrophically bad as a candidate that polls were showing him losing by like 15-20 points.  If he was only moderately bad he might have driven Democratic turnout to defeat him…..but it’s been obvious for weeks he was going to lose like 55% - 40%.  And Stein is pretty moderate.

> By Joseph Ax. - Democrat Josh Stein won the North Carolina governor&#039;s race on Tuesday, Fox News projected, defeating Republican Mark Robinson, whose candidacy imploded following a CNN report that he had called himself a &quot;Black Nazi&quot; and made other offensive remarks on a pornographic website.

> Stein, the state&#039;s attorney general, will be the first Jewish governor of North Carolina.

> North Carolina is also one of seven battleground states in the closely fought presidential race between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris.

"Because the US is a 2 party system, and with how polarized US politics is right now, so called ""split tickets"" are relatively rare.  This is when someone picks a Democrat or Republican for the top of the ticket, but then picks the other party for lower seats.

By the same token, it would take a near unprecedented number of split vote (people that voted for Stein (D) for gov, but Trump (R) for President, for Trump to win the state at this point.

Easiest case ever as the lawyers literally said it was fraud in court to win yesterday’s case.,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"""Voters who signed up for Elon Musk’s million-dollar voter giveaway are suing the Tesla Inc. chief and his America PAC, claiming entrants were misled about how winners were picked.

A day after surviving a legal challenge in Pennsylvania, Musk’s daily sweepstakes was hit Tuesday with fresh claims in federal courts in Texas and Michigan.

Jacqueline McAferty of Arizona alleged she never would have signed the America PAC petition and handed over personal identifying information if she knew the winners weren’t picked at random and she had no chance of taking home $1 million. In reality, the winners weren’t picked at random, but were carefully selected to be spokespeople for the pro-Donald Trump political action committee.""

I don’t care how “clear” he claims this law to be, it is untested and therefore by definition not clear since we don’t have much relevant precedent to base these circumstances on.

The 2nd part about the pollsters is just objectively false. Must required that people signing the petition be registered voters. That is by definition an incentive because the voter was the one who had to take action to register and then sign the petition. Random pollsters calling from a list of people to pay for surveys being filled out provides no such incentive. The very fact he’s trying to use this as an example shows me he’s a paid expert, and not being objective.

No objective lawyer would look at this and act as if they could say definitely one way out another on any of these circuses. There’s no precedent to point to.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"So... the tale of Elon Musk goes back before most people knew his name, and after daddy's mine money.

Musk was one of the core people at PayPal back in the late 90s, and he had a vision -- he wanted to make ""the everything app"" and call it X.  Does this sound a little familiar?

He was fully convinced that he was right, and kept pushing the company to do it his way.  But he always wanted to use a stack that *could not possibly work* in that day and age, and would have been a total rewrite of basically everything.  Does this sound a little familiar?

So he effectively staged a coup within PayPal while someone was on their honeymoon.  He started *forcing* his changes.  Does this sound a little familiar?

He got kicked out of the company.  He was effectively given a ""fuck off fee"".  They wanted him gone so badly *they paid him to leave*.

He is still trying, nearly 30 years later, to prove that he was right all along.  He needs to prove that they were the dumb ones, that he was the smart one.  It's why he's convinced his daughter hates him because she was radicalized (not because he's shitty to trans people), as well.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Rogan's errand boy quickly came in to inform him that Biden was actually referencing a Donald Trump quote.

"CONSERVATIVE TEXAS MEGACHURCH PASTOR FLIPS AND ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS:
“As an Evangelical Christian, I’ve voted Republican for 40 years. The Republican Party I knew and loved would have never chosen as its nominee the adulterous, childish, habitually lying and criminally convicted Trump. It’s sickening to see people who say they read and believe the same Bible I do not only refuse to denounce Trump but endorse his candidacy.
I’m supporting Harris because she’s a person of good character, with integrity, leads with love, and is someone who can be trusted. Oh, and she can pass a background check, unlike Trump, with his numerous adulterous affairs, his multiple felony convictions, his race-baiting, his violent rhetoric, his repeated lies, and his not resembling Christ or His church in ANY way.”

"Rogan has always had the problem where his opinions and thoughts are only relevant to the most recent guest on his podcast, in the last week, he said three of the most outspoken conservative personalities on his podcast, it’s no wonder the only thing he can see/understand is the conservative viewpoint. 

It’s always been a problem with Joe Rogan. He just doesn’t seem to be able to think critically enough to form his own opinions. Based on the information he’s given however he merely co-ops the opinions of the people he’s spoken to.  

It’s honestly been pretty sad to watch, his turn from the beginning of Covid to now is complete with his endorsement of Donald Trump.

But it’s so funny to me you se clips where he talks about what he cares about like he’s pro choice and has talked about how it’s terrible to think his daughter could be r worded and not being able to get her an abortion. Laughing in trumps face on his podcast last week when he almost admitted to losing the 2020 election. And many other things to then turning around and being like yeah Trump still my guy even though he’s against a lot of my values.,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"There’s a VERY small subset of Americans that Trumps policies actually help (the ultra rich), Joe Rogan became one of them very recently. I’m not surprised about his flip flopping because he’ll come out ahead financially with a Trump presidency.

"Rogan, Oct 11, 2022
""My friend, his wife is a schoolteacher, and she works at a school that had to install a litter box in the girls room because there is a girl who's a furry, who identifies as an animal.” He went on to assert that “her mother badgered the school until they agreed to put a litter box in one of the stalls.”  
“So this girl goes into the litter room or to the girl's room and urinates or whatever — I don't know if she poops in it, that's pretty gross.”  
“Use a [expletive] bathroom. It's sanitary. It's much better. Like, you want your house to smell like human pee?”

Nov, 2022:
""I fed into that and let me. I should probably clarify that a bit. I have a friend and my friend’s wife is a school teacher. And she told him that there was discussions in the school that the mother wanted to put a litter box in a school.” That would be a bit different from actually installing a litter box in the girl’s room as Rogan had said in the previous broadcast. Rogan then mentioned how he and his friend’s wife had made some more inquiries and concluded, “I don’t think they actually did it.” Rogan went on to say, “I think there were discussions about doing it because there was one particularly wacky mother. It doesn’t seem like there was any proof that they actually put the litter box in there.”

Litteral BS, in both cases. 
There were no ""discussions about doing it because there was one particularly wacky mother.""

I was an OG podcast listener in the late 2000s, and back then just trying to find enough halfway decent podcasts you wanted to listen to was not easy. Rogan wasn’t really up my alley, I was an alt-comedy fan, but he was one of the people putting out the most content at that time, multiple 2-3 hour shows a week, and it was almost all fairly interesting and usually funny. So I became a weekly listener (like you, I skipped most MMA stuff, also I could never stomach Joey Diaz) and while I fell off a bit as I got older, I was still tuning in for pretty much any guest I was mildly interested in. 

But around the 2016 election he started getting weird about Hillary. I was hearing the exact thing you’re describing, he’d discuss criticisms of Hillary extensively and just ignore any counterpoints, or hypocrisy from the right. Got obsessed with her emails (never gave a fuck when Trump did the same thing), got obsessed with Benghazi. You could just feel a shift away from being open minded to wanting to push a very clear political agenda. And then he doubled down during covid. And then he doubled down again this year.

There's studies where they test people's knowledge of current events and right wing Americans know less than people who literally don't watch or read any news.


Their bubble doesn't show Trump doing anything dumb, but DORS intentionally accuse his opponent of the exact weaknesses Trump has (it's a common manipulation tactic for propaganda).


This means that their brainwashing almost guarantees that anything that sounds bad must be Trump's opponent.


Democrats, on the other hand, follow actual news, which is easy because actual news is agreed upon in every newspaper, magazine, TV channel etc around the world. You can read an article from Japan, the U.S., UK, Australia, South Korea, etc and they'll agree on reality (with some exceptions if it is Murdoch owned, but even many of Newscorps properties report actual news like the WSJ or Marketwatch).

Yesterday there was a veritiserum video that made was making the rounds about how your political identify incorrectly biases you against logically thinking about data, ie when you made the experimental study in gun control your mind wasn't processing the numbers as correctly depending on if the data reaffirmed your pre-existing beliefs.


The thing that no-one pointed out was that on the graphs, yes most people had biases that interrupted their ability to see what the number was saying(in the vacumn of that fake study made up for the experiment, the participants knew it was fake), but higher intelligence people still did better than lower intelligent people, and that when you look on the graph, I'm 80%sure it had dem leaning participants had a 10-15% more people getting it right across the board in all possible study combos. 


It was one of those things where a lot of the lines looked similar enough, but if you paused the video and actually look the scale of the chart your realize thatvit was actually a dang big difference. 


I understand it wasn't supposed to be a political video per se, they could have used sports and hometeam bs visiting team or something along those lines. But it totally reminded me of those charts that came out a couple years back about how republican voters basically have flip flopped on drone strikes depending on who was in office and democrats mostly stayed the same.

"Female turnout in the US election is set to be high, according to early exit polls that could prove to be a boost for Kamala Harris.

Early data shows women accounting for some 53 per cent of the vote, six points ahead of men, and one point up on the last election.

In another possible boost for Harris, voters think the state of democracy is the most important issue at this election

Ms Harris has put abortion and the threat to democracy posed by Donald Trump at the centre of her campaign.

The exit polls showed 35 per cent of voters say the future of democracy in the US is a top concern, ahead of the economy (31 per cent), abortion (18 per cent) immigration (14 per cent).

Millions of voters across the US have flocked to polling stations with reports of record turnout in a number of states, including key battlegrounds such as Georgia and North Carolina.

"> Exit polls are conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool on behalf of a consortium of media companies: CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC. They get their name because interviewers on Election Day are stationed outside roughly 500 polling locations throughout the country, where they conduct surveys with a randomly selected sample of voters who’ve just cast their ballots. The polling locations were themselves selected through random sampling, meaning the resulting interviews should be representative of Election Day voters across the state or nationally. The interviewers call back to report their results several times throughout the day – which means that the early numbers will likely change as more data comes in.

It’s based on exit polling. Here’s how they get the numbers.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

99% of that 80% were probably annoyed they had to endure another two months of redundant campaigning.

"Yes. The problem that this article isn't highlighting, and comments aren't acknowledging, is that exit polling is a random sampling of people leaving polling stations.

So this isn't X% of ""voters"" but of ""people surveyed"" and, more importantly, ""people who answered the survey."" So the accuracy of these numbers applied to the general electorate depends on how closely those surveyed align with people voting and whether they answered (and told the truth when they did).

So there's a lot that can go wrong relying upon exit polling and even if it's accurate the numbers (30% democracy and 18% abortion rights) aren't particularly reassuring. It should be a blowout. The fact it's not a blowout is a huge problem, imo.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Even for those I wouldn’t say are outwardly sexist in the US, as in, they don’t typically go around saying things and maybe show significant support for their wives or whatever, it seems there is a point where these people even if they don’t realize it can’t help but see a woman and imagine others will be able to take advantage of them because they are a woman.

Two factors:

1) Trump had a ""how bad could it be""/political 'outsider' thing in 2016. We ALL know exactly what he is now. A decided known-quantity. And he's only gotten worse since then.


2) Hillary was by FAR the most unimpressive candidate I've ever seen, 2nd only to John Kerry in 2004. Had massive amounts of baggage, a complacent campaign that wasted time trying to run up the score and failed on fundamentals, and had the Comey October Surprise of reopening the ""buttery males"" thing days before the election (which then ended up as a nothingburger).

It's been attested that Hillary was the only candidate that Trump could beat, and I firmly agree with that sentiment.

"3) Democrats thought Trump couldn't really win.  He was a joke and the forces of normality and business-as-usual would surely deliver a business-as-usual president.

Including me, honestly. I voted, but my mood was like ""welp, time to do my civic duty and wrap up this circus,"" not like ""oh god oh god oh god PLEASE don't let this happen.""

And I think we all learned a lesson that we won't forget for a long time.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"Both of your factors are debatable. One of the recent themes of Trump's rallies has been ""are you better off now or four years ago,"" and republicans think of the time before the pandemic when he says that. Obviously the economic situation the pandemic left the world in is not Biden's fault, but uneducated voters think it is. 

Kamala doesn't have the Clinton name as baggage, but she does have Biden's presidency weighing her down. Biden has surrounded himself with competent people and done a good job as President, but he has a low approval rating with many voters blaming his administration on immigration and the economy (both hot issues). Also Hilary had the super-delegate controversy and Kamala wasn't primaried, and both are female candidates running against Trump. There are differences as you point out (also abortion and many Americans concerned about the state of democracy), but there are similarities too.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Ah, yeah, I see what you're saying better now. I'm also hoping that election day turnout is in Harris' favor - would keep any red mirage effects from giving Trump an excuse to bitch and moan for a week while the last votes are counted.

I also wouldn't worry too much about any individual interaction. High stress and high bot activity times, these. Things will hopefully calm down in a day or two... or a week.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"We have to see how many republicans flip. 

Exit polls seem to indicate a lot of people feel the effects of inflation and aren’t happy with Biden, and therefore Harris. 

>Forty percent of Georgia voters rate the economy as the most important issue in their vote, tops among five issues tested and more than the 31% who say so nationally. That’s driven in part by the 52% who say they’re worse off financially than four years ago, up considerably from just 16% in 2020 and surpassing a previous high of 33% in available exit polls since 1992. About three-quarters (73%) say the national economy is in not so good or poor shape, surpassing the 67% who say so nationally.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

I mean. The rape allegations alone, without even hearing what he stands for.. should be enough. But they all go, “well he was never convicted”. 

Then I go, “it took how many decades for Epstein, ex best friend, to be convicted? You realize the power of money, right? That’s just guilty or innocent  in the eyes of the law. You can be a rapist and come out innocent”.

"Unfortunately, and sagaciously, the following is precisely relevant regarding those lost & sanctimoniously delusional individuals….

“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”

I think the picture the polls are painting is deceptive and that things aren't, in fact, as close as they make it out to be. Between the flood coming out from places like Tralfagar and AtlasIntel in the last couple weeks and the fact that they missed the post-Dobbs turnout in 2022 and still talk about the 'Trump bump' and barely not at all about Dems overperforming literally everywhere abortion has been to the forefront of the political issues since the overturning of Roe v Wade... There's room to be a little hopeful. Not *overconfident* - but hope is important, still.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

That is awesome. To bad on this front Swift was useless… especially for someone that wants to empower and support women. One little statement,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"There isn’t a single celebrity that I can think of that makes me think they aren’t completely selfish and think mostly about what’s best for them. So them telling me to vote a certain way just makes me think that that way is just going to lead to them making more money somehow, and one of the things I want least is for celebrities to make more money. ",2024_11_06,05_05_54

She did make one small lyric change at the last show to say “my body my choice”, but seeing how much effort the younger girls like Olivia and Billie have been putting into being  politically engaged, I honestly thought she would do at least a little more.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"My wife and I were in Detroit this weekend. We watched the Red Wings and former Kings goaltender Cam Talbot beat the Sabres on Saturday night, had late night Coney Dogs at American Coney, visited the Detroit Institute of Art on Sunday, and while walking around the downtown area around 4pm Sunday (and appreciating how unlike downtown L.A. it was), a bus pulled up with a large ""Harris for President"" mural on the side, and as it stopped and the door opened, a small crowd of pedestrians gathered around.

It was *not* Harris on board, but the lady that jumped out still appeared to be a very well liked politician, as one member of the crowd greeted her loudly and warmly with ""What up, dawg?!"" and she responded in kind, equally loudly and warmly.

After we'd passed through the crowd and emerged from the other side, my wife commented on what I had been feeling, the palpable, intense and positive energy emanating from the crowd.

""I've *never* felt anything like that,"" she said. And we've been at Southern Cross Station when a game let out and \~50,000 football fans descended on the platforms. That had nothing on this Sunday's experience.

This wasn't even President Harris, this was ""*just*"" for a local politician, but the atmosphere was *incredibly* positive.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"From a [Micheal Moore Essay](https://www.michaelmoore.com/p/dear-donald-a-dear-john-letter-to?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share) 

Are you that BIG A LOSER? Are you the biggest loser, Donald? I talked to all the historians at the Wharton School and at MIT and they’ve never seen anything like it. No one has ever tried to steal three elections in a row. At least George W. Bush was able to actually win one. 

Donald, are you a bigger loser than George W. Bush?

You lost your first election by three million votes. Americans don’t like you, Donald. 

Then you lost your second election by 10 million votes. You always say you got more votes than any sitting president ever, and yet… you still lost by 10 million votes. That’s how much people don’t like you.

Donald, you can do math can’t you? In 2020, seven million people liked Joe Biden more than you! Another 3 million, given the choice between Biden and You, chose ANYONE ELSE. That’s 84 million Americans, Donald, who voted against you. 84 Million! No sitting President has ever had that many people vote against him, Donald. No one.

Just you. 

Let me put it another way for you, Don. In 2016, there were 65 million people who voted against you. Four years later, it was 84 million people! That’s 19 million more people the second time! They weren’t illegal, Donald. They weren’t “made up” votes. It wasn’t “voter fraud.” It was non-voters! They saw what you did for 4 years in the White House and they said to themselves, “Fuck this guy!” And they stopped being non-voters. And they voted AGAINST you. That’s what happened.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Even thought many of them who participate in polls may be saying they will vote, I’m not sure all of them are actually going to show up this time, just because of how disastrous his campaign has been this cycle. So, I’m guessing that the outcome is going to be way off from what most of the polling was telling us about his supporters. Frankly  I think a lot of people who were saying they would vote for him only wanted to commit for the sake of it, even if they never intended to actually vote in the first place.

His campaign this time around took the rhetoric of 2020 and turned it up to 100. It's so much more blatantly misogynistic, xenophobic, angry and racist. 

I just can't believe he has grown support among anyone outside of *maybe* white men, which won't be enough.

Harris' campaign on the other hand has been nearly flawless on messaging and has been much stronger than Biden's across all demographics in 2020. If she increases turnout we might see a blowout. Worse case if she matches Biden's, it will be a slim victory.

Like I feel like he's more than likely *lost* support, especially women who may vote behind closed doors. (But otherwise in polls say they are voting with their husbands) This was also *before* January 6, (which I know was the final straw for many) before the convictions, etc. I don't see how that *helps* grow his base.

There's the die hard ""I'm voting for the felon,"" but there's nothing that would change their mind.

"In essence, nothing. There were all of these predictions leading up to the 2020 election that kept building up to something major. The four years of nothing during his presidency were finally about to pay off! And it spread outside of Q to these other groups all jumping in with predictions of their own about ""the storm"" and ""waking the kraken"" and everything else. Trump was going to win by a landslide and start rounding up the deep state and satanic pedophiles in government. It was going to be literally everything his followers fantasized about - and more!

Then Biden won the election. But of course that was just a ruse to lure all of the democrats to DC where a secret military force loyal to Trump (who actually won) would arrest them and try them all in military courts. There were going to be mass executions and everything. Then the inauguration happened and there was no mass arrest and Biden was sworn in as president. So the date was moved further into the future and soon Trump would reveal himself as the real president. But that date came and went as well. And another date. And another one. There were predictions about all of the various court cases contesting the election results, and all of them fell flat. People were finally starting to get tired of the constant stream of predictions being wrong and it was getting harder and harder for them to just say ""Trust the plan"" when literally nothing was going their way. I think the final nail in the coffin was when Q jumped the shark and predicted JFK Jr was going to come back from the dead and reveal himself as a Trump supporter and Trump's new Vice President. Most of the remaining Q supporters gave up at this point, and the few who didn't were thoroughly mocked by the media when they actually showed up in Dallas waiting for the big reveal.

I honestly don't know if Q kept making predictions after this point because that was effectively the end of anyone caring or talking about it. There were a few different groups and documentaries around this time that claimed to have figured out the identify of the person/people behind Q but I don't know if there was ever 100% confirmation.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"As a European, I can’t vote in the U.S. elections, but I can tell you this: your vote matters more than you might think, not just for America, but for the whole world. Here’s why:

1.	⁠⁠Global Impact: U.S. decisions on climate change, international trade, and global security affect everyone. Your vote influences policies that ripple far beyond American borders.
2.	⁠⁠Stand Up for Democratic Values: Voting is a powerful way to shape and protect democracy. In a world facing challenges to freedom and rights, every voice for fair representation matters.
3.	⁠⁠Address Shared Issues: From healthcare and education to climate action, many of the issues at stake in the U.S. elections are universal. Your vote impacts progress on these critical fronts.

So if you’re eligible, please vote today! You’re not only choosing leaders for the U.S.; you’re helping shape a world many of us believe in and support. Make your voice heard—today counts!",2024_11_06,05_05_54

If my memory serves me correctly, they literally drove into the city in a vehicle covered in Q-Anon bullshit. Those are the type of people he's speaking to here.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Provide proof of the claim that you allege they are blind to. 

Here's a friendly reminder of how Trump's election fraud cases went for him last time around...  

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trumps-challenges-2020-election-unfolded-courtroom-rcna175490

> After Donald Trump claimed victory in the early-morning hours after election night in 2020, his campaign and supporters turned to the courts to make that claim a reality. The Trump campaign and surrogates began filing lawsuits the very same day, challenging the results on a variety of grounds well before the final votes were counted.
> 
> The legal process and tactics may provide insight into how Trump or his allies could launch similar efforts should he lose again this time.
> 
> Over the remainder of November and into December, Trump and his Republican allies filed dozens of lawsuits in key swing states that, if successful, would have given Trump the Electoral College votes needed to remain in the White House. Their efforts stretched from local county courts all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and were supported by solo practitioners and state attorneys general alike.
> 
> Of the more than 60 lawsuits filed in the post-election period, Trump obtained a favorable ruling in only one case — the remainder were eventually either dismissed, settled or voluntarily withdrawn.  

Not to mention how poorly it went for his attorneys...  

https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/trump-lawyer-cases-show-2020-election-punishments-come-slowly 
 
> Here’s a rundown of some of the most notable cases state lawyer organizations and courts are pursuing:  
> 
> **Jeffrey Clark**
> 
> A DC Bar committee on April 4 preliminarily found Clark violated at least one ethics rule by lying about alleged election fraud. The panel will decide as early as next month before sending the matter to the Board on Professional Responsibility. The case then goes to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
> 
> The bar’s DC disciplinary counsel, Hamilton “Phil” Fox, is seeking Clark’s disbarment. The bar bodies and the appeals court could decide on lesser sanctions, such as a written warning.  
> 
> **John Eastman**
> 
> A California State Bar Court judge on March 27 said Eastman should be disbarred for knowingly making false statements that election irregularities cost Trump the 2020 race.
> 
> The bar court’s appellate division will review the finding, and the state’s highest court will ultimately decide. Eastman has said he could seek US Supreme Court review.
> 
> Though Eastman has yet to be disbarred, he is ineligible to practice law in California, according to his online law license. Eastman challenged his “inactive” law license status on April 3. The State Bar argued on April 10 that Eastman needs to be sidelined because he has shown he is willing “to misrepresent facts, violate the law, and pursue frivolous claims on behalf of clients.”  
> 
> **Rudy Giuliani**
> 
> New York’s Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in June 2021 temporarily suspended Giuliani’s law license for making false, misleading statements about the election. A Democratic state senator had filed a complaint with the state’s Attorney Grievance Committee, which sought the suspension.
> 
> The District of Columbia Court of Appeals followed, temporarily suspending Giuliani’s license in July 2021.
> 
> A DC Bar committee in July 2023 recommended Guliani’s disbarment for his failed election challenge in Pennsylvania. The bar’s Board on Professional Responsibility held a hearing in November. The board’s report could be issued at any time.
> 
> After the board makes its finding, the case goes to the DC Court of Appeals.  
> 
> **Sidney Powell**
> 
> The Michigan Attorney Grievance Commission in May 2023 filed a complaint claiming Powell and other lawyers brought frivolous election challenges in the state. A hearing panel of the Michigan Attorney Discipline Board in December rejected Powell’s arguments that the board lacks jurisdiction.
> 
> In 2021, a US district judge in Detroit fined Powell and other attorneys more than $175,000 in 2021 for wasting resources by filing a lawsuit to overturn the election result in Michigan. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit largely upheld the sanctions in 2023, and the US Supreme Court in February declined to hear a challenge of the appeals court decision.
> 
> In Texas, the Texas Commission for Lawyer Discipline last year said it is taking its ethics case against Powell to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas. A federal judge in Texas in February 2023 threw out discipline charges that alleged Powell had violated legal ethics rules. 
>

"Emperor Norton made 'proclamations' supporting church-state separation and opposed state Sunday laws.

He supported women's right to vote.

He believed in the right of the people to fair taxes and basic services (such as well-maintained streets and public transportation). He supported technological innovations that improved public welfare.

He issued two proclamations, in 1869 and 1876, calling for the dissolution of the Democratic and Republican parties.

He issued decrees calling for the construction of a bridge or tunnel to connect Oakland and San Francisco. These decrees were prescient, as the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube were eventually built. 

And In 1872, he issued a decree that levied a $25 penalty on anyone who used the nickname ""Frisco"" (I firmly agree with this).

">Initial funeral arrangements were for a pauper's coffin of simple redwood. However, members of a San Francisco businessmen's association, the Pacific Club, established a funeral fund that provided for a handsome rosewood casket and arranged a dignified farewell. Norton's funeral on Saturday, January 10, was solemn, mournful, and large. Paying their respects were members of ""all classes from capitalists to the pauper, the clergyman to the pickpocket, well-dressed ladies and those whose garb and bearing hinted of the social outcast"". The next day, the *San Francisco Chronicle* reported, under the headline ""Le Roi Est Mort,"" that some 10,000 people had come to view the emperor's body in advance of the 2 p.m. funeral.

He also has no fucking clue what it even is, I'm sure.  I've yet to hear anyone actually directly ask him what, exactly, he believed that Roe v.

"That's pretty much a textbook dictator flaw:

>His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His ""unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,"" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Weißem und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.

>There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaos—and it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.

>**Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.**

>He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as ""the greatest actor in Europe,"" and wrote to a friend, ""I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history."" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish—he would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat ""prodigious amounts of cake"" and ""put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.""

>He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.

>Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a ""half-mad rascal"" or a ""man with a beery vocal organ."" In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.

>Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

The courts are the only reason we aren’t one of the states seeing women dying for lack of care, our governors have actually appointed serious judges who care about our rights, and Cox has stood up for queer kids.  We were one of the first states to have gay marriage and have a very functional relationship between the LDS church and gay activists that in a better world would be a model for the Republican party.  

Not always a lot to go on so I feel compelled to reward them with support when they have little bit of courage and integrity.  Anytime the crazies try to go after the nomination it’s terrifying, and once it ended up with Mike Lee in the Senate.  My rep for a long time was Jason Chafetz.  We’re on a knife’s edge between decent sincere conservatives and the absolute worst people alive.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

His family, noticeably absent in this campaign, are likely considering whether or not to rat him out to prosecutors in order to save their skins.

"A mostly on-point, albeit inherently national media sane-washed, summation of Donald Trump’s 714-day coast-to-coast Stay Out Of Jail tour (formally, his 2024 presidential campaign, announced Nov. 22, 2022)

> Over the course of the 2024 contest, Trump railed against undocumented immigrants, standing on a debate stage and falsely accusing Haitian migrants of stealing and eating their neighbors’ cats and dogs. He mocked Biden for being old and mentally infirm, and he repeatedly mispronounced Harris’s name and insulted her intelligence. At times, he echoed rhetoric from Nazi Germany and, more recently, falsely declared himself “the father of IVF” and promised to protect women, “whether the women like it or not.”

> A week ago Sunday, at what was supposed to be his triumphant Madison Square Garden rally in a city that had never fully accepted him, Trump’s speech was overshadowed by a comedian who appeared before him and described Puerto Rico as “a floating island of garbage.” Trump was livid, saying the comment — and ensuing days of negative headlines — was an unforced error in the final days, two people close to him said.

> Yet for much of the campaign, Trump offered a message of xenophobia and misogyny and racism, of cruelty and darkness and hate. If he wins, it will be because enough of the nation embraced that message, too. And if he loses, it will be because enough of the nation voted against that message — and Trump himself.

> About a dozen Donald Trump campaign aides spoke to Tim Alberta, a staff writer at The Atlantic, about how their candidate strayed from a hitherto on-message campaign to embark on a series of offensive, threatening and self-defeating verbal adventures that have left his team utterly demoralized heading into Election Day.

> The takeaway from his conversations, he said, was that the fall campaign had &quot;Been a total train wreck of a fall campaign for the Trump folks.""

> Even as polls edged back in favor of Trump by late October, any momentum was seemingly snuffed out by right-wing comedian Tony Hinchcliffe opening a Trump rally in New York by calling Puerto Rico an &quot;Island of garbage.""

"The Conservative subreddit s somehow saying he ran a historically good race and is applauding him. Within virtually the last week this man…

-Fellated a microphone.

-Referenced his lowest political moment (the Access Hollywood tape) in a speech. Needlessly reminding everyone what a rapey douchebag he is.

-Called Nancy Pelosci and Michelle Obama a bitch.

-Said he wouldn’t mind if someone shot the reporters and media crew at his rally.

-Felt the need to ensure everyone he had never read Mein Kamph. (It’s ok, we know Donald. We have tape of your best friend for 10 years Jeffery Epstein saying you are functionally illiterate.)

-Declared voter fraud without evidence again.

-Tried to own Biden calling him garbage by failing miserably to open a garbage truck door, simultaneously displaying his age, stupidity and incompetence.

It was a historic campaign. The worst campaign in US presidential history and the results will show it. Don’t be surprised when his reasoning for the eLeCtIoN bEiNg sToLeN is that some polls showed him leading or at least close when the reality is that it will be a total blowout in Harris’s favor.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"The *only* topic he managed to touch on that had *any* meaning to actual voters is the immigration issue. To say that there remains a significant problem with illegal entry and illegal overstays isn't inherently wrong. This problem does exist, and even Harris' campaign  has acknowledged it. 

But Trump's problem was a) not mentioning that *he* was the reason Congress didn't pass the immigration bill that would have addressed this issue, and b) he chose to frame it as ""ALL those brown immigrants you see are evil dog-eating illegals and I'm going to DEPORT THEM ALL!!!1!"" which, I believe, alienated more voters than it gained.

In literally every other topic, he bombed spectacularly, or didn't address at all. He spent much of his time ""weaving"" stories about fictional serial killers or bitching about microphones. None of this was helpful, and none of this could have gained any more voters than turned out for him in 2020 when he was the incumbent.

Trump is not running a normal campaign, and he’s not going to be judged as if he’s running one. His campaign is abhorrent, but he’s running it very well. He needs his supporters to feel heard, to feel angry, and to feel empowered. He needs to come across as irreverent, as disrespectful, and as a transgressive antihero.

I would agree he's cynically made no effort to put forward a platform. He has no ideas. He's lazily and impulsively taken to his podium and rambled aimlessly with low energy for months and months. His ramblings center on his own ego and id, as they always have. He's insulted and threatened people, public and private. He's disgraced himself, which has become all too normal and accepted for his campaigns. 

Worst in history. Yes. Somehow trumping his own ugly, deranged performances in the past. 

But you're giving her a little too much credit. Kamala has applied herself competently. She's avoided gaffes. She's pulled together policy agendas in relatively short time in reaction to being handed the baton mid-season. All that is commendable.

However, that's not the best campaign in history. You're getting carried away. 

Obama was quite a bit more effective at winning hearts and minds. He didn't have the benefit of his opponent being the most repugnant human being on earth. He hadn't been VP for 4 years. He was the underdog and rose meteorically because of his rhetorical skill, his agreeable, common sense and sensible persona, and a massively innovative campaign leveraging the internet (during the onset of Web 2.0 days) in unprecedented ways, basically writing a new playbook for every political campaign of the following 18 years. His team combined data science and grassroots mobilization and globally recognizable branding to get our first African American president elected. He was a fucking rock star.

Kamala hasn't come anywhere close to that. She's borrowed some of those moves, which have been refined over almost 2 decades, and she's wisely followed his lead in approaching controversial issues with caution and consideration. But she has barely broken through all the noise Trump creates. She's going to be a great President (assuming the country doesn't fuck this up) but she's largely being propelled by people's hatred of Trump because even though she has made the effort to explain what she stands for, most people don't feel like they've heard her. And that's not the best campaign ever. It's unique due to circumstances, but it's not superlative.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

The Atlantic article really details what his campaign was like after Biden dropped out is very telling. Trump could not remain disciplined for the entire campaign. I think when Joe dropped out of the race it literally broke Trumps mind. He could not understand why Biden dropped out and that it had to be some sort of coup. He will never understand it because he doesn't understand self sacrifice for the greater good. I think after that Trump wanted to lash out and that is why he brought back Kelly Anne Conway and Corey Lewandowski. These are two people that will never say no to him and be yes people to all his dumb ideas. I'm positive his stupid fake Taylor Swift endorsement was given the thumbs up by Lewandowski and it Wiles had no idea it was happening until it was on Twitter. I'm sure instances like this happened several times a day in his campaign.,2024_11_06,05_05_54

Hawley and Cruz were definitely both trying to angle January 6th into their moments to stand up and appeal to the base, but after Trump literally incited an insurrection, they both just fell flat on their faces. To Cruz' defense, he's very used to that.

Once that failed, and Trump remained, they FOR SOME REASON, let DeSantis run against him. I have no idea why DeSantis did this, clearly Trump was the front runner, there's no way he wasn't taking the primaries, and DeSantis was supposedly their 'ace in the hole' and not just did he lose to Trump, he looked like an absolute buffoon while doing it.

However, even if we see another close race, the GOP stuck with Trump because it kept looking like he was their best chance to win. If he loses 2 elections that looked very winnable, one of which with the unprecedented note of losing to a candidate that replaced an incumbent president mid election, there’d have to at least be some reflection at the top level of the party about whether or not this strategy is sustainable especially with possible factors like Trump falling further behind with the popular vote and likely just being too old to run himself. Can it even work without Trump, because the GOP primaries seem to say otherwise this year. It’s why I’ve always thought they’d run into real problems anyway when Trump was gone.

Maybe they ultimately do settle on tyring Trump without Trump but I’d still expect discussions second guessing it before the decision is made.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Wade or Jan. 6, but rather trans people in general, and their inclusion in sports.

He is not a full blown MAGA, but he is a party-over-country Republican who has flip flopped his views based on whatever the talking point of the party becomes. I liken him more to a Mitch McConnell type than a Trumper type. However, he still voted for Trump twice because, in his words, Trump ""best represents my values"".

What he doesn't understand is that me distancing myself from him isn't because he's a Republican. It's because at this point, the difference between Democrats and Republicans isn't one of politics, it's one of decency, values, and morality. It shows me what kind of person you are. And a person like that is not someone who I want to be friends with.

"I want to share a story about Jon Tester, and part of the reason I've voted for him for over a decade.

When I got out of the Marines, I went to UM on the GI Bill.

The money didn't come for tuition/stipends etc. I was a young former E-4, newly married. We were barely covering expenses and borrowing money from family. I considered dropping out.

As late October approached, I was getting desperate. My wife was pregnant and we were scraping by. The VA was not helpful at all. I'd wait for 3-4 hours on hold just to be dropped or be told their hands were tied. The campus VA was sympathetic but couldn't do anything, either.

I ended up emailing all my local/state representatives and Senators.  One of them, the only one to respond, forwarded the message to Tester's office.

One day later, I was in Tester's Missoula office with *his chief of staff* in the closing days of an election year.

She took down all my info, thanked me for my service, and Tester had a congressional inquiry filed that afternoon.

That was a Friday--I had my money on Monday. 


This is just an anecdote, and it seems small, but this guy's team sat down with a random 22 year old kid in the heat of an election and solved my issue with compassion and quick action. Right through all the red tape.

I'll never forget that of all the people I asked for help, it was a local Democrat and Senator Tester's office *alone* who reached out and helped me.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"We better put in some fucking work if we get control of the presidency, house, and Senate. There's so many things that need to be addressed to improve the lives of Americans, Dems better take full advantage in that situation.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
">It found Tester four percentage points ahead of Sheehy, according to Leuchtman, who did not release the full poll results (his firm does privately commissioned polling), just within the survey’s 4.97 percent margin of error.

"Don’t forget we have also have abortion rights on the ballot to help push turnout in his favor. And anecdotally, the ground game for the Tester campaign has been blowing Sheehy’s out of the water and I’m in the reddest of the cities here.

From talking to my very Republican family they’re not that enthusiastic about Sheehy or against Tester; it’s mostly come down to shrugs and “well, Sheehy has an R next to his name so I guess I’ll pick him.” 

I don’t think Tester winning is a certainty but I have  hope he can pull it off. He’s never had an easy race or comfortable polling.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

It makes no goddamn sense whatsoever. First of all, why would they think you shot yourself if there wasn't the sound of a gun firing, if there wasn't the sound of a gun firing they wouldn't have issued a citation for discharge of a weapon in a park...there would also be medical records but he says there are none.

"Universal health care would fix so many issues with our country it’s wild. 

-	to start it forces people who want to retire to work for no reason. Causing a strain on jobs.  Or keeping people stuck in jobs because they get a good plan for their family. 
-	it greatly hurts unions as they need to bargain for it. They could only bargain for money and time off. 
-	it forces companies to hire part time workers. No more benefits for companies means they want full time workers doing 40 hours a week. 
-	people can get mental care they need and get rid of alot of shootings and people on the streets. 
-	people can get drug treatments and get users clean and in rehab facilities. 
-	far less bankruptcies . People with or without insurance claim medical debt as the main reason for filing. 
-	so so so much preventative care. No more waiting until things get really bad before going to the doctor. Same goes for helping those who need surgeries get it.

The big one is going to be proper pay to fix this shit. So many large companies abuse employees with them needing to bargain for medical care. With that off the book then it’s just money and time off. Which makes them at a far larger disadvantage.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

I'm also guessing T might be underperforming on LPVs, and the ones he turned did so through mailed in ballots as instructed by their overlords this cycle. Took polling a while to spot the cannibalization as it's a behavioral pattern shift.

We'll see. I'm sure if it is a polling error, the media will give us narratives on either a ""last week shift"" and/or ""quiet women voters"" but this might be just be a simple Trump jumped the shark in the rural/exurbs counties and the polling industry failed to figure it out.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

They're going to be posting what people want to click on, and the strategy is usually either to cast a wide net or just cast multiple nets saying different (sometimes directly opposed) things. Clicks clicks clicks, that's literally it.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

It’d be fascinating to see the evolution of polling techniques over the last 25 years.  My hunch (speculation) is that current polling involves a lot less direct communication with voters and a lot more screen time and juggling of questionable data and assumptions.,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"Nate Silver also commented that even in a truly tied race, you would only expect around 68% of polls with regular sample sizes to be in the +-3 points range for either Harris or Trump, but he observed that well over 80% of polls is within that range. So it is practically guaranteed that they are moving the outcomes closer to 50/50 than what they observe. But the fact that after Selzer they dare to show some positive results for Harris also says little, maybe more Trump-positive results remain hidden. Best to assume we really don't know what polling says at the moment.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"I suspect what we're seeing most of all is the mass-gamification of polling, forecasts, and betting markets.

Prior to 2008, polls and forecasts weren't a part of the popular consciousness. They were for political wonks and nerds and a handful of journalists.

Then ol' Nate Silver comes 'round and grabs a pot and dumps some polls and some statistics in to it and sprinkles in some pretty graphs for flavor and it *takes off*, because internet nerds have some pretty clickies to browse all day long in the lead-up to the election and reading the stuff he puts together makes them feel smart.

2012 is still mostly Nate Silver's game but now randos are starting to talk about it too and big publications like New York TImes wants a piece of the action.

By 2016, there are now multiple competitors and forecasts have become *part of the political process*. 2016 does 2016 things of course and a few dozen bloggers get a tidal wave of clicks by writing up ""what went wrong in 2016"" articles, but the one thing that *doesn't* happen is people stop following polls and forecasts. A few nerds, like me, have the massively unpopular opinion that, maybe, these forecasts are actually a bit harmful to the political process, but the slobbering masses are too desperate to know what's gonna happen before it happens to hear it.

By 2020, polls, forecasts, and betting markets have become fully gamified, and now in 2024 we're experiencing it like people are suddenly experiencing climate change for the first time. Everyone's confused, everyone's like, ""wait, why is this all so weird this year?"".

In like 80% of discussions about the US presidential election over the last three months especially you'll find *someone* saying something along the lines of, ""welp, guess I better make a wager over on (a betting market)"". People are discussing *the names and reputations of pollsters and forecasters now*, and *that* behavior is indistinguishable from everybody in suburbia buying an investment property in 2007.

Now we're cheering on individual polls like they're the same team sports as political races.

And so yeah, when things get gamified, game theory rolls up to make everything go sideways and upside-down. Hooray.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

The problem is most good journalism these days comes from sites with a paywall, because a subscriber-based model incentivizes writing stories that your subscribers will remember as quality when it comes time to renew, while a click-based model incentivizes clickbait. I don’t know how a subreddit handles that, but as an individual, I highly recommend subscribing to an outlet that you find consistently good (not perfect, none of them are perfect).",2024_11_06,05_05_54

I spent my first 6 months diving into the data to really get a handle of everything, ultimately making the case how there's a lot of correlation on topline metrics, but when you start digging in, the correlation doesn't hold up.

Everything I said was just dismissed. It was very frustrating. But I realized that the people in charge had about 30 years of inertia on their side and they weren't willing to stick their necks out to do something different. If we stopped doing things that they could historically take credit for being successful, and instead did other things that ended up not appearing successful, it would hurt their career. And if we ended up being more successful, but the explanation included no longer doing things that they historically touted as being successful, that would also portray them in a negative light.

"If I remember correctly, (don’t quote me) you have to notify the SEC at least 2 business days *before* selling shares, because you are considered “insiders”. This is specifically to prevent pump and dumps like the above commenters believe to be happening. Which from my investment experience, big wigs like directors and CEOs typically make big insider sales for tax purposes, not because they are getting out or the company is tanking. 

Contextually speaking, to add some validity to my case, you can actually check on [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/djt) to see the short interest for Trumps stock. Over an hour ago maybe around the time of the article, there were 0 shares available to short. What that means is, institutions borrowed every single share that was available to be borrowed, and sold them, because their outlook is that trump will lose the election resulting in his stock price crashing. So when they buy back the shares at a much lower price than when they sold, they pay what is owe and collect the difference. 

There is absolutely no fucking way in ANY parallel that trump is stupid enough to try and sell his shares the day of the election. He would have had to at the *LATEST*, inform the SEC on Friday, that he would be dumping shares today. Imagine if he fucking did that lmao.

">So due to the cultural construct of whiteness, you get Cuban-Americans sometimes being starkly reminded that they aren't fully part of the system due to their last name, even if they might otherwise ""pass"" and get the advantages of being whiteness. 

Pretty much. If you're a white Hispanic, they just won't consider you white. Even if they do, it doesn't mean you'll be treated equally. White nationalists simultaneously believe race is an objective biological thing that exists *and* that if you have blonde hair and blue eyes but your last name is Rodriguez or Goldstein then you're not actually white. Racists themselves are the biggest proof that race is a social construct and not something biological.

>What really drives me nuts about this is conservative Catholics who don't realize that if Christian Nationalists ever win, they are all in serious danger.

Mainstream Christian nationalism in the U.S. tends to be somewhat inclusive of Catholics. After all, many of the prominent figures - Kevin Roberts, JD Vance, Nick Fuentes, John McEntee, etc. - are Catholic. Heck, Peter Thiel and Elon Musks are atheists and part of that movement. 

But it's a temporary and convenient alliance: if they get power, they're gonna set their sights on Catholics, Mormons, Orthodox, any liberal Protestant churches, etc. Latinos are often stuck in a Catholic bubble (language barrier doesn't help) and often don't know that a lot of Evangelical Protestants really hate Catholics.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"I think a lot of white folks in the U.S. define ""white"" in their head as people who look vaguely Nordic (so basically northern and eastern Europeans). If you look vaguely Mediterranean, they just don't consider you white, even if you're pale. I'm not pale but I'm not tan either, but my hair and eyes are dark brown, I can grow a prickly dense beard, I have a hairy body, and my eyes and nose shape are typical of a Spaniard or Italian (I basically look like a slightly chubby Maluma without tattoos, down to the skin tone and everything).

I work at a retail home improvement store and we don't have uniforms, so we can wear whatever we want (except jewelry when we operate machines). On days where I dress like a ""white"" person (black tee and beige cargos), the Latino customers either ask me questions first in English because they think I'm not Latino, or ask me if I know Spanish because they have a hunch I might be one but they're not sure. If they don't know English, they ask for a translator, and that's when I surprise them with Spanish.

On days where I dress more stereotypically Latino (baggy blue jeans, white Nike basketball shoes, earrings, thin gold chain and a watch), like 95% of the time the Latino customers immediately ask me questions in Spanish. They just know. In recent years I've been dressing more like this basically as a response to MAGA (I also just like the style) and to signal to other Latinos that I'm one of them and that they can talk to me in Spanish.

I'll tell you this: when I was in K-12, I never perceived myself as being the same race as the blonde/ginger white kids. After all, those kids insisted I wasn't white, and Latinos themselves use ""blanco"" to mean northern Europeans when talking in an American context (in a Latin American context, I would be considered *blanco* by other Latinos, but I suddenly become *not* white when in an American context). So I didn't perceive myself as white because all the cultural messaging I was getting was telling me I wasn't. I perceived myself as Hispanic and nothing else. When I first played Skyrim, I selected Imperial rather than Nord. The cultural messaging runs deep.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"""Whiteness"" is really a deliberate construction of not-black.  We created a caste system to convince poor ""whites"" that their interests were not aligned with poor blacks, to bolster slavery, Jim Crow, and other kinds of anti-black discrimination.

"Depends on where you were. White/Black dominates the South and a fair bit of the North. So Native and Asian heritage mostly got overlooked (Chang Bunker and Eng Bunker, the famous conjoined twins, were considered white in North Carolina, and married white women and owned slaves). Mixed race people might pass themselves off as Native to get around the social and legal restrictions of being black.

But out west, Latino, Asian and Native heritage mattered a lot more, like in NE when large Irish populations started to come, or the Mid Atlantic with Italians. 

You can see how narrow whiteness was to some by literature. An insane example is the poem ""*Providence in 2000 A.D*"" by HP Lovecraft, which shows his bigoted view on what is white is very limited, with French and Swedes among the many groups he sneers at it.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Pennsylvania to the rescue. Harris 💙💙💙💙,2024_11_06,05_05_54
Voter turnout is amazing! Great job everyone! But don't forget that massive lines is just voter suppression by the right. They didn't have to have fewer polling places. They don't have to have slower mail services or on-fire drop boxes. This is what voter suppression looks like. Please don't get lazy. They expect you to. They expect you to leave and assume that other's will be enough. They want you to go home. Please don't. Your voice matters and your vote makes a difference. We just had a provincial vote here in BC Canada. The number of votes in some districts deciding the winner was less than 100. In some places less than 30 votes! You're doing good.

PA already had a big democrat lead in mail-ins (unsurprisingly) but we need to also see high turnout on Election Day. Since Election Day is traditionally where republicans close the gap in states with mail-ins.

There’s also the fact that Trump encouraged republicans to vote early this time, so that should have increased turnout for early voting for Rs and tipped the scales a little bit away from Election Day voting. So we might be seeing a slightly lower republican turnout today, but since we’re still seeing a high total turnout, it could very well be more democrats at the polls.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Article:

Former President Obama on Tuesday urged the country to be patient as election workers count ballots to determine the results of the election.

“It took several days to count every ballot in 2020, and it’s very likely we won’t know the outcome tonight either,” Obama wrote on the social platform X.

Obama encouraged the public to “keep a few things in mind as you make your voice heard today.”

First, he said to remember that “thousands of election workers around the country are working hard today,” adding, “Respect them. Thank them.”

“Don’t share things before checking your sources,” he added.

And finally, “Let the process run its course. It takes time to count every ballot.”

More than 82 million voters cast early ballots this year, which is slightly more than half the total turnout in the presidential election in 2020, according to The Associated Press.

States have different rules dictating when and how ballots must be counted. Some states have changed their rules since 2020, which could change the timing of when results come in.

In 2020, the race was not officially called for days after the election, leading experts to preemptively warn the public against expecting to know the results of the race on Tuesday night. Experts also warn that early poll returns do not necessarily indicate the trajectory of the entire election.

Vice President Harris and former President Trump are entering Election Day in what polls indicate could be the closest race in recent history.

According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling aggregate, Trump and Harris are tied nationally, with 48.4 percent support each.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

> &quot;Hellboy&quot; icon Ron Perlman recently appeared on SiriusXM&#039;s &quot;The Dean Obeidallah Show&quot; ahead of Election Day to praise Kamala Harris&#039; campaign as &quot;Pitch perfect.&quot; The actor has long been an outspoken critic of Donald Trump, and claimed the Republican nominee is &quot;Fucking terrified&quot; of Harris.

> &quot;Fucking Kamala Harris. She&#039;s the first one that has put [Trump] in his place to the point where he&#039;s so fucking terrified! He canceled all of his press, canceled all of his debate,&quot; Perlman said.

> Popular on Variety Perlman also praised Harris for choosing Tim Walz as her running mate, and he expressed enthusiasm for the way she immediately started targeting Trump when she replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee for president.

"""I think he's a brilliant businessman, and I think he knows how to use the media and manipulate it to his advantage... He is the consummate showman. I admire him for that."" 
~Ron Perlman (2011 interview from The Hollywood Reporter). 

Fast forward to 2016:

“F**k every last one of you who voted for this piece of sh*t.”



“He’s a good businessman. He’s a good promoter. He’s got a sense of how to sell himself. I respect that."" 
~Robert DeNiro (2011 interview from The Hollywood Reporter)

By 2018:
""Fk Trump! It’s no longer 'Down with Trump.' It’s 'Fk Trump!'""

What happened? 

Cancel culture gained momentum in 2016 and the #MeToo movement gained steam by 2017 as well as woke culture. 

So pre-2016 Perlman was largely singing his praise as was DeNiro, but by the time cancel culture took off, their rhetoric shifted to align with all the other individuals trying to keep cancel culture off their back. 

Before 2016 Trump was a well-regarded and well-respected business mogul. 

What happened?

Weinstein happened. 

In October 2016, just before the presidential election, a bombshell story about Harvey Weinstein’s long history of alleged sexual harassment was published by The New York Times. The article detailed years of allegations from women about Weinstein’s inappropriate behavior, which ranged from harassment to assaults.

Trump's remarks:

“I’ve known him for a long time. I’m not surprised to hear it. … I’ve known him for a long time. I’m not a fan of Harvey Weinstein, and I’ve been saying that for a long time. I was never a fan of his, I can tell you that.""

Weinstein was a major donor for Trump's political rival Hillary Clinton. 

Epstein happened:

The real estate rivalry between Trump and Epstein occurred in the early 2000's. 

Trump was attempting to sell a property in Palm Beach, and Epstein showed interest in buying it. However, the deal fell through. One of the reasons given for this was that Trump was unwilling to sell the property to Epstein after learning more about his activities and the kind of reputation Epstein had developed. This rejection led to a reported confrontation between the two men, and, in a turn of events, Palm Beach police were reportedly called when Epstein became upset.

I know this is very long but it's honestly totally crazy. Like right out of the movies. Trump is freaking vicious. The guy had a hand in strategically bringing down one of the most powerful moguls in Hollywood and even sacrificed himself to do it. Clinton's people release his locker room talk tape and the guy gets even. They all have dirt on each other, but he's a lot better at manipulation. Weinstein was ruined, eaten by his own people and guys like Perlman even said, (paraphrasing) ""Not all of use are equally guilty."" Ha, something to hide perhaps? 

So no, Trump is not afraid of Kamala IMO. Hollywood appears to be petrified of Trump.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"One thing I've always thought about Trump (as someone who despises him and what he stands for) is that he can't really be compared to anyone. Definitely not anyone in America's history, or most first world countries for that matter. The combination of circumstances that created his personality, created his career and image, and led to his election feels like some kind of black swan event.

This is why I don't get too upset at people being blindsided by his victory in 2016. How and why would you possibly prepare for a phenomenon like him?

Internationally, I feel like he has a lot in common with Berlusconi. He was also (seen as) a successful businessman, political outsider, populist, brash, ""impolite"" etc. I don't know that much about his political career but I'm aware of those basics.

You also have populists like Bolsonaro, and rogue soft authoritarians like Netanyahu and Erdogan where you could draw some comparisons, but many differences too.

If I'm taking a long view, I personally think and hope that history will remember him as a bizarre blip more than anything. Sort of like how Spain was randomly a fascist dictatorship for like 40 years, but a democracy before and after. Or how Oliver Cromwell overthrew the monarchy but then it was reinstated after him.

Tl;dr my take is that W and Reagan are more representative of our political system, and Trump is more of a bizarro detour.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

However, Trump might make a good result in term of popular votes, since his campaign since Biden withdrew has been all about mobilizing his base, so he might make good results (but not enough to win) in CA, NY and and other blue states, by getting the people who usually don't vote because it's pointless.

That is a very innocent way of putting it and almost downright deceptive....

Libertarians want to destroy and weaken the federal government to the point that it doesn't impact them. The Libertarians in America are closer to Fascism or Autocracy than any other party that gets talked about.

The Libertarian Establishment is entirely compromised at this point by Billionaires and Republicans it should always be treated as a republican proxy.

For a long time now the Republicans and Billionaires have scouted universities and recruited young libertarians to shill right wing politics and very little people seem to be aware. There is a reason both Peter Thiel and JD Vance had rich republican boyfriends that funded them in college and afterwards they immediately try to destroy the democracy. 

The issue is the true libertarians are more further right wing than the republicans. They actually want to destroy the united states where as the republicans just want to grift and enrich themselves and the billionaires.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

It makes more sense to me for someone to say ""this impacts me personally, and I'm going to vote for him anyway because I think these other things are more important, so I'm going to do what I think is right even though I'm putting myself at risk."" That's proverbially putting your money where your mouth is.

Maybe it's a generational thing. Maybe this new generation of men who made a whole category to feel sorry for themselves called ""incel"" don't actually understand manhood.

"Agreed. It boils my blood when I see the topic dismissed as “well just use birth control” or “don’t make choices if you aren’t prepared for the consequences”, because so many of these people only think of abortion as being something women are doing regularly in place of birth control. 

But something like one in three women are likely to experience a miscarriage in their lifetimes, and many of those require intervention for the health of the mother. 

In conservative terms, we, and many others, followed all their rules. We were married and wanted to have a child and all that. But something beyond our control went wrong. 

I am not saying all this to say that our situation is more valid than someone with an accidental pregnancy, I don’t think it’s anyone’s business but the patient and doctor.

We covered a lot of issues, but the one that really showed how futile it was was when we talked about the economy. My dad tried to say how the economy would do better under Trump and I pointed out that 26 Nobel laureates back Harris, none back Trump. He then said to me ""well why does my finance guy tell me Trump will be better for the economy?"" I told him to look back at the communications from 2020 because I'll bet that same finance guy said Biden would destroy the economy, yet the market gains have outpaced Trump. On top of that, he's been contemplating firing this finance guy for the last 3 years, but now all of a sudden we're just going to trust him blindly?

But even after all that, he was still steadfast on Trump and I just gave up. There wasn't a single issue he was able to hold a position on over the course of our 2 hour conversation.

"The irony about Mars, and all of Elon's fanboys thinking in their lifetimes they might be able to go live on some Martian colony (while having Elon's chips in their brains, despite many being anti-vax, lol) is that it'd be a nightmare:

Literally every movie, even the more critically acclaimed, ""The Martian"" (with Matt Damon) don't depict the fact that Mars only has *a bit under 1/3rd of Earth's gravity*, so in all those movies, people should be doing the goofy bouncy walking more similar to the astronauts we had on the Moon (but a little less extreme).

On top of that: radiation levels on the surface are *over a thousand times that on Earth*, and without terraforming the entire thing, which we're centuries, if not millenia away from technologically.

Finally: the temperature owing to its at most very thin atmosphere, is *at best* 70 degrees F during the day time at the equator, which while impressive it gets that warm, that far from the sun, *it drops down to -100+ F at night,* like a very extreme Earth desert, and it only gets worse the further from the equator you get.

So yeah, I don't doubt we might have a permanent small observatory, or a few, decades from now on Mars, similar to Antarctica now - but unless people would want to live years deep underground without natural light, bouncing around in low gravity, risking atrophy, etc., where low gravity likely makes human pregnancies impossible: living on Mars would be a total nightmare, lol.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Merchan didn't do that though. However he rationalizes it, he lent Trump a hand by repeatedly delaying his sentencing. The delays in sentencing were 100% political and work to Trump's benefit.

I agree with Judge Chutkan that the only way to treat Trump without being political is to treat him exactly the same as any other defendant would be treated. If Merchan had done that, Trump would have already been sentenced--though not necessarily to jail.

A typical white-collar defendant in a case like Trump's--old, no criminal record--would be likely to receive probation in NY. Trump himself is more of a wild card, because of all the crimes he's obviously committed, yet hasn't been proven guilty of in court. But by the same token, a typical defendant in Trump's situation would not be entitled to multiple adjournments of his sentencing. Maybe one, due to the appellate issue created by the US Supreme Court this past summer. But he should have been sentenced long ago despite that.

All that being said...if Merchan delayed his sentencing in order to watch how he conducts himself while free during the election...he may end up with a much more solid foundation to sentence Trump to prison. Merchan hasn't made any sort of promise, and can give Trump the max if he determines that Trump deserves it.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Even unfriendly airspace would have an incentive to force the plane to land - a pawn for political gain. If or when the plane needs to land for refueling, there’s no way the refueling service would do it. One, doing so would bring the ire of US law enforcement onto them, and two, Trump doesn’t pay.

It’s a fun game to think out. He is currently in Florida. Say he loses the election and wants to flee. He’ll fly to Alaska first. The plane will fly in Class A airspace and will need to file a flight plan. That’s a big old red flag. The plane will also need to file a flight path out of country.

So… that’s kinda sorta not a thing…? Like, countries will sign extradition treaties or not. The US has extradition treaties with countries, but I cannot find examples of a non-extradition treaty between the US and another party. Countries that do not have an extradition treaty with the US can still extradite someone back to the US, but don’t have too.

I cannot find an example of two countries who signed an agreement (treaty) to not extradite each other’s citizens. I’ll be happy to be corrected in this.

Anyways… whatever country that holds him that doesn’t have an extradition treaty will certainly hold a lot of power and have a strong position to negotiate certain request. Say he lands in Venezuela, well that government can ask for some, if not all, sanctions to be lifted in exchange, otherwise, they’ll turn over Trump to Russia, Iran, China, whoever will give them a better deal.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"From the WXIA-TV article:

""Over 4 million ballots were cast during early voting, with more than half of Georgia’s 7.2 million registered voters already participating. An additional 1 million votes are expected by the time polls close, marking another significant turnout for the Peach State.

Raffensperger, speaking at a press conference, emphasized efforts to enhance voter security and speed in reporting. Raffensperger noted that voters have experienced short wait times, with average check-in times under a minute. 

""It’s been smooth sailing by and large,"" he said. “Average line time in Georgia right now is two minutes.""

According to Senate Bill 189, which mandates reporting early and absentee ballots within one hour after polls close at 7 p.m., nearly all early votes should be in by 8 p.m., Raffensperger said. Smaller counties aim to finalize counts by 10:30 p.m., positioning Georgia to have a clearer election outcome than in past cycles.""",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Feel good about it. Our voting system is hardened against fuckery.

Through the day runners will come through to drop off supplies and get ""point"" reports about how many voters have voted based on the log maintained by the clerk at the polling site, making sure it lines up with the count of the machines. The log number should match the number across the machines. No one knows who voted for what at that point, just how many people have voted.

At the end of the night, at the polling place after voting concludes, each machine will print out multiple reports with the tallied results, one gets filed with the county, one with the state, one is posted publicly, and one is sent home with the minority inspector of elections (minority inspector is usually required to be from the opposite party as the judge of elections). Every report is signed off on by both inspectors, the judge, clerk, and all present machine operators.

Then the minority inspector and judge of elections take those reports, as well as the USB/media backing them up, as well as all ballots, to the county seat for tabulation, together (same vehicle if possible) to prevent tampering.

The county seat is where the counting actually happens and elected observers are present.

"FWIW, even with the law preventing the counting of mail-in ballots before the polls close, almost every Pennsylvania county-level election board is expecting to have results tallied and reported sometime tonight.

It's a dense damned county.

However, that one county is significant: without it, we likely can't be sure of the winner.  So PA probably won't be called until Philadelphia County is almost fully counted.  I think the only thing that will allow for an early calling of Pennsylvania is if there is a clear blue shift in non-Philly metro counties from 2020 to 2024.

Bush won Florida by 900 votes initially. Upon recount, he still won but only by 317 votes. A hand recount was ordered for 4 specific counties, as allowed by law. Specifically Gore requested a manual recount of 62,000 ballots where no presidential candidate was selected due to the ""hanging chads."" 

The Florida Secretary of State certified that Bush had won the election before the recounts were completed. Gore sued the Secretary of State and the Florida Supreme Court sided with Gore, allowing the recounts to finish. Bush appealed to the US Supreme Court and they immediately halted the recount. 

So not quite as clear cut as you portray it. A huge study concluded that Gore probably would have lost if they had completed the 4 county recount but probably would have won if they had done a statewide recount of untallied ballots.

Their model didn’t reflect the fact that if Trump outperformed the polls in PA, he would also probably be outperforming in MI, WI, etc.

For what it’s worth, FiveThirtyEight avoided this second problem by correctly assuming a fairly high covariance in errors across states. That’s why 538 gave Clinton only a 71% probability of winning. They noted going into Election Day that Trump was within a normal polling error of winning the thing, and, alas, that’s exactly what happened.

And I'm not being ""elitist"" here -- a person can travel in Europe on not much money, by backpacking, staying in youth hostels, etc. (that's what I did). (This may be true of Asia, Australia, and other areas as well, but I have no direct experience there.)


Some of them *really* don't understand that the entire world, aside from the other fascists/dictators, is *aghast* that we allowed trump into office the first time, much less that he is the Republican candidate now. Mostly they laugh at him, but they also know how stupid, demented, and fascist he is, and the untold damage he could inflict in the US and on the rest of the world. This is not only a US issue, it is a *planet-affecting* matter.


When a Democrat is in office, the US is afforded respect -- especially in the case of Obama, a highly intelligent, compassionate, well-spoken President. That we went from Obama to trump is a national shame, a national disgrace. We *will not* do it again.

Even if both sides ""are in the pockets of billionaires"", only one has staffed the FTC with people like Lina Khan, have pushed for regulations on corporations, have pushed for higher minimum wage, meanwhile the other side is pushing for deregulation and tax cuts and now tariffs(? seriously?) and that's only touching on a tiny layer of the economic aspect.

GLHF ever getting that. The issue with almost all polls is that Americans just don't fucking vote. Which is why it's kind of bollox to say ""half of Americans support Trump.""

The GOP illegally purged voter rolls in Democrat counties leading up to the election.

A county in Florida used an intentionally side-switching hole-punch ballot that flipped a lot of Gore votes. [Seriously, look for yourself.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida#/media/File:Butterfly_Ballot,_Florida_2000_(large\).jpg)

The GOP ""won"" Florida by 0.01% - about 500 votes.

Afterwards, the GOP fought against the legally mandatory recount and conducted riots. They selected counties where they found the recount would benefit Gore, and fought the recount there.

The GOP stole the election in 2000, and they got better at stealing elections since then. The thing about ~~voter~~ election fraud is the GOP made it legal.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"I also fell through the cracks at my small high school, my history teacher wanted to speed rush all of American history just so we could spend an entire semester covering Vietnam, which his father fought in, so he could bring in his dad to frighten us all with some gruesome horror stories.

I have a job which occasionally has me doing very repetitive tasks for a day or two a week, sometimes more, and so I like to listen to stuff.  The problem is that free resources like podcasts are very poorly sourced (like ultra popular Dan Carlin) or just really dry to listen to, but they got me hooked on wanting better history content. 

The best bang for my buck has been a Wondrium/Great Courses (for some reason they keep going back and forth on those names) subscription, you get history courses taught by actual professors, not just hobbyists like Carlin, and you can either watch the courses or just listen to them.  I’ve found the history ones are easy to just listen to, although sometimes I’ll switch to video on my phone to see a map or painting or what have you.  

The primary American history course on there is very extensive and exhaustive.  There are three main history lecturers on that one, the first of whom I enjoyed very immensely who covered from colonial America on through 1850 or so with a strong focus on American civics through that time.  I learned a lot about those presidents, some Supreme Court justices through that time, even prominent Speakers of the House, Senate majority leaders, etc.

The next lecturer covered basically from Buchanan (President just before Lincoln) on through the end of Reconstruction (1877 compromise I referenced above), and I liked him a lot but it was obviously very battle focused and the guy’s style was a bit jarring to me relative to the previous lecturer.  

I liked the last lecturer least of all, not that he was bad, it just really didn’t fit the rest of the lecture course narrative. He basically skipped over all presidents from 1877 on through Teddy, citing they were all mostly terrible presidents who aren’t worth paying attention to (and I was like that’s WHY I want to learn more about them! lol), but it was still some valuable big picture stuff where I learned a lot.  

That final lecturer did leave off with a very chilling note though, basically he mentioned that as a British person, he found the peaceful transition of power amongst administrations one of the best things about all of American history.  I had chills up my spine listening to that and being worried about what Trump was going to do should he lose.  For that reason alone (200+ years of peaceful power transitions, the hallmark of American democracy going back to Jefferson/Adams just cast aside by Trump), Donald J Trump is the worst president in history, in my opinion.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"I was reading a book about Reagan and FDR recently and the way that both of those men shaped our modern political landscape is astounding. Reagan in particular, everything about him screamed 'proto-Trump' it was uncanny. Immediately there's the obvious comparisons such as how they were both divorced despite campaigning on a religious platform or that Trump and Reagan were both celebrities turned politicians - though Trump's transition was much more dramatic - however their rhetoric also seems to be strikingly similar. I guess Reagan also severely leaned into this super-evangelical  'America is God's chosen land' rhetoric that's become disturbingly prominent with the GOP. Furthermore he also had the same 'just keep say things with enough confidence and it becomes reality' philosophy that Trump seems to have when giving a speech. I suppose that, like Trump, many of the anecdotes and facts Reagan would share in speeches were just patently false but because he said it with enough conviction his supporters would believe it. It also doesn't help that the political philosophy of both presidents is shaped by convincing American's that they're victims of high taxation, something which is bitterly ironic to anyone aware of taxation statistics. Finally, though a bit pedantic, I guess Reagan also believed in astrology meaning Trump was nowhere near the first time complete pseudoscience had entered the white house, though even then at the time it seems like conservatives had enough of a spine to criticize Reagan for this while nowadays conservatives celebrate Trump for believing conspiracy theories.

Obviously there's differences, Reagan for example at least demonstrated some level of competency and respectability that Trump seriously lacks, but the similarities are staggering.

If the demonstrations had been handled differently, or had been less violent, who knows, perhaps we would have avoided the entire Nixon debacle.

This is a really good example of why people who understand how to organize non violent protests need to teach the next generation the practical How to Do it's.  It's not all that easy, it's actually a skill set.  One violent act by one angry person in a demonstration become the excuse for a police riot.

>“The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people,” former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman told Harper’s writer Dan Baum for the April cover story published Tuesday.

>“You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,” Ehrlichman said. “We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”

">admitting they were wrong means coming to grips with the fact that they fell for racist/homophobic propaganda for decades

This is poor framing.  They didn't ""fall"" for anything, because this is how the nation *was*, as in ""it was common knowledge"" (that  ultimately was wrong).  Anybody liberal enough to take a modern perspective on AIDS for example, would have been so marginalized as to not be taken seriously.  You literally had Moral Majority groups (the forerunners of Christian Nationalists) saying gay men *deserved* to die from AIDS, and this wasn't *nearly* as unpopular of an idea back then as it would be today.  Even some non-trivial subset of the Democrats would have shrugged their shoulders if someone said that to their face.  People literally believed that homosexuality was a *rare* thing because very very few people were out of the closet.

Anybody born after about 1990 really can't grasp where society was with LGBTQ sensibilities before that time.  There were a tiny number of culturally significant people, like John Waters, who were willing to go ""I don't give a rip *what* society wants, I'm going to just be very open about this stuff that nobody wants to talk about, and I'm going to make movies and musicals about it,"" but he, and those like him, were seen as *subversive*, bordering on terrorists.  Gen X was probably the first generation that even *began* to question whether any of this stuff even *was* subversive.  The Greatest Generation (that's Reagan's generation) was still alive and still very much in control, and they were, almost without exception, **positive** that an LGBTQ lifestyle was subversive.

Back then, sweeping the South (in opposition to LBJ signing the Civil Rights Act) wasn't enough for Goldwater to win, but it unified the Southern segregationists under the Republican tent for the first time. But people like a winner, and Goldwater got crushed. So the strategy didn't really bear a success until Reagan. Nixon was broadly popular, and didn't need to leverage segregationist sentiment or ""Law and Order"" rhetoric (again, the idea that the President should be involved in our local policing was something that Goldwater famously brought back into Republican policy).

"I think they (Republicans) would have tried to impeach/hang Gore if it happened under his watch.

But I actually think 9/11 would not have happened under Gore.  Bush, Rice and Rumsfeld flagrantly and dedicatedly ignored a series of credible intelligence reports that named some of the future hijackers, where they lived, and what they were doing.  By 2000, Clinton had identified Osama Bin Laden as the most serious threat and Bush reversed a lot of policies and plans that could have affected the entire organization.   We can never know, but after the entirety of the 9/11 commission, there is a lot hypothetically that could have been quite different.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"Again daily reminder that Gore lost not because of Ralph Nader or because of the Supreme Court but rather because of over 200,000 democrats that voted for Bush during that election. 

It's far more convenient to say the third parties are 'spoilers', albeit factually untrue. 

It's also very inconvenient year after year to say third parties are 'wasted votes' while at the same time saying you are into 'protecting' democracy. 

I have news for everyone here. A Trump vote in Massachusetts or a Harris vote in Oklahoma hold the same impact as a Chase Oliver or Cornel West in the majority of this country. 

The main difference? 

Voting third party means that if a third party gets five percent, they get federal election funding. Meaning this two party system everyone bitches about but still bizarrely still want to protect (the vote blue no matter who or better red than dead crowds) would be a thing of the past. 

However, in my experience, most voters don't actually care about 'fixing the system' any more than voting for one of the two major parties, more often than not the Democratic party. 

We can act upon the work that Fairvote does and advocate RCV too, but we much rather mindlessly go 'TEAM BLUE OR TEAM RED' instead. Neither the Republican or Democratic parties want RCV, though, because it would squash their holds on voting power in the US. Both parties want you to be compliant, pick a side, and just shut up. The true fact of the matter is that we have an 'illusion' of choice and that's all that it will be until real reform is done and we have parties and candidates that represent more than just the far right and whatever the democrats feel like running as that current cycle.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"While usually I would agree, as an outsider (European) I would say that those elections are clearly NOT the ones to try to overturn the two party system.

As a leftist in European standards (for reference, I consider Bernie Sanders to be a centre-left to leftist politician), believe that Kamala would not be my first, second, or third option if I could vote. But despite that, I would vote for her, without any doubt. Because every vote matters. Because you are choosing between her or an autocrat. Because we know what Trump is going to do if he is president. Because you need to stop this madness, once and for all. Right now, we all can lose much more than 4 years of a republican government. We can lose an ally in the geopolitical struggle against autocracies, we can lose the fight to prevent the worst effects against global warming, we can lose the war against the fake news. We can lose the war in Ukraine or a determent against a Chinese war in Taiwan, or conflicts in the Korean Sea. We can lose the credibility of the most influential democracy in the world.

So, please, every vote matters. Every vote against Trump must be under Kamala. Because every vote against freedom, justice and democracy will be under Trump.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"I began parting company with the Democratic party under B Clinton.  But Bush promised to slash red tape, deregulate, continue the wonders of Reaganomics, and look what happened.  Reaganomics is single handedly responsible for the giant wealth transfer from the working/middle class to the billionaire/investor class.  I agree with you about Glass-Steagall, plus, honestly, a majority of Americans bought the bullshit, or close to a majority in the case of Bush/Gore.

It is not unfair to hold the Republican party accountable for their platform over the prior 40 years.  As far as giving people homes, they got them short term, then the banks got bailed out.  A lot of people were just literally destroyed, so they could live in a fancier house.

I think the most damaging thing in the 90's was the change in the patent laws, which occurred under Clinton and made r & d much less profitable in the United States.  If we want an advancing tech sector, they need to be able to make their research actually pay when it does hit.

However I like Harris so far, she's pragmatic, and I really like the Biden/Harris medicare reforms, and there is much more room there for cost savings and better outcomes for beneficiaries.

"I thank you for proving my point. 

The two party system exists mainly because we allow it to exist.  More importantly, voting third-party is about much more than winning or losing; it is about expanding the platform of minority parties and independent candidates. That's what Democracy is. Having more choice and say. Not less. 

If all of Jo Jorgensen's votes went to Trump in 2020, it wouldn't have made a difference, and Biden still would have won. 

You live in Illinois? Say a voter there votes for Chase Oliver. According to 538 and the most available polling, Harris is leading Trump in that state 58 to 42 percent. 


Please explain to me how a vote for any third party in Illnois is a 'vote for Donald Trump' when Harris is automatically gonna win that state? Newsflash: it isn't.

A vote for Trump in IL, CT or *insert blue state here* is even more of a 'wasted vote' than a third party. In same regard a vote for Harris in Oklahoma or Mississippi is a 'wasted vote' because she has zero shot to win those states.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"It’s not about “allowing it to exist”, it’s about a collective action problem that will necessarily result in it existing. If we want to solve the collective action problem, we need to change our electoral system to something like ranked choice voting. Our current system requires voters to think strategically.

Any “expanded platform” for third parties will necessarily come at the cost of established parties, resulting in a split vote. Say I vote for noted grifter Jill Stein: I would be helping to split the Democratic vote in my state, which would necessarily benefit Republicans in my state. I’m lucky that my state is solid blue, but *the last thing I would want to do* is enable a left-oriented third party (by American standards) to gain traction for runs in other, more competitive states.


So by your logic, if I voted for Trump, I wouldn’t be helping Trump win Illinois because he was just gonna lose anyway? That’s absurd.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"Respectfully, this is a talking point based on the experience that in my country the vote division on the left and the concentration in the right led to more right -winged governments that I would like, despite more people voted for left-leaning parties.

Like it or not, Trump is a threat to democracy, and this is not an issue to take it lightly. You are not going to accomplish anything dividing the anti Trump vote. Because, even if you achieve this 5%, those votes would be votes lost (or not won) by Kamala. This will increase Trump margin. And, I hope not to be correct, but under a Trump victory, I would worry more about avoiding to implement a one party system than to implement a three/four/N party system.

And this is not a talking point. This worry was not under Bush Jr., Bush Sr. or Reagan. This election is different. The worry here is not to win or lose an election. Is to win or lose democracy. And, respectfully, failing to understand that is a disservice you make to the democracy you say you want to protect",2024_11_06,05_05_54
Delegitimize the vote by abstaining or vote for a third party.,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"You can call it absurd, but it's a reality.  The only reason this reality exists as it is, is because we have the Electoral College. Under that model, your vote only matters if you live in one of a handful of states. That's harsh to say but it's fundamentally true. If you live in a decided state your vote does matter, but more so within the down ballot races. As it stands now, a vote in Illnois is different than a vote in Pennsylvania.  It's in my opinion, absurd to think otherwise. 

We as Americans have every right to change this in our country. We simply choose not to. To be fair however, ranked choice voting has been implemented in states like Alaska and Maine and both states seem to like its implementation where it's been more than not, a success.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"This worry was 100 percent seen under Bush. Rightfully so, Bush was a war criminal whose administration bombed and invaded not one but two wrong countries after the horrific 9/11 attacks. 

As a European, it should give you pause that under the Biden/Harris administration, the Taliban are selling weapons we purposely left in the Middle East during the withdrawal of Afghanistan. 

It should give you pause that the same Kamala Harris who tries to talk like a progressive is in bed with Blackrock. 

https://nypost.com/2021/01/08/kamala-harris-top-economic-advisor-is-another-blackrock-exec/

Blackrock BTW is the same investment firm that is actively buying up single family homes. 

It also should give you great pause that under the Biden/Harris administration, deportations were on track to be higher than the first term of Trump. 

https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ELECTION/MIGRATION-DEPORTATIONS/akpeoeoerpr/

https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/biden-on-track-to-exceed-trump-obama-in-deportations-in-first-term-data-shows

If you think either candidate isn't a threat to immigrants, you are strongly mistaken. 

The reason why Harris has been attracting a lot of billionaires and disenfranchised Republicans is because she's not gonna govern like a progressive, she is going to govern like a Bush era Republican. Both are oppressive choices. I respectfully think both spit in the face of democracy.

Harris has an oppressive record as a prosecutor, where during this time, she cost the city of California millions of dollars, convicting a man who was not guilty of the crime he was accused of

She has also used prisoners as 'cheap labor' 

https://www.kqed.org/news/12000397/what-9-cases-from-kamala-harris-past-say-about-her-record-as-a-california-prosecutor

This person, is a terrible choice to be president. Simple as that. Nor, to be frank do I think she cares about the every day person she pretends to care about. Just because Donald Trump is monstrous does not mean someone else who undeniably has an equally horrifying record means she is 'less horrifying'. All it means is that both candidates are horrifying.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

I believe that is why Nye focuses on the young vote. Data says young eligible voters are typically more progressive. This year 41 Million members of Gen Z are eligible to vote. The highest turnout ever for the youth vote was 28% in 2020 before dropping to 23% in 2022. If even half of those 41 million eligible members of Gen Z cast a vote it would likely give the Democratic Party both chambers.,2024_11_06,05_05_54

You can hear Trump for yourself echoing some of the vilest dehumanizing rhetoric in history by calling people ""vermin"" and ""not human"" and ""animals"" and saying they're ""poisoning our blood."" He says he didn't know that Hitler said that last one too. He wants you to know he's not quoting Hitler, just thinking along the same lines.

You can hear Trump for yourself saying he wants to use the US military against ""the enemies from within,"" and identifying Pelosi and Schiff as examples.

You can hear Trump for yourself on a recorded call pressuring the GA sec of state to ""find"" the exact number of votes he'd need to win by one vote, and suggesting that they could just say they ""recalculated."" Pressuring an elected official to commit fraud is a felony. He committed a felony on a recorded phone call.

You can watch Trump for yourself on video making promises about a fake ""university,"" and you can watch him for yourself on video (under oath) admitting to all the elements of fraud. He settled because he was going to lose. It was a rich guy scamming working class folks, many of them for over $20k.

1.	⁠Global Impact: U.S. decisions on climate change, international trade, and global security affect everyone. Your vote influences policies that ripple far beyond American borders.
2.	⁠Stand Up for Democratic Values: Voting is a powerful way to shape and protect democracy. In a world facing challenges to freedom and rights, every voice for fair representation matters.
3.	⁠Address Shared Issues: From healthcare and education to climate action, many of the issues at stake in the U.S. elections are universal. Your vote impacts progress on these critical fronts.

"2 things.

The pollsters were lying back then and lied right up until the other day and today. Biden was always ahead and that is the only scenario that makes any sense at all. I do think kamala is adding a lot more to the winning side and definitely got more people to donate and things like that. I think it was smart to switch it up but I felt it was stupid at the time. They flew him across the globe before that debate. I blame his staff because I know I am half his age and I couldnt have the energy to do a debate after a flight like that.

I also dont think its fair to come away from the debate and say biden lost. Trump lost. The media spun it. Thats it. Trump lost that debate hardcore and they only pointed out the mistakes biden made which are exactly the ridiculous standards kamala was held to which there are numerous articles about. the media spun it because that sells more ads. biden nailed that debate with some flubs but the man was tired.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Making sure proper protection is in place to allow for workers that have to work be it hospitals, food service, fire/police, 24 hour IT positions.  Feel free to correct me further, but the employee protection now only says that if you're working while polls are open that employers have to allow you to vote.

Better suggestions would be federal minimums on drop boxes and polling places per 10k residents; federal minimums on in-person polling hours on weekends, late nights and early mornings; longer periods of early voting; and same-day registration.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

If I didn't have to work today, I would have used a vacation day yesterday and taken a nice 4-day weekend trip somewhere, so I'd be less likely to vote.

"Answer: Republicans have blocked every attempt to move voting day to the weekend or declare it a national holiday.

Why would they do that?

While Republicans have a very loud and enthusiastic voting bloc, they have very unpopular stances on most issues and rarely produce any specific plans other tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations. On other issues, they offer only grievances and vague claims to ""fix"" them without saying how (see Trump's ""concepts of a plan"" after 10 years of attacking and trying to kill the ACA).

Because their platform is unpopular to people who understand and pay attention to the issues, they get support by creating culture wars and outrage by spinning isolated incidents into full-blown nation-wide disasters that will destroy families and threaten safety (see trans people using restrooms or the powerful Christian majority somehow being constantly under threat and ""forced"" to attack religious freedom for all other religions so that they can survive), and calling their opponents scary buzzwords that don't even mean what the Republican base thinks they mean (communist, Marxist, socialist, etc.) and are not remotely true of the people they label with their name-calling.

But even with the rabid base they earn from these culture wars, they're still in the minority. So they use every tool in their disposal to limit the vote, throw out votes, and select their voters. The more voters there are, the less likely Republicans will win. That's why mid-term elections without the presidential vote on the ballot often rewards Republicans because many people don't bother voting in those ""less important"" elections—but the rabid Republicans would never miss a vote. Most importantly, it comes down to Republicans choosing their voters by gerrymandering districts (cutting them into crazy shapes so that they'll mathematically reduce Democratic votes into fewer districts—a state with 10 districts where Democrats soundly win the popular vote will often fall to Republican control anyway by numbers like 7-3 because of gerrymandering. And then the electoral college gives extraordinary power to rural communities and low population states, making the overall popular vote irrelevant to who actually wins the presidency. For example, when a voter in the densely populated state of California votes, that vote has something like 1/50 the power of someone who lives in a cabin in the woods of Montana. The GOP then uses all of these advantages that got them in power to keep those advantages in place: they protect their ""right"" to gerrymander and choose their voters, they insist on keeping the electoral college to cancel out the popular vote, they want the filibuster to suppress the voter's desires once in office, and they appoint partisan judges to lock in unpopular partisan positions as the law of the land, and they block legislative votes from even taking place on things majority (sometimes in 90% range) desperately want... like a national holiday for voting, sensible gun laws, immigration reform (so they can use it as an outrage issue), etc.

Why don't the voters get angry and turn on the Republicans for all of this manipulation? Well, because the media on the right paints an entirely different reality from the one we all live in that propels all of those concocted outrages into the mainstream conversations. The media outlets in the middle fear being called biased so much, they both-sides every argument even when one side is not operating in good faith... and it gives credibility to the craziness on the far right as if it could be real. And then the people on the left trying to herd people back to reality are labeled far left extremists and soundly ignored—except for the ones already sitting inside their bubble. So, no matter how far the right drifts away from reality, the media follows them into their fever dreams making them seem real... which in a way, kind of makes them real simply because that's how they're perceived.

But the vast majority of Americans—when asked about the issues without party identification—agree on most everything. So it benefits Republicans to keep information low so their faithful don't realize how their policies hurt them, and keep their loyal followers turning out by hammering them with a barrage of disinformation and outrage—while keeping Democratic turn-out low by creating helplessness and apathy over the lack of knowledge on the other side and the impotence of actual facts.

However, if Democrats get fired up and show up, Republicans will lose every time. So they want voting to be hard, they want to choose who gets to vote, and they want to dictate how they vote.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

So making election day a holiday would really just incentivize those at the bottom that need representation the most, to go to work instead of vote, and incentivizes businesses to hold sales due to the increased traffic because higher wage workers do tend to have holidays off.

Instead, why does voting have to happen on a single day? Why not make the first week of Nov ""national voting week"" and have polls open for the entire period, so people can vote when they have the free time, rather than forcing free time into their schedule. or, make the deadline a certain day, but allow people to vote any day - April 15th is ""Tax day"", but I can pay my taxes on Jan 1 if I want.

Now, if I move before I can do that, that's about the only time that things get hairy. But even then I can still vote by mail for my previous riding.

When you file your taxes, there's often an option to be sent info on registering to vote.

That said, exit polls, especially now, are incredibly unreliable as a way to measure what will happen.  Exit polls are useful *after* the election, not during, because there's no control group or standardization among who is selected (they often will make attempts to do so but it's simply not nearly as scientific as pre-election polling and we've all seen how those have been).",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"It's not. Sorry I can't huff you up but this election is tight and it shouldn't be anything but a blowout if Harris' messaged was resonating with voters.

The narrative here was that every woman and most of the men were going to landslide this because abortion was taken away. But it's essentially the same as 2020 so that's clearly not what's going on.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

No seriously. Why does it matter? She is the VP, so she was chosen in 2020 by the voters. Joe dropped out, so by definition she gets the role we chose her for.

"It doesn't matter what you think. Democrats did not have the power to put Biden out of the race. He had to choose to step aside. The Dems didn't pull him. He had to voluntarily step aside. And as you yourself said, he had to be pressured real fucking hard to do it.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"The voters chose Biden. Biden would have won if his VP was almost anyone else. VPs historically mean very little in presidential elections.

So your argument falls flat. Sure, people settled on the idea that in some rare event, Harris might have been president under his term. But when they weighed Trump vs. Biden, and they liked Biden, it didn't matter who his VP was. But to make her the candidate is an entirely different game. It's dishonest to say it's a stupid argument to not like how they chose their candidate because she was already VP. It's entirely dishonest.

I think you know this. You might not care how she was chosen, but you should be able to empathize with those who do care.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
I had not heard that term and just read a bit about it. That is part of what I’m criticizing. Thank you for educating me. I also still stand by not liking how Kamala was selected after Biden bowed out. I understand why it happened but was not a fan,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"It is understandable, but in my opinion undermined the democratic process. I do think Biden is one of the few people on earth that could have lost an election to Trump. Biden is simply not mentally there. I do believe that it has been obvious for a while that he wasn’t mentally fit and he never should have been running for a second term to begin with. That’s the problem I have with it. The people could have picked between Harris, Newsom, Buttigieg, Moore, Whitmer, Shapiro, etc. Instead Kamala was picked for the people when she had the lowest approval rating of a vice president in American history. 

Not saying to not vote for her just saying don’t let the party you back off so easy just because the other party is acting worse.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
When the incumbent pulls out of the race their vice president is not automatically given the primary. That’s what this discussion has been about. It seems like a shockingly large amount of people though that’s just how it works. The Democratic Party could have put someone else forward instead of Kamala. Kamala did not win the primary election.,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"Yes I agree with that. They had to pressure him and he eventually gave in on his own.

The problem is the people did not vote for Joe with Kamala as his replacement. Even when removing Joe. It was not guaranteed that it would be Harris. That is a lie or you are miseducated. That’s not how the primary works. If Joe had to step down while in office it would work like that, but not during a primary.

Here is an article talking about how the democrats would replace Biden in the event he steps down: https://apnews.com/article/biden-harris-dnc-next-steps-2024-election-13bbcca73ca682f16284cf8874011dfa

Kamala simply taking over for him is not how the primary  election works.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
Yes but after Biden dropped out I wish they had a more open process. Maybe have a few different people speak at the DNC,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"Because they only ask a small amount of people, they have to weight those people onto an aggregate. Because more older people likely answer. So they were making their projections based on that demographic turning out at 90% and using those big Trump swings in that demo, to pump their numbers.

"Hard to believe that someone who wants the Democrats to win would care about it. It was 3 months before the election, having a contested convention would hand the election to Trump.

They needed unity. If that caused feelings to be hurt, that sucks, but it was ultimately the best choice they could have made. The alternative would have been a deeply damaging convention with lots of mud slinging and hurt feelings all around. And less unity means less voters.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"> I understand why it happened but was not a fan

there are no alternatives to offer other than ""hold a surprise primary election season across the country on no notice 2 months before the election"" which is a completely nonsensical suggestion.  

the ONLY viable option here would be ""Biden must run for re-election and lose"" which is, obviously, what the GOP wanted.  but there is no rule or law that requires this.  they just want to win, they don't give a shit about democracy.  they are THE party of suppressing votes and trying to overturn elections.  criticisms of the Dems being undemocratic are projection and deflection, and while I don't want to be a dick, buying into those frivolous comments is beneath an informed, intelligent person.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"There was not enough time for that, my guy and she secured 98% of delegates at the convention. 

The other thing that you're failing to realize is, nobody was going to challenge her in a primary to potentially damage her chances in the general. Her two biggest challengers would have been Whitmer and Newsom, both of which are angling for 2028.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"I hate to be the one to tell you this, but this argument has been made since at least the 70s.

"You're jumping over their argument against this.

Yes, there wasn't a lot of time. That's the issue. They have known of Biden's decline for much longer than this. They could have forced a primary but instead hid it until it was too late to.

Again, I think Harris was genuinely their only choice here, but I'm not so blind to think this was always the case. I find their decision to hide this and then dodge the primary process as a result, to be pretty disgusting myself. 

If you can't empathize with this position, then you're being intentionally daft for the sake of partisanship or undeserved loyalty.

You can support the dems, hate Trump, all at the same time as being disappointed in how Harris was chosen. There is no inconsistency here. Maybe you genuinely don't care, but scolding others for caring is dishonest.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"As a European, I can’t vote in the U.S. elections, but I can tell you this: your vote matters more than you might think, not just for America, but for the whole world. Here’s why:

1.	Global Impact: U.S. decisions on climate change, international trade, and global security affect everyone. Your vote influences policies that ripple far beyond American borders.

2.	Stand Up for Democratic Values: Voting is a powerful way to shape and protect democracy. In a world facing challenges to freedom and rights, every voice for fair representation matters.

3.	Address Shared Issues: From healthcare and education to climate action, many of the issues at stake in the U.S. elections are universal. Your vote impacts progress on these critical fronts.

So if you’re eligible, please vote today! You’re not only choosing leaders for the U.S.; you’re helping shape a world many of us believe in and support. Make your voice heard—today counts!",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Not a fan of Taylor Swift. Her entire persona is so meticulously curated that nothing feels real and her fanbase couldn't be more annoying if they tried. But, it's impossible to argue that her influence didn't help Biden win in 2020, which is why I was so critical of her for not endorsing Harris earlier in the race. She had already set a precedent by endorsing Biden in 2020, and to top it off, Trump was blatantly lying about her endorsement and posting fake AI images of her. Her reluctance to take a stance in the face of all of that was disappointing and frustrating.

All of that being said, I still appreciated how important it was for her fanbase to mobilize in this election in the same way it did in 2020, so I was relieved and grateful of her finally announcing her endorsement of Harris. Every vote matters so better late than never.

But now, today, on Election Day, when the final push is needed as much as possible and people need to be mobilized to finally, actually vote for ***Harris***, the candidate Taylor very publicly endorsed...all she can muster up is a single throwaway line about a reminder to vote? You already endorsed Harris! What could possibly be the motive to not highlight that?? Remind people of it! Remind them where their demi-god idol stands in this race! Make your Trump fans uncomfortable! Force them to reckon with their decisions! Shove it in their faces! Go big! Say it with your chest and let Brittany Mahomes hear it! If there were any ""damage"" to be done by endorsing Harris, it's already been done! What are you holding back for at this point??

I just don't understand her logic with this election. A reminder to get out and vote is good, but it's so lukewarm and conspicuously non-partisan. Yes, as I mentioned, she did very publicly endorse Harris already, so who's to say another message about it on Election Day would move the needle much at this point. But it just feels so strange and unnecessary to...avoid it? It goes back to everything being so meticulously curated. Leaving out any mention of Harris/Walz is absolutely deliberate and it brings me back to that same feeling of disappointment and frustration. It all just feels directly contradictory to the curated persona of feminist ally, and it bothers me to see another powerful billionaire quietly hedge their bets at a time that demands principled stands.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

2) Were raised to support the political majority side but later changed their political views

3) Were raised to support the political majority but rebelled and have always chosen the opposing political view.

The extremely awkward fact is that the vast majority of millionaires and billionaires support Harris instead of Trump.

I guess that is a good thing, as long as Trump loses, but it just reinforces the point that Democrats are losing their status as the party of the working class.

For example Harris has shamefully come out in support of fracking, of gun ownership, and Israel. She opposed all of these things before she started receiving millions of dollars from the ultra wealthy.

Whether she SHOULD have done more or not isn't what I've been talking about, only that she COULD have done more if that were her intent because she has the resources, in response to a previous comment, and that I am happy she has spoken up. \*Elated\* even.

I think we should bracket the tour thing as a factor here. I don't think it's fair even to Swift, for some reason I feel like that kinda undermines her agency or makes it out like she's not capable to walk and chew gum at the same time. She did walk and chew gum at the same time. I'm as stoked about what her actions could mean for future youth engagement as I am about her endorsement for Harris (well, almost). Getting out the vote is huge. So I think for my part it's good to have these conversations about stars' ability and responsibility when they get involved in political messaging.

I'm not defending her in any way, she is still immature and entitled...but most 20-somethings today seem to be that way too.

If he wins, he'll start pushing for the end of term limits and start campaigning on that.

He's addicted to the cheers and adulations he gets from the rallies. Plus campaigning serves him 2 purposes 1) It helps to keep him out of jail, since he can make the argument that it's all political persecution. It won't save him forever, but it does help 2) Fundraising for his endless campaigns is about the only income he has these days.

Now, that's not to say it'll be a successful campaign. I don't think he can win the nomination if he's a 3 time popular vote and 2 time electoral vote loser, but that won't stop him from trying.

"He's almost 80 and has dementia. As delusional as he is, and as often as he has claimed he's as healthy and cognitively able at a much younger person, I'm surprised he would admit this is his last time. Unless he's still expecting to pull a coup and become a dictator.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

You can't run if you are on the lamb in Russia.,2024_11_06,05_05_54
I'm genuinely confused. Isn't it illegal for a convicted felon to vote for president?,2024_11_06,05_05_54
You mean he’s not going to run when he’s 82 years old? Shocking!!!,2024_11_06,05_05_54
No it won’t. He will take two years off and try again (if he isn’t bankrupt or in jail by then). The grift is too good.,2024_11_06,05_05_54

We can’t do things the way we used to, folks. But believe me, we have our own methods. One great story is about the time I took a ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I headed to Morganville—what they called Shelbyville back then. I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style, you know? The ferry ride cost a nickel, and back then, nickels had pictures of bumblebees. “Five bees for a quarter,” you’d say. Can you believe it folks?!

Now, let me tell you, back in those days, people were tough. They’d eat just about anything—cats, dogs, you name it! It was survival of the fittest. But the important thing was that onion on my belt—that was the style at the time! No white onions available because of the war; just those big yellow ones. Never in the history of mankind have you heard of such a thing.

"Yes, but also not necessarily. 

Ann Selzer has an insane track record and has only missed twice. (2004 Presidentual race and the 2018 governor's race.)

She was the proverbial canary in the coal mine for Clinton's narrow loss in 2016 and the signal that Biden wasn't going to run away with it in 2020. 

There has been *some* evidence that the Sun Belt is moving towards Trump while the Rust Belt (of which Iowa is sort of part of) is solidifying more towards Harris, mainly due to her surprising strength with white voters. (The Sun Belt is more diverse.) This poll doesn't dispute that, but it could suggest she's doing better with white voters than anyone thought..

At the very least, it could prove to be good signals for important neighboring electoral votes, mainly Wisconsin and Nebraska-2 (which is incredibly important in the Harris-wins-with-270 path) because they are demographically similar.

 In the best case, it heralds a blowout, and we'll all be like, ""I mean, obviously, the signs were there all along"" this time tomorrow. 

Worst case, it's an outlier.

EDIT: The other ""worst case"" is that Harris wins Iowa, but it's more due to Iowa politics and the draconian abortion ban passed this summer and less a signal she'll blow Trump out.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Iowa is a strong indicator of the moderate/undecided sway",2024_11_06,05_05_54

But basically, yes.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"If she wins Iowa there's one of 3 things going on in order of most likely.

1. The most accurate pollster is correct. It's a signal that all the polls have been off and women are turning out in extreme numbers to take back their rights. Iowa flips, or is very close.

2. The most accurate pollster is correct and Iowa is flipping but other states don't have the same turnout / change.

3. The most accurate pollster is wrong and Iowa is a Trump landslide victory.

The long and short of it is that even if Trump wins Iowa, but it's by 2% instead of 10%, this could be a signal that the race isn't as close as we are led to believe, because if he can't carry a red state like Iowa, then he's going to have trouble with toss up states.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
Sure would be one hell of a positive sign for her to flip that state. If only she could nab Texas too,2024_11_06,05_05_54

"To be sure, this poll is an outlier. But it's from one of the most respected pollsters in the country with a long history of accurate polls.

If the poll is accurate and Harris wins Iowa, it would be exceptionally likely that she wins the presidency. Polling error in election years tends to go in the same direction -- either toward one candidate or another. If most polls (the ones that suggest Trump comfortably winning Iowa) are off enough that Harris wins Iowa, that also means she's likely winning swing states, especially the demographically similar swing states in the Midwest

Put another way, if Harris wins Iowa, it will be icing on the cake and very unlikely that Iowa decides the election.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Iowa is a funny thing.  For most of my life they’ve been considered a swing state, and the only times they went for the Republican candidate since 1988 were 2004 (re-election of W Bush) and the last two elections (Trump).  Some of those were pretty close elections (the Bush years), but the Trump numbers in 16 and 20 almost mirror the Obama numbers in 08 and 12. 

So, people characterizing this as some absolutely wild phenomenon are either too young to remember elections prior to 2016 or else they just think the entire Midwest is hard right aside from Minnesota and Illinois.  Kansas or Missouri going for Harris would be a miracle—Kansas has a Democratic governor but can’t ever seem to go for a Democratic president.  Iowa isn’t all that crazy.  

All that said, Iowa going for Harris would be a great sign.  Being *close* like in the Bush years would be a great sign.  Both that Iowans got their senses back and that swingy states will have better margins.  Fingers crossed.  ",2024_11_06,05_05_54

As Prof. Clinton of Vanderbilt University discusses in [this article](https://goodauthority.org/news/election-poll-vote2024-data-pollster-choices-weighting/), pollsters are doing a ton of weighting at this point that may make their results entirely subjective. 

Could Selzer be wrong? Sure. I don’t expect Harris to win Iowa. But I do think that she caught a last minute trend that will be more impactful in the closer states, particularly the Blue Wall, than we realize.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

How wrong does that need to be for this not to be a great result for Harris?

If Iowa goes blue, then that signals there are STRONG chances that all of the swing states will also go blue, and that possibly some other historically red states might flip as well.  It IMO signals a Harris win by a landslide.

"I’ve been hearing a lot about “herding” results with the polls recently. Usually it tends to happen towards elections day which makes sense. However due to the unpredictable nature of the electorate as of recent (underestimating the amount of trump voters etc etc). I think the pollsters are really scared of putting a big lead out for one candidate over the other. So, saying 50/50 is the best option as either outcome still makes them look good. This thought process brings bias into the results and I think that’s what we are seeing here. 

Nate Silver himself said that there should be more outliers and variability in the data at this point and he hasn’t seen much which is a sign of herding. Selzer is a pretty reputable pollster and they could be capturing a very real phenomenon that is happening in more red states.

Or at least I hope lol",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"I saw a video of some guy deconstructing some recent poll. The poll was pretty favorable to Harris, but the guy dug into the tabulation data and what he found super interesting is that the poll *way* overestimated the number of people with an educational level of ""high school or less"" (usually lean Republican) that were going to vote. They were estimating that something like 90% of the people registered to vote with that education level would vote, when even at the height of Trump's popularity the number was close to 60%.

In other words: who the fuck knows what the results will be. Clearly pollsters have been trying to bend backwards to not underestimate Trump, which probably led to *huge* over estimation.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Being able to vote is an amazing thing. Keep voting in every election, not just every four years. Part of what got us into this mess was decades of many normal people not voting and allowing more and more crazies into office, from school boards all the way to the top of the ticket. That's why voter turnout is such a bad thing for the right because they know what they want is unpopular. Their best chance at control is lower turnout. If everyone showed up for every election, this mess would never have happened.

That impacts future campaign donations to both sides and how extreme the winning side can push their agenda once they start worrying about the next election cycle.

If a losing race is unexpectedly close, it allows a losing party to recruit a better, more winnable, candidate for the next election.  It can also cause a candidate with extreme viewpoints to have a well funded primary opponent the next time around because people in their party might be afraid they won't keep winning.

"Guess what other state has also polled about the same as Iowa recently and also has a draconian abortion ban?

"Pollsters got polls really wrong in 2016 when Trump ran, they were slightly less wrong in 2020 but still wrong. So now it MIGHT be the case (based on some of these highly reputable polls showing completely different data) that those polls are heavily weighing their polls toward Trump so they aren’t wrong again. Also, it’s possible they just want clicks and/or don’t want to be wrong so they say “oh it’s a coin flip! 49/49 or 48/48 with 2% undecided!”",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"You can read about it on a lot of technical wonky/statistics blogs (meaning this isn't some super secret), but the short answer is that they don't know how to get Trump right in polls.

The basic fear is that they have overcorrected, because they were wrong in both 2016 and 2020 (Biden won but they had him winning by more than he did in 2020, for example). So, the idea is that they have now overcorrected for it and are weighing Trump voters more/too much. Now, they could have gotten the models right this time, but there are a few reasons that might not be the case:

1. They aren't capturing some demographic that is behaving in a non-traditional manner (in 2016/2020 they weren't capturing the male white working class pissed off voters that broke for Trump). If Iowa is right, this time they might not be capturing pissed off white women correctly. This could be an across the board problem, but because Selzer does her polls in a pretty different way, her model is hard to replicate outside of Iowa (also note that Iowa just banned abortion, I think).
2. It's unlikely that every state everywhere is statistically tied: again this would be connected to overcorrecting, but we should see a little more variation than we are seeing.
3. There are weird things going on with down-ballot races. If you look at 538 and at a few polls you'll see it. In Nevada for example the Senate race is looking pretty good for Dems but Trump is up on the presidential ballot. That means that 4-8% (in some states), will have split votes heavily favoring a Dem in the Senate and Trump at the top. This just seems odd. It could be possible, but is odd.
4. The big one: Nobody knows how to poll anymore. The under 45 crowd doesn't answer the phone. Apparently, even when Gen Z does answer the phone they lie or just say undecided when they aren't (this could go either way). People that never voted seem to be voting this year too.

But, all this tea leaf reading at this point. Just need to vote and see what happens. Anyone acting certain at this point isn't being honest. Here is perhaps an overly [optimistic blog about it though](https://app.vantagedatahouse.com/analysis/TheBlowoutNoOneSeesComing-1?fbclid=IwY2xjawGXIjNleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHZdIYPBjL1ZWUFcrHOg47PXDbHjwJO2U4D7hhMBNW7VIrmXgbNE2frhvBg_aem_1Z_958_5laOLP6KUUpYkAw).",2024_11_06,05_05_54

You think the reason people oppose Trump is this kind of headline? Seriously?

There are more than enough reasons to oppose Trump just from *Trump in his own words* that you can hear for yourself, so long as you're not a fan of corruption and authoritarianism.


You can hear Trump for yourself echoing some of the vilest dehumanizing rhetoric in history by calling people ""vermin"" and ""not human"" and ""animals"" and saying they're ""poisoning our blood."" He says he didn't know that Hitler said that last one too. He wants you to know he's not *quoting* Hitler, just thinking along the same lines. 

You can hear Trump for yourself saying he wants to use the US military against ""the enemies from within,"" and identifying Pelosi and Schiff as examples. 

You can hear Trump for yourself on a recorded call pressuring the GA sec of state to ""find"" the exact number of votes he'd need to win by one vote, and suggesting that they could just say they ""recalculated."" Pressuring an elected official to commit fraud is a felony. He committed a felony on a recorded phone call. 

You can watch Trump for yourself on video making promises about a fake ""university,"" and you can watch him for yourself on video (under oath) admitting to all the elements of fraud. He settled because he was going to lose. It was a rich guy scamming working class folks, many of them for over $20k. 

All of which you can verify for yourself without trusting the mainstream media or anyone else, because you can hear him saying those things in his own words, with your own ears.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

However, Trump did publicly endorse and encourage the use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID. A medication that had 0 efficacy in treating COVID.

He also suggested people inject themselves with bleach. 

He continuously contradicted and demeaned Dr. Faucis authority on the matter, and bolstered the entire anti-mask movement.

Not to mention he downplayed the presence of the virus in the US, and severity of the virus. He delayed proper preparation for it and it resulted in an unmitigated disaster. The entire US Healthcare system was under-equipped to handle the 2020 outbreak. I wore the same surgical mask for 6 weeks. I used trash bags as medical gowns.

Do you have any reason for believing that? I've seen lots of people explaining why they oppose Trump, and the reasons aren't anything like this.

"***From Rolling Stone’s Tim Dickinson:***

Chris Hood, the founder of the thuggish neo-Nazi group NSC-131, has endorsed the MAGA candidate for president, calling on fellow fascists in the swing states “to vote for Donald Trump.”

In a long statement on Telegram, Hood described Trump as providing a small step forward to his goal of “ultimate victory,” and insisted that casting a ballot for Trump provides a no-regrets way for race separatists to act — “even if it means just one less Somalian in Maine, one less Haitian in Ohio, and one more foot of wall built.” He added, “It costs you nothing.”

The embrace by the Trump movement by a literal neo-Nazi — who was previously a member of the Proud Boys, Patriot Front, and another hate group called The Base — offers evidence that Trump’s late, ugly, attempts to expand his appeal to the fetid fringe of the American right could have met with some success. The Trump campaign did not respond to Rolling Stone’s request for comment.

Based in New England, NSC-131 is infamous for dressing in black and conducting intimidating and sometimes violent flash-mobs. NSC-131 has often attempted to mainstream its hate by riding MAGA coattails — targeting the same kinds of people in person that Trump blasts, rhetorically, in his stump speeches — whether that means shouting down Drag Queen Story hours at public libraries, or harassing migrant workers housed at Boston-area hotels.

Hood writes that the neo-Nazis’ long-term goals are not achievable quickly. “In the meantime though, It is our responsibility to think clearly and do whatever we can to preserve and improve what we can in these times,” he writes. “Because of this, I am advocating for all Nationalists in New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Virginia, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, North Carolina, and Michigan to vote for Donald Trump.”

> In a long statement on Telegram, Hood described Trump as providing a small step forward to his goal of &quot;Ultimate victory,&quot; and insisted that casting a ballot for Trump provides a no-regrets way for race separatists to act - &quot;Even if it means just one less Somalian in Maine, one less Haitian in Ohio, and one more foot of wall built.&quot; He added, &quot;It costs you nothing.""

> The embrace by the Trump movement by a literal neo-Nazi - who was previously a member of the Proud Boys, Patriot Front, and another hate group called The Base - offers evidence that Trump&#039;s late, ugly, attempts to expand his appeal to the fetid fringe of the American right could have met with some success.

> Strategically, Hood seeks to marry a &quot;Radical&quot; movement in the vein of NSC-131 with a &quot;Popular political movement.&quot; He has also advanced a slightly less-militant, white separatist movement called PINE, which has passed out literature at Trump rallies.

"fascist is not any more accurate, either.  it’s used as a synonym for right wing authoritarianism or nativist/nationalist but it’s quite a bit more specific than that.

I was a fervent and religious Stormfront reader and tbh MAGA is nowhere as extreme or as vile/evil. Stormfront is the deep underbelly recruiting racist cops into Law Enforcement or telling white nationalist to go to the military for training to kill the “muds”. MAGA is the poop floating on top of the Stormfront/8chan sewer water. I doubt many MAGA read that stuff anyways. You can hear the confirmation bias in what they say. They learn their crap on Fox News and Facebook they share with like minded “friends”.,2024_11_06,05_05_54

 \- Denying their support - ""Trump? Trump who? I wrote in Ronald Reagan..."" (they didn't)

 \- The hardcore Trumpers will, predictably, jump to wild conspiracies about Taylor Swift mind control, election tampering, and various other cheating accusations that have no basis in reality or actual evidence other than ""I heard from a guy who heard from a guy who saw somebody in a Harris hat stealing ballots in Pennsylvania!""

"These people signed up to work for him knowing about all the crimes he's committed and how terrible of a person he is in general. They tried to help him get elected. And now they're upset that he's not the most wonderful person to work for? 

Zero. Sympathy.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
There should be much self-loathing experienced by anyone supporting this traitor.,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"They were the ones who signed on to help him **after** J6 2020, **after** he *refused to give back extremely sensitive top secret documents that were and are the property of the US Government by* ***law****,* **after** he concocted the idea of banding together fake electors, **after** he was found civilly liable for *$450,000,000 + $81,000,000* over **tax fraud and the Carroll case, after** Trump was found *guilty for having* ***illicitly interfered in his own election*** and so on and so on and so on.

They should be disgusted with themselves. Though, I guess it doesn't matter too much since:

1. Their thoughts on anything just...don't matter. They aren't people who are worth acknowledging the existing of (let alone doing something really stupid such as talking to them whatsoever).
2. We're disgusted at them *for* them. It's literally just like 2nd hand and 3rd hand embarrassment. We're disgusted for them and we know, due to everything written at the top of this comment, that what ***they*** think of themselves (or even what they think of others) just shouldn't be factored in to anything. Theirs is an opinion not desired by anyone who matters and whose ability to vocalize their ""wants and desires"" is akin to that of listening to a belt sander for 24 hours straight.

Vote around these fuck sticks and they won't have a say in it. If Harris/Walz win, it's going to cause the Republican party to go through its own personal Armageddon. 

Trump will NOT want to dip out of the spotlight. It's everything he dreams of. He wants the constant attention no matter what the attention is for. He also wants to ""plausibly"" (no) use ""waaah I'm running for President in 2028 so you can't finish your **criminal trials on me**"" and their party is going to go through **hell and back as a result.** 

He will have lost two Presidential elections in a row, helped to make sure the Republicans lost drastically in each midterm ever since his 1 win in 2016 and he is inevitably going to further drag the spike into the Republican party after ***he loses***.

THIS is what Graham meant when he said Trump would destroy the GOP.

It's because he knew the Republican party leadership would simply allow it to happen. Not that Trump was some ""brilliant demolitionist"". It's because Graham knew what we all know:

Republicans don't vote for and don't want actual Democracy and as a result, the first one to truly ""test the waters"" came away with flying colors.....from the voter base. 

That then stung themselves with very disappointing midterm results each time ever since Trump win in 2016. Their party is going to suffer catastrophic failures after Trump loses this time and I'm pretty sure that's going to start the beginning of the end of the party. Will likely take quite a while before it finalizes, but make no mistake it'll be the start of the end. Their party can't afford to suffer this many loses across this many political fields, unendingly while Trump stays alive.

Which is precisely what Trump is going to do.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

It's pure magical thinking that Trump can be anyone other than who he is and who he's shown us to be.

The usual GOP policies, however, will continue on after Trump. There are plenty of other people in various positions outside of Trump. You have the majority conservative Supreme Court, you still have plenty of shameless GOP senators/governors, and you still have The Federalist Society. 

I think the one way that the Republican party could ""collapse"" would be if one of the other currently existing ""Independent"" parties gained a massive surge in public membership/endorsement by traditional GOP members, put forth competitive candidates in state level elections, and put forward a competitive candidate in the election after Trump is a fuzzy memory.

"Without making the usual Hitler comparison, there  are so many other history lessons that politicians & billionaires  (e.g. Musk) should learn from 1920s-1930s Germany before they make the same mistakes.

Numerous books, including ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"", detail the political/business enablers who helped Hitler rise to power.  Like today, they were helping for their own reasons.  Hitler was going to be their tool to accomplish their goals.

Paul von Hindenburg, President of Germany, didn't favor Hitler, but was talked into making him Chancellor, as a way of controlling radical elements, breaking the deadlock in Parliment.

Alfred Hugenberg was a media tycoon who wanted to jump on the bandwagon of Hitlers populist, mass appeal, and increase his own influence in many areas.

Many rich businessmen/industrialists saw Hitler as a tool to suppress leftist & labor movements, thinking Hitler would strengthen their economy and improve stability.  

Once Hitler gained power in 1933, he out-maneuvered them all.  He changed the rules of government that centralized much more power with him, allowing him to rule by decree & bypass parliment.  That was one of the big destabilizing moves that allowed him to sideline, imprison, or purge anyone who stood in his way.

Sound familiar?  Yet here we are, attempting to repeat history, to change government, do mass Fed Government firings (he expects thousands) & replace them with loyalists to centralize power/control, and a supreme court that already granted Trump immunity.

">The Truth Social parent lost $19.2 million during the period while revenue fell 5.6% to just $1.01 million from the year-earlier period.

I fail to see how they ever expected to generate ANY revenue. They certainly aren't selling ad space, at least not to anyone spending to reach an audience that anyone wants. 

Political ad buys are nil. They already get free propaganda built-in to the platform and it's purpose. And opposition ad dollars spent there would be worthless (if they even offered as space avails.) 

And all of the products are DonOLD GriftCo trash and trinkets. 

So how were they ever supposed to generate any revenue?",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Ok so they lost $363 million the first 9 months. With only a $19m loss, they’ve somehow dramatically cut costs and cut their losses this quarter. Revenue is still down.

I don’t care enough about this shitty scam of a stock to research it myself but I’d assume most of those losses were grifts - paying shell companies for non existent services, trump collecting the cash. There’s no way the engineers and servers for that sites and app cost more than $340 m to run the first 6 months of the year (more than $50m a month in losses) and the cut the overhear to $6m a month. 

They just paused the bleeding of the patient and will come back and bleed the last $600m cash on hand after the election.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

May this be good tidings of what may come.,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"It's *way* worse than it looks folks...   

Look at the 10Q for June 30 - here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001140361-24-036633.htm

See the column in balance sheet, current liabilities: ""unearned revenue""?  It's 2,924.6[0]

Now look in the 10Q for September.  Here:  https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001140361-24-045260.htm

And look at that unearned revenue figure now:  1,959.7[0]

It's down.  It's a liability. Good news, right?

Not so fast.  What is unearned revenue you ask?  It's money that was PAID in the past for services to be delivered sometime later.  When a dollar's worth of services are eventually rendered, then we add a dollar in the revenue line, and subtract a dollar in the unearned revenue line.  It's money the company gets to count as ""revenue"" in the future, even though customers won't be paying it in the future. 

What this means is that when unearned revenue goes down in a quarter, we can subtract that same amount from revenue in the quarter, to figure out how much customers actually paid the firm this quarter.

Revenue in Sept quarter was 1,010.9[0]

Reduction in unearned revenue was 2924.6-1952.7 = 971.9[0]

Which means my dudes that the full amount of money this firm collected from customers this quarter was not just over a cool million...  It was a mere $39K!!!    
 
And what did the company spend this quarter on sales and marketing to attract this $39K from customers?  $2,189.4[0]K

It takes a special kind of genius to spend 2 million to earn $40K.   That's the kind of financial genius that bankrupts casinos.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Something that also never seems to be brought up is the fact that there are a lot of people who just truly HATED Hilary, even among Democrats. The Dems’ leadership treated her as a sort of heir apparent the moment she was elected in NY without any thought to the fact that she carried a ton of baggage and acted like she was a complete shoe-in for the office when it came time. I mean, look at ‘08 and how people went hard for Obama—a relative new-comer—over and against her. But the Dems consistently ignored this and kept pushing her. Was she a better choice than Trump? Absolutely. But she was a divisive figure and I knew several Democrats who didn’t like her and were not willing to go out and vote for her (plus, they also thought Trump was a joke and would never win). 

But Kamala feels different. It’s the closest to Obama back in ‘08. It’s not just “anti-Trump” but actual excitement over her as a candidate. Plus, now people know what a Trump presidency would be. If Joe Biden of all people could win in 2020, I feel pretty hopeful about Kamala. People are actually voting *for* her, not just in opposition to the GOP. And that’s great and even exciting.

"In the end there are only three battleground states Kamala really needs. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. I think she's fairly secure enough in Wisconsin and Michigan, that even picking Shapiro wouldn't have lost her either of those states. But picking Shapiro might have won her Pennsylvania.

It's better to win all three states by a sliver, than it is to win by huge numbers in Michigan and Wisconsin, but lose in Pennsylvania. That's because all that matters in the end, is the electoral college.

Let's agree to disagree though. Again, I think she'll win either way. I'm just saying that if she does lose it will probably be Pennsylvania, and at that point all I can offer is hindsight that Shapiro might have made the difference.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

I think around here, they are finally dying down in their fervor, and if that's the case fewer of them might even be bothering to show up to vote.

Trump *literally* spoke like a child.

""When I'm president, you will have to do what I say!""

""When I'm president, I will get *two* scoops of ice cream, and you will only get one!""

""When I'm president, if you say mean things to me I'll just say 'Get him out of here', and the police will come and drag you away!""

His words and ideas are a child's vision of power. This is by his own admission, in a way:

[quote]
>Donald Trump's temper-tantrum tactics have been explained by the man himself. The frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination admitted to his biographer that, ""When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I’m basically the same. The temperament is not that different.""

>Pulitzer-Prize winning reporter Michael D'Antonio, whose book, Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success, comes out in late September, nabbed the quotable gem during his six hours of interviews with the real estate king . . .

"In 2016, the New York Times published a very detailed precinct-by-precinct online map of the vote totals in NYC.

Most of it was very blue, as expected.  There were a few red pockets that didn't surprise me.  The vast majority of Staten Island went for Trump, which wasn't surprising because Staten Island has been a Republican stronghold for decades, for some convoluted set of reasons.  

Another unsurprisingly red chunk of the map was a neighborhood called Breezy Point, at the far western end of the Rockaway peninsula.  That neighborhood is literally a gated community on a private beach.  In NYC.  It's clearly the kind of absolutely insane wealth where people's main concern is ""When I die, I need to leave my yachts to my children, without them having to pay taxes on it.""  So, no surprise there either.

There were however 2 other little red pockets within the city that made me scratch my head, and dig deeper to figure out ""What's going on there?""

One pocket was Brighton Beach, just a little east of Coney Island.   I'd been Coney Island a handful of times.  I'd walked along the beach down to Brighton Beach from Coney Island.  That whole area always seemed like Mets-fan-working-class-NYC to me. It made no sense that Brighton Beach would be Republican.  But... I learned, that Brighton Beach is also known as ""Little Russia.""  Not the explanation I was expecting to find, but certainly a clear explanation, of why that neighborhood would break for Trump.

Another red area that surprised me was a neighborhood called Middle Village, smack dab in the middle of Queens.  I had no experience with this area, and thusly didn't have any preconceived notions of how / why it would vote this way or that.  After a bit of googling though, I found out that back in the 70s and 80s, when NYC was genuinely a rough place... when Times Square was more like a red light district, than Disneyland... back when crime (both petty and violent) was genuinely out of control... The one safe neighborhood in the whole city was Middle Village.  Why?   Cause that's where all mafia top brass lived.  Every two-bit mugger and car thief and tweaked out addict knew not to fuck with anyone in that neighborhood, because the mob would find you, and respond 10-fold.

So... that's who voted for Trump in NYC, in 2016.   Russians, and the mob.  (And Staten Island and the insanely wealthy of Breezy Point).  The rest of the city knows him as the shitty grifter that he is.

Edit: Some words and some grammar.

Edit 2:  Apparently I made some very wrong assumptions about the demographics of Breezy Point.  Turns out it's not a super wealthy neighborhood (despite being a gated community on a private beach).  Apologies.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

The shine was already flaking off fixtures and the place had only been open for a month or two. Cheap flashing for the gram kinda vibes (but before digital cameras, lol).

"To hail as their own a man who, by all accounts, would have sneered at their toil in favor of glittering indulgence – it is a betrayal of reason, of the very spirit that forged this republic. The same steadfast, hard-laboring Midwesterners, renowned for their disdain of the city elite and the wealthy coastal class, have chosen, not just a man, but an emblem: a tycoon who rose by hawking his name in gold, the very gilded excess they’d once despised.  

They think he's one of them, but he’s not (🎶*They not like us, they not like us*🎶). He’s just what he’s always been – gold-plated, hollow, and selling the same empty dream. He mastered the language of their anger, crafted the appearance of rebellion, and offered a familiar villain, all while remaining the consummate outsider to their world.  

America thrives on spectacle, on symbols as hollow as they are dazzling – not on substance or principle. This isn’t leadership; it’s theater, a performance scripted to channel resentment and grievance, to reflect back the audience’s own discontent, distorted just enough to make him seem like an ally, not the very embodiment of what they claim to reject.  


And that’s precisely why it’s working. 'There must be an in-crowd and an out-crowd…' and he’s learned to play both. Unfortunately, the very same individuals who still cheer him on have yet to learn they’re the ones being played. To them, with little left to lose, why not side with the one who promises to hurt all the right people?",2024_11_06,05_05_54
">your waiter is a different race, are you polite to him..? 

This is exactly where racists think Black people should be, serving white people. To them, as long as it's clear that they, a white person, control the interaction and the Black person will do what they're told, the racist is generally cordial. 

To your actual point, it depends on how closeted their racism is. Where I grew up, there was a lot of racism, but it mostly happened outside of actual interactions with Black people. They'd bitch and moan about the Black person to their own family and friends, but in public they were civil. Some wouldn't acknowledge a Black person existed until circumstances called for it. Some wouldn't shake a Black person's hand or make any physical contact with them. If they had Black neighbors, they'd either eventually decide that they're some of the *good ones* or blame them for everything that goes wrong with their house/neighborhood and call the police on them for any minor thing. 

*Most* ^([citation needed]) racists I know just want Black people to stay *over there* and to *know their place* but it's never backed up with anything besides whining at home or with their friends. 

Since Trump has made it more socially acceptable to be racist in public, there's been a lot more overt racist things, like refusing to move out of the way on the sidewalk, spitting behind their backs, and generally loudly voicing complaints about ""those people"" when Black people are around. 

I haven't seen a resurgence of burning crosses or throwing bricks through windows, but if Trump ends up as president, I'd expect those events to follow.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

">“Folks, this is getting pretty simple now: Kamala and I trust women,” Walz said. “Now tomorrow, women all across America, of every age, both parties, are going to send a loud, clear message to Donald Trump, whether he likes it or not.”

Yup.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"I've noted these things in a couple different comments over the last few days, but here are my observations: 

I voted early this year and the early voting location (which is a feeder location for a good portion of the county's early voters) was filled with mostly women. I'd say around 80% women. And of that, a good portion of those were fairly young women in the college-age'ish demographic. 

Adding to that: my daughter and her friends are in that age demographic. And they have a seething hatred of the GOP. They're not stupid. They've heard loud and clear that the GOP is the party of ""we don't care if carrying your rapist's baby to term kills you."" *All* her friends early voted for Harris. 

I'm not sure if older folks realize how pissed off and politically active young women are now. The GOP took the mask off and flat out told millions of women ""You don't fucking matter one bit to us except for the pretty white ones, because we gotta get enough white babies to ensure we're not replaced."" 

Anybody who thinks that young women are somehow oblivious to the 24/7 misogynistic and hateful rhetoric pumped out by the right-wing in this country has their head up their ass.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Absolutely right on point. Women are tired of having their rights trampled on.   

Women are going to makes sure Trump never gets to walk in the White House. 

 I  know there are some women who support Trump. They are trad wives and those who think this doesn’t affect them.

 But the majority of women are not taking shit anymore. And they shouldn’t.     

I’m a white male Democrat and mad as hell that women’s rights are being ripped from them. It hurts everyone. 

  I hate the racism as well and racism benefits no one and stops the progress of society.

When we operate as a multicultural diverse society with compassion and community, we all win.

It's not ""some"".  Trump won majority of white women votes in both 2020 (against Biden) and 2016 (against Hillary).  The only reason democrats got total women vote was because black women turned out in droves.  

Most polling shows that Trump still has a lead with white women.  It's shrinking, but he still has that vote if we are the believe polling.

And Biden has chipped away at student loan debt despite the republicans' insistence that predatory lenders are the real victims. Look, if Roe forced red states to legalize abortion in 1973, we can do it again.

It's HILARIOUS to see a trumper, watching trump charge emotions and make everyone upset, accuse Democrats.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"The only ones holding back abortion rights and student loan forgiveness are Republicans.  Harris is simply pushing reproductive rights as a referendum to push Dem control of both the WH and Congress.  If she had that, yes, she absolutely would restore those rights (and it was a right before, so to say it was unconstitutional is not factual).  That and it would put the Democrats in a much better position to replace a SC slot with their own if one comes up.  And, as I said before, no one wanted abortion left to the states.  That's just an excuse Trump is pushing to women Republicans to temper the furor within his ranks for overturning Roe.

And the Republicans don't do the same?  Look at their platforms.  Can't talk about the economy as a whole because it's improved, so they harp on inflation while ignoring that it was a global issue related to Covid.  They harp on immigration, which has never been a traditional first tier issue, but conveniently never mention the fact there's a sweeping bipartisan immigration bill in Congress waiting for them to sign.  They can't talk about infrastructure, so they talk about Israel and Ukraine.  They can't talk about healthcare or lowering prescription drugs, so they talk about Afghanistan.  They can't talk about job creation, so they talk about LGBTQ+ rights and boys on girls teams.  They can't talk about lower crime rates and instead complain that the data is corrupt.  They can't talk about the Covid response, so they discredit science.  They can't talk about manufacturing jobs and tech initiatives, so they discuss losing jobs to China and immigrants.  They can't really talk about the debt, so they talk about tax cuts (which overwhelmingly benefitted the very wealthy).  

Trump talked about passing infrastructure legislation. He didn't get it done.  Biden did.  Trump couldn't figure out how to distribute Covid vaccines, and then left a federal emergency up to the states and his son-in-law.  Biden immediately took control and got it done.  Trump talked of repeal and replace of the AFA, but he couldn't repeal it and then had to admit Republicans had no actual replacement plan. The number of uninsured Americans reached record lows under Biden.  Trump promised to decrease prescription prices.  Biden ACTUALLY decreased a number of prescription drugs and became the first admintration to negotiate drug prices with Medicare.  Trump signed zero immigrations laws during his tenure.  Biden got 3/4 of Congress to accept the most sweeping bipartisan immigration bill in 30 years (and was killed not because it was a bad bill, but because it made Trump look bad...because, you know, Republicans care about immigration).  He wanted gun control, a staple of the Democratic platform and a wildly political topic, and still got a modest bill signed to law.  Biden got environmental provisions, always a Dem platform, into the Inflation Reduction Act. 

So when you say that Democrats campaign on things that can't be fixed, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.  BTW when the last three Republican presidents blew up the economy, and then Democrats promised to fix it, what happened?  I'll wait here...

I don't know if sweeping student loan forgiveness will ever be supported, but if the Dems get Congress and the WH, they will absolutely codify abortion rights (which is supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans).   And states aren't forced when it's federal law.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

This is in part why they get accused of being pedos by that sort - ""my kids teacher wants to talk to him about sex while keeping it a secret from me"" sets off all the alarms. 

>Also men in dresses in ladies washrooms

This is entirely a rehash of 2nd wave trans exclusive radical feminism. At the core of it is the notion that men are evil, dangerous predators and women need spaces that are safe, protected from male predation. 

From there, they just don't accept that trans is real and accordingly that trans women are either men adopting a disguise to get access to vulnerable women, men who hate themselves enough to sexually mutilate themselves and men who emulate women because it's the only way they can claim patriarchal ownership of a woman. 

You'll notice very little effort is spent on trans men, and that's because TERFs don't feel threatened by what they see as women wearing a disguise to steal patriarchal power for themselves. 

Tl;Dr - it's worth interrogating what they believe and where they get it from, because these ideas don't just appear in their brains ex nihilo and usually have some kind of origin point and backing, often blown dramatically out of proportion and sensationalized but it's still worth understanding.

"Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged in a private meeting on Wednesday that Trump’s animosity toward the yet-to-be-released border deal puts Republicans in a serious bind as they try to move forward on the already complex issue. For weeks, Republicans have been warning that Trump’s opposition could blow up the bipartisan proposal, but the admission from McConnell was particularly striking, given he has been a chief advocate for a border-Ukraine package.

  


Now, Republicans on Capitol Hill are grappling with the reality that most in the GOP are loathe to do anything that is seen as potentially undermining the former president. And the prospects of a deal being scuttled before it has even been finalized has sparked tensions and confusion in the Senate GOP as they try to figure out if, and how, to proceed – even as McConnell made clear during party lunches Thursday that he remains firmly behind the effort to strike a deal, according to attendees.

  


“I think the border is a very important issue for Donald Trump. And the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and congresspeople that he doesn’t want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for it is … really appalling,” said GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump.

  


He added, “But the reality is that, that we have a crisis at the border, the American people are suffering as a result of what’s happening at the border. And someone running for president not to try and get the problem solved. as opposed to saying, ‘hey, save that problem. Don’t solve it. Let me take credit for solving it later.’”

  


GOP Sen. Todd Young of Indiana called any efforts to disrupt the ongoing negotiations “tragic” and said: “I hope no one is trying to take this away for campaign purposes.”

  


“I would encourage (chief Senate GOP negotiator) James Lankford and other conservatives to produce a work product with which they will shortly allow conservatives like myself to review it and take heart that there are a number of us who won’t be looking to third parties and assessing the propriety of passing this bipartisan proposal,” Young said

WASHINGTON — Republican senators made it clear Tuesday that they will kill the border security bill their party negotiated with Democrats, a stunning turnaround less than 48 hours after it was released by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., and blessed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

  


McConnell, R-Ky. — overruled by his Senate GOP members, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and former President Donald Trump — conceded it has no path to passage.

It may be a result of being exposed to polarized media sources, but I’m not aware of any drawbacks. Trump did talk about.. people aborting babies after they’re born…? At the presidential debate? But that seems… very not correct.

The ironic thing is that the Republicans who ended up voting to make abortion illegal got into office because Democrats were threatening more gun control laws.

I love to use many different sources when researching politics. Starts with a google search, “Kamala Harris” “Joe Biden” or “Donald trump” click news, I go through several different news stations, government websites, records, to verify anything I see. CNN has got to be the worst station I have ever seen, they twist words and blatantly lie with 0 consequences, hope mark robinson wins the case against them even if it’s only 25k, it’s the principle.

I just wish more people could see that they’re being manipulated by the Democratic Party. Independent research is important.

> According to Google Trends, search results for &quot;Did Joe Biden drop out&quot; have peaked this week, and are spiking on Election Day, even though the president had dropped out of the 2024 race this summer and endorsed the current Democratic Party nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.

> While it&#039;s been months since Biden officially dropped out of the race, apparently there are still Americans who don&#039;t know who&#039;s running for president.

> &quot;Imagine being a voter who just today found out Joe Biden isn&#039;t running,&quot; Armand Domalewski, a data scientist and cofounder of YIMBYs for Harris, posted on X Tuesday.

And by now they do deserve a massive response, like capturing and impounding any ship that comes out of a Russian port for any reason, and selling its cargo, benefits going to Ukraine.

Russia and China still depend on the US to be the world's policeman, when it comes to international trade. Russia has overstepped every reasonable boundary. Teach Russia a lesson, and China, at least, will learn from it.

Naturally the overhead bins were full, and they were having us gate check our carryons. I checked mine, and the guy behind me after scanning his boarding pass shoved past me yelling ""nope! I'm not doing it."" He was yelling and screaming at the gate agent. I hesitated at the door to the plane in case this psycho got violent with the 60 year old lady checking the bags. But a moment later a few male employess larger than myself showed up and the police were on their way so I got on board. Overheard the flight attendants say he was banned for life from the airline. 

All that over checking in a bag, what's more is I heard a more reasonable person say they were catching a connecting flight to Paris and really needed that bag as a carry-on for their connecting flight and the airline was able to work something out for them. but this asshole went from 0 to batshit with no warning.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Yeah it really is insane how some people’s brains have changed over the nearly 5 years since Covid now. 

I think it’s just a bunch of weird things happening at a bad time. Influenza is considered the last “major pandemic” before Covid; and it didn’t even hold a candle to Covid’s worldwide outreach and the mass hysteria that followed as a response. It’s also the first huge pandemic to happen after the uprise in smartphones and social media; combine that with the fact that all of this just so happen to line up with the next election; one which has an already established cult personality and extremist ideologies and the other bordering on dementia and total incompetence and you have recipe for disaster.

Through social media; people petaled the idea that Covid was a huge lie and scandal by the US government as an excuse to control the population. So in this time of crisis; where the government built by the people, for the people; what’s to do its job and do what it SHOULD do, and HELP end the crisis by taking preventive measures and precautions; people take that as “YOU DICTATORS AIN’T TAKING MY RIGHTS AWAY”. So this insane group of people thought they were gonna be revolutionaries and overthrow a tyrannical government when in reality; they were defying a perfectly reasonable government trying its best in a time of crisis. 

Then trump got more unhinged; his followers listened and you could write an entire book about how unhinged he is. Elon bought twitter, turned it into an algorithmic nightmare of anti- semitism, racism, anti-intellectualism and general xenophobia. 

While children get their minds rotted away by algorithms, so do fully grown adults; everyday, people just get more and more sucked into varying false realities and sludges of misinformation; hyper reality turning people more and more into what is effectively a caricature of the people they watch and listen to all day; like Trump, Tucker, Alex jones, etc. And the anti-intellectualism of these individuals trickles right back down to the viewers. 

Many People don’t stop and think “wait this guy is just being racist” they subconsciously absorb and agree with these people like they are literal gods and keepers of all that is true and “Fighters against the lies that THEY don’t want you to know” whoever “They” is. 

And it’s not like you can just ignore these people either unfortunately because their actions have real consequences on all the reasonable folks in the US and likely similar effects around the world with different talking heads spouting equal or worse rhetoric. 

The end result is a world full of people turning into entitled and radicalized zombies; most sense of former personality erased; “now exist to serve my conservative anti-vax, xenophobic overlords; must obey, must storm capital, must take guillotine, and bring it to capital, must obey orange man, must obey Tucker;
Alex Jones is always right too”

Meanwhile, even folks outside of the politically obsessed become more unhinged by the day as well. People want to confirm their biases or feel entitled to certain things and so you have people that are like “Ladies, if your man doesn’t buy you Starbucks everyday, he ain’t worthy of you” or incel groups of men that gather together and form a collective hatred of women.

Effectively, we’re just now in the part of the Information Age where we’re seeing this radical shift in culture and how people perceive the world around them; for some it creates a positive difference; such as people realizing and coming together to say that it’s okay to be gay/bi/trans, etc. to say that racism is bad, to say that “Traditional values” has become a dog whistle for hate and discrimination. 

Meanwhile, on the other end of the stick; you have people who say the exact opposite; that “everyone I don’t like is bad” that “all those WOKE people are weird”, etc.

The end result; pure chaos!",2024_11_06,05_05_54

It’s not me, I go out of my way to be brief and use simple language. but it’s like some people aren’t processing, some people tune out if you say more than three words and some people seem like they’re doing both.

They’re like a slow mouse trying a maze for the first time, but that maze is 3 feet tall and made out of stanchions and ropes. 

It’s not like I kept track of human behavior before and after the pandemic with detailed notes. Instead it’s a feeling in my gut that something is very wrong. Part of it could’ve been the lockdowns reducing in person, communication and exposure to the outside world, part of it is brain damage from unvaccinated people who got Covid, part of it is the sheer amount of people on benzodiazepines and marijuana.

The government influencing Hurricanes, Haitians eating pets, the COVID vaccine kills people, WiFi and other bands of EMR used for communication causing cancer, GMOs being harmful, all the shit about FEMA, school shootings being faked with crisis actors, the Super Bowl was rigged so Taylor Swift's boyfriend would win.

Don't believe the unbridled enthusiasm since Harris accepted the nomination.

As much as +9 for Republicans choosing Harris.

There is no way you can go from a healthy loss in 2020, lose a ton of voters, run the shittiest campaign in modern history, have your opponent's campaign with enthusiastic voters like Harris does... and have a shot.

  
Pollsters do not like being wrong and make corrections so it doesn't repeat. I think pollsters are skewing towards Trump to avoid the polling errors of the past, while the things they missed are now in Harris's favor. How else can a Senate candidate be way ahead w/ Harris only +3 in the same state? Harris has a +5 approval to Trump's -18.

So in that universe, how on earth do you model ""likely voters"" with any confidence whatsoever?

So the supporters will never be moved to dislike Trump due to his own statements. It’s the potential supporters who can still be moved (think non-convinced Puerto Ricans and “garbage island” and compare it to committed Jews being told it will be their “fault” if Trump looses.

I just talked to my wife and she said her MAGA dad just talked to her, saying that she should get her news from “independent” sources and that Elon Musk and RFK Jr. would be incredible for our country and all of this shit.  She answered back by saying that none of that is true and gave him all of the examples of why they would be bad, either quoting stuff that Trump has said about them that would be actively bad for all of us, or quoting the words they have said themselves.

His response?  “It’s all AI.  None of it is true.  It’s very easy to fake them saying those things.”  For fuck’s sake, they SAY these things out loud themselves.  If you don’t trust the words they have spewed on social media because you doubt written text online, then watch the fucking videos in which they have said this stuff out loud.  I have watched more videos of Trump rallies than I care to admit but it’s because of that that I know how wholly unserious he is as a candidate and why he is so dangerous at the same time as a result.

A public not being complacent about voting is a small advantage. It is far, far outweighed by the world having to endure years deep anxiety about if the most powerful country in the world, *the* archetype of a nuclear power, will continue hobbling along or tip into fascism. If you don't care to imagine the harm that does to American citizens, imagine how that feels for American allies. Imagine how that feels for Ukrainians who have to wait for the US to get its shit together every 4 years to know if we will help shield against Putin or turn our backs. 

The Japanese public is famously apathetic about voting, and it results in a moderate ruling party that is uninspiring and has deep problems with bribery.

"I am on your side here but I keep trying to remind myself that this is not 2016 and VP Harris is not Secretary Clinton.

In 2016 Trump was an unknown quantity, politically speaking. It was impossible to predict just how chaotic and terrible his presidency would be simply because we’d never seen anything like it before. “During a pandemic he helped exacerbate, the president will deny the results of an election and order his supporters to storm the Capitol” would have sounded like bad thriller fiction in 2016.

In contrast, Clinton (who I voted for) was an incredibly well-known quantity, and a lot of people genuinely disliked her, in large part because the GOP had been demonizing her for literally decades. She may have been the most uniquely qualified person to hold the job of President in my lifetime, but she was a poor candidate/campaigner and took a lot of things for granted. Plus she was kind of the ultimate establishment figure, which can be (and was) a turnoff for certain voters, a fact which was made all the worse by Trump’s outsider status.

Harris has made none of the mistakes Clinton did- she’s been campaigning her ass off- and is not nearly so well-known and long-tenured a national political figure as to be instinctively disliked by undecideds or people who are wary of “the establishment.” And she is running against a version of Trump whose outsider appeal is gone, and who is in fact now all-too-familiar to many voters- he was a terrible President just four years ago, and has been an exhausting drain on the nation’s psyche in the four years since.

I share your concerns, I really do, and maybe I’m saying all this to reassure myself as anything else. But the situation now and the situation eight years ago are night and day different.

That was before J6 and before Trump doubled down on all the same, and in many cases, worse rhetoric that made the gap between 2016 and 2020 so large. I would be very surprised if Kamala doesn’t have Trump beat by well over 10m votes, if not 15m or 20m.

Scientific calculations typically use SI units like newtons, but ton-force is commonly used in rocketry because it's practical for discussing large thrust numbers:

\- This rocket needs 1,961,330 newtons of thrust  
\- This rocket needs 2000 ton force of thrust

In engineering, it's common to approximate gravity to 10 for quick mental math, especially in real time discussions. Nobody is dividing by 9.81 in their heads.

The advantages of using ton-force is that it roughly has a 1:1 ratio to the mass in tons. A 200 ton rocket needs about 200 ton force to lift. This makes it more intuitive for quick discussions than dealing with these gigantic newton values.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

No, not a miracle, and it's somewhat insulting and irritating to frame it in that particular way. Like it or not, dems were absolutely the classic ""party in disarray"" - Biden was a great president, but not a good candidate. THe other side spent a lot on very successfully presenting him as a total failure, as a weak old man, and somehow the worst president we ever had as the best possible option. Kamala Harris was the deep exhale dems needed, and even in the first days clever analysts pointed out the unstoppable momentum of a deeply relieved electorate. Changes have clearly been made, a younger guard has been handed the reins of the DNC, and they absolutely smashed this out of the park - brilliant strategy, seizing on that need for change, and goddamnit Kamala Harris makes me feel like Obama did - smart, human, reassuring as hell, with a running mate who only stoked the fire. It's not a miracle, it's a razor sharp strategy. I'm not celebrating, I'm scared as fuck and I hate it, but I have felt more optimism and hope in the last 90-something days than Ive felt since \~2012. 

We can only hope. The chaos is going to be infuriating. If the coup is successful, I as a gay man with guns have no idea what I'm going to do, but I know there will be bitter, frustrated tears. There's gonna be tears either way, I hope they're from the joy and pride of my country electing a nonwhite woman of character like we rarely see.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"It would have been so much better if Biden hadn't run a second time at all. 

Honestly, Kamala probably wouldn't be the candidate. It would have been a young white guy. 

Which, given the amount of sexism and racism in this country, would probably be much easier for the Democrats to win this election.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"I would argue that she did regardless. Granted being in the position of ""Not Trump"" sure helped a lot in her 3 month campaign.

The political process in itself is just as ridiculous as the election. The fact that she's made it through that, and this quickly, is a miracle. 

The win would be a 2nd miracle imo. I know the stakes, but discrediting the intense lead up to this is disingenuous.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"This is just wrong, Harris would have never made it out of the primaries with the campaign she's running. The only reason it's better is because Biden sucked and should have stuck to being a one term president like he said he was going to.

We need to shorten the cycle to 90 days total. People campaigning for 2 years is exhausting - first the primary and then the general. It starts right after the mid terms wrap which is preceded by 1 year of campaigning stuff. We only get like a 12 month break.,2024_11_06,05_05_54

"There’s no earthly reason to have primaries in January.  But literally no one can control the states in their race to the bottom.

Here’s a Bipartisan idea for Election Day: Screw the Early states.  Iowa and New Hampshire suck and shouldn’t be allowed to hijack our political system out of tradition.

Order the Primaries by voter turnout.  The greater the turnout the earlier a state is allowed to hold a primary.  Greater turnout equals a more engaged electorate, demonstrating that a state deserves earlier priority.  It also encourages voter turnout both for self interested reasons and applies a negative stimulus to states with low turnout.

For example Primary Voters in Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia would have to wait to be last.  Something which might actually encourage lawmakers to increase turnout.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

So his groundwork and good will for the Democratic Party has really helped people be ready for more democratic leadership.

"Agreed. And as much as I think she did moderately ok, most of the turn around is based on Trump being absolutely the worst fucking candidate of all time bar Hillary. Any Republican would have won this race in a landslide. Yes, even the complete fuckwits, which is most of them. 

The Democrats still have a lot to learn if they want to get young men back on their side and it is totally possible. Remember that the policies the Dems support are massively popular among all demographics. They just still happen to fuck it up. 

Elections should be default wins for Dems until Republicans pull hard back to the left. That they aren’t shows just how incompetent they are with messaging. Obama cooked everyone. 

He’s not a freak outlier. He’s what Dems should all be like. I mean literally running Jon Stewart would have resulted in a 45 state landslide.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

In just glad it seems like they’ve thrown out the old tired playbook for campaigning. They did so much to appeal to younger voters and use media in a more relevant way.

"It was a good campaign but I wouldn't call it perfect. They had a ton of energy and momentum up until the DNC and then it started to really fade. That's also coincidentally when the messaging room a hard turn toward the ""safer"" option. They stopped using ""Were not going back"" and completely distanced themselves from the ""They're Weird"" messaging which I thought was a bad choice. I would have preferred for her to keep up that same direction and also more radically distance herself from Biden. She was too protective of him the entire campaign. 

My guess is that at the DNC, the old guard came in and started advising her to run a campaign more like Bidens 2020 campaign which did not work as well for her. If she ran a more aggressive campaign or ran a more ""it's time for change"" campaign like Obamas 2008 campaign, I think she'd be way farther ahead.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

That’s what Democrats needed: someone who was going to punch Trump and the GOP right back in the mouth.

So yes, the Harris-Trump was so cathartic for me after the visceral fear I felt watching Biden crash earlier in the summer. She EMASCULATED him, shattered the macho alpha male facade that enabled more men to feel more comfortable supporting a woman.

Also: we do need to give credit to Hillary. Like Obama she was a trailblazer who planted the seed that having a female president was not only possible, but ultimately inevitable. And on that angle, the one thing about her I’m so thankful for: she didn’t highlight her gender as part of her campaign, glass-ceiling and what not. There were no feminist undertones to her campaign.

"I’ve been saying this for ages. Biden planned it ages ago. Perfectly timed it so that the perfect balance between risk and reward could be executed and Kamala could get rocketed into the fight. He surprised his enemy in the oldest grand move in war, by leading a relatively docile Trump into an ambush and then calling in Captain Marvel and executing a pincer movement. Like as far as cinematic historical events go, Kamala’s rapid assent to the forefront of the resistance against Trump is like Gandalf the White arriving on Helm’s Deep or Han Solo blasting Darth Vader off course to let Luke blow up the Death Star. Biden is famous for his political mastery and bargaining- a lot of Obama’s best successes in his tenure are owed in part to the amount of support and leverage afforded by Biden’s strategies - and even with the pressure for him to resign, he outwitted Pelosi’s own machinations to have an open election (not that she’s complaining). Joe Biden is one of the most selfless and wise presidents in modern United States history. I truly hope he is one day recognized as such.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

And to be fair, people just straight bailed on Biden and were shitty to him.

I think what really sunk Biden was the 24/7 news coverage about him having to step down when Trump did the same and nothing was said about him. And the fact that every mistake, however small, was amplified x10. 

Then of course, on the other hand, we needed someone to meet the moment and be able to handle Trump. We needed someone that could, as Harris has done, spar and win against Trump during a debate. Biden seemed to be unable to do so.

But as I understand it, when you get old, it hits you really fast sometimes. Biden seemingly declined quickly from the SOTU to the debate.

Joe's entire vibe is ""a casual conversation"", which amounts to an agreement that nobody will push back on anything the other person says in any meaningful way. He's an unserious person, and this works great for unserious candidates like Trump and Vance. They were able to spew bullshit the entire time, with Rogan listening intently. 

For the Democrats though, who believe in facts and objective reality, they wouldn't be able to just sit there and let Rogan cite nonsense, therefore the interview is instantly gonna have a contentious vibe by comparison. Rogan's listeners' takeaway would be ""Trump was able to hang, but Kamala argued the whole time"".

I want to keep being your President.""

The very notion that this was somehow planned out from the beginning feels like Monday-Morning Quarterbacking to the nth degree. The entire Dem Party was preparing for the worst, for Biden to take his campaign all the way to election day, but instead he swallowed his pride and stepped down. Not only did he do it early enough that the party was able to then take the critical steps of solidifying behind Harris, but it was all still while he was probably still in his heart hurting from admitting that he was no longer up to the task of leading this country.

The amount of division between people has become so large some people view everything through a political lens. 

Short of avoiding people with conflicting views entirely which means trimming down your friend and family group by half so you exist in an echo chamber (a problem of its own), politics are inescapable.

It’s sickening to see people who say they read and believe the same Bible I do not only refuse to denounce Trump but endorse his candidacy.
I’m supporting Harris because she’s a person of good character, with integrity, leads with love, and is someone who can be trusted. Oh, and she can pass a background check, unlike Trump, with his numerous adulterous affairs, his multiple felony convictions, his race-baiting, his violent rhetoric, his repeated lies, and his not resembling Christ or His church in ANY way.”

"It wasn’t dismissed. It was an emergency petition that was denied, requesting to cease the raffle/sweepstakes, which was moot because the remaining winners were already selected and were not in PA.

Rest assured, actual criminal charges will be forthcoming, especially since they admitted to it being rigged. But the merits of whether it was an illegal lottery or election fraud were not adjudicated. That was strictly a request for an emergency injunction to stop the giveaways.

Musk still has lots of legal exposure here, but there was very little the judge could do. Not as if he had any authority as a state judge in PA to stop Musk from giving away money in other states.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

I have a gay friend who’s switching from Biden to Trump over the economy, and know several young dudes who didn’t bother to vote in 2020 but are now swoon by Trump’s brand of ‘masculinity’. Two of my friends white mothers voted for Biden and now are repeating the same maga talking points about Kamala. This is all in a swing state btw. And the rise of tailored algorithms and tradwife/manosphere content since 2020 has captured a lot of low information voters’ attention. People have the memory of goldfish. Remember how we all hated 2016 and now it’s nostalgic? The same applies to Trump’s presidency. The question is will this be enough to counteract those showing up or switching blue for Roe?

"Not much. In terms of new voters he, at best, has a handful of new latino, black, and Muslim voters swayed by his nominal appeals to social conservatism, plus the Greens and Libertarians who gave up pretending they weren't Russian assets.

IMO it's nowhere near enough to replace what he lost from COVID, the end of Roe, the exposure of Project 2025, and his stance on Ukraine and NATO post-2022 invasion.

It just wasn't a ""statistically solid"" analysis. Simply put, there was reason to think the analysis we did could be wrong, so the media didn't cover it. They waited until there was multiple ""strong"" indicators before calling the election, which was a very good idea for them to be cautious. Getting something like that wrong is really bad.

">The 2020 election was not very close in hindsight. Biden won by a very significant margin.

From your link (emphasis added):

>If Biden's three narrowest state victories—Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona, all of which he won by less than a percentage point—had gone to Trump, there would have been a tie of 269 electors for each candidate,[^(\[320\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-tippingpointstate-334)[^(\[321\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-Skelley-538-335) causing a [contingent election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_election) to be decided by the House of Representatives, where Trump had the advantage. (Even though Democrats controlled the House, contingent elections are determined by state delegations in which each state receives just one vote, and since a slight majority of states in 2020 contained more Republican than Democratic representatives, Republicans would have had more votes in such an election.) **This scenario would have required a popular-vote shift of 0.63% or less in each of these three states, a total of about 43,000 votes, 0.03% of votes cast nationally.**

Due to the electoral college, the margin of victory was only 43k votes, or 0.03%. If you want to consider electoral college only as the margin of victory, you could theoretically win every single state/district by a single vote and have a complete clearing of all 538 electoral votes...while only sweeping the entire 100% of the electoral college while on a razor thin edge of a little over 50 people's ballots. 

If we want to consider popular vote only as the margin of victory, you can imagine a scenario where 100% of all people in every single blue state vote democrat and the republican wins every red state and those three states above by only tiny margins. Then you'd end up with the democrats winning the popular vote 65% to 35% and still losing the electoral college and thus the election.

So your position is that an electoral vote win margin of 74 is significant, no? Then a 74 electoral vote margin of victory is always a significant margin of victory, no? Then hypotheticals are not irrelevant if that is how you have defined your words, it must be consistent and any hypothetical scenario where the margin of victory is 74 electoral votes should also be considered ""significant"". 

>You can't keep transfering back and forth between the popular vote counts and the electoral counts to make your talking point work

The popular votes in each state determines where the electoral votes of that state go. It is thus essential to consider the popular votes in certain states when looking at where the electoral vote margin landed. They are related.

If you agree that the popular votes in each states determines the electoral counts and that you have defined an electoral victory of 306-232 as ""significant, then let us imagine a hypothetical scenario that is far fetched but certainly not outside the realm of possibilities. 

California currently has 54 electoral votes. Can we not imagine a scenario that by the next census there's been a mass exodus of people from various red states to California, and the electoral votes have been redistributed away from those states and now California has 74 electoral votes. In 1964, California only had 32 electoral votes, so this isn't a crazy stretch. If California is the tipping point state, the winner of California will have won the electoral college by 74 points, 306-232, the same margin as Biden in 2020. By your definition, this would be considered a ""significant margin of victory"".

Now, the only place we disagree, is by the very virtue of your same logic in 2020, you are also saying that in this hypothetical scenario of someone winning the electoral college by 74 points, that it does not matter if that person won California by only a single vote (the popular vote margin in that state). I am saying that by my logic, winning California and thus those 74 electoral votes by only 1 single vote is an extremely thin margin of victory, regardless of how many electoral votes or popular nation wide votes that person has.

This has nothing to do with cherry picking data in hindsight. It is merely taking the logic by which you choose your words and applying that same logic to other scenarios and seeing if the conclusion is still logical. There's a reason there's an entire paragraph dedicated to this razor thin margin on that wikipedia article, and this was widely talked about at the time.

I posit that my hypothetical of winning California by 1 vote and still having the 74 electoral college margin vs the reality of those 43k votes across 3 states also having 74 electoral points are not such a huge difference when we're talking about 160 million votes. This is not some absurd cherry picking of data that some random person on reddit pulled out of thin air on hindsight, it was the entire backbone of Trumps illegal pressuring of vote fixing in those three states.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

">I am saying that by my logic, winning California and thus those 74 electoral votes by only 1 single vote is an extremely thin margin of victory, regardless of how many electoral votes or popular nation wide votes that person has. 

The presidential election is not determined by the voters. It's determined by the electoral college. You keep mixing things up and now you're suggesting that I am illogical...

You're also aruging about what the word significant means now... Which is super silly because it doesn't really mean all that much. It just means a ""significant amount"" in whatever the context is. In your own example, a single vote could be considered ""significant"" if it led to the state being won.

I don't know what the point of this conversation is. I really don't.

This is reddit. If you don't agree, use the downvote button and move on... I don't want to read giant blocks of text nit picking stuff I said and I don't think anybody on here does. So, I don't know what you're doing. I've been wrong before, it's not that big of a deal dude.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"The irony of MAGA putting on horse(ivermectin)-blinders for Leon and not seeing that his essence is a virulent Soros swamp archetype that they complained about for so long, is beyond me. But hey he’s their guy and not all is fair in love and war.

If Trump wins, how long till they turn on Leon? Better yet, when Theil and Musk oust dementia riddled Trump for Vance, who will the MAGA loyalists side with? I can’t imagine that Trump’s malignant narcissism will allow his perceived legacy to be ruined by the 25th amendment being pulled on him. 

I have faith that regardless of the election outcome, the rat filled MAGA ship is taking on water and even the fat rats are forgetting how to swim. For evil to fail, all good men have to do is nothing…",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Jokes aside, this pairing of two genuinely despicable humans is indicative of what a horrible backslide we've been in for pretty much the entirety of the postmodern era.

“As an Evangelical Christian, I’ve voted Republican for 40 years. The Republican Party I knew and loved would have never chosen as its nominee the adulterous, childish, habitually lying and criminally convicted Trump. It’s sickening to see people who say they read and believe the same Bible I do not only refuse to denounce Trump but endorse his candidacy.
I’m supporting Harris because she’s a person of good character, with integrity, leads with love, and is someone who can be trusted. Oh, and she can pass a background check, unlike Trump, with his numerous adulterous affairs, his multiple felony convictions, his race-baiting, his violent rhetoric, his repeated lies, and his not resembling Christ or His church in ANY way.”

No matter how grandiose, how well-planned, how apparently foolproof of an evil plan, the inherent sinfulness will by definition rebound upon its instigators. No matter how apparently successful it may seem upon the way, at the end it will wreck itself. It will founder upon the rocks of iniquity and sink headfirst to vanish without trace into the seas of oblivion.""

"> Kacsmaryk ordered the department to confirm “no observers” would be present in polling locations in Texas, but the judge did not issue a restraining order. **The judge’s action was docketed just minutes after Paxton’s office dropped its request for such an order, having reached its agreement with the Justice Department**.


> **Under the agreement, the department’s election monitors will remain outside of polling and central count locations** and be subject to Texas law regarding electioneering within 100 feet (30 meters) of those locations.


> **Paxton in a statement called the agreement a victory that ensures that Justice Department personnel cannot enter Texas election locations.**


Paxton ultimately got the outcome he wanted, no federal election monitors are allowed to enter Texas election locations where polling takes place and counting happens. Fuckery is still on the table.

"DOVER, Del. — U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester defeated Republican Eric Hansen in Delaware’s U.S. Senate race on Tuesday.

Blunt Rochester will become the first woman and first Black person to represent Delaware in the Senate. Only three other [Black women](https://apnews.com/article/election-senate-harris-black-women-maryland-54c411e0a0f4d3d84de95246b09be304) have served in the Senate, two of them elected and one who was appointed.

Rochester was considered a virtual shoo-in for the Senate against businessman Hansen, a political newcomer. Democrats hold a significant voter registration advantage over Republicans in solid-blue Delaware, which last sent a Republican to Washington in 2008.

Rochester raised some $8 million for her Senate campaign, while Hansen’s campaign receipts totaled only about $1 million, including more than $800,000 in loans he made to his campaign.
