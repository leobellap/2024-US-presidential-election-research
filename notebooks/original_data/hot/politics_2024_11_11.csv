"Best thing Trump can do is to just let current policies play out, and claim the credits for those. Impose a few inconsequential tariffs, throw out some illegal immigrants, and launch a PR campaign around those. His voters would eat it right up, and claim declare a huge victory. 

After that he can pretty much retire to the golf course, while other people are packing the courts. 

But I suspect he's so fixated on tariffs that he can't see straight. I figure that with China going to a debt crisis, Trump imagines he can strong-arm China into unfavorable trade deal. If China calls his bluff or injures his ego, he could very well start a full-scale trade war - just for spite. 

Same with immigration. It's one of those policies that he can enact by a pen stroke, without being actively part of it - all the policing will be handled locally. If/when local police won't cooperate with him, he'll feel offended and lash out on those states. 

It's a damn shame that so much of the upcoming Trump policies hinge on his day-to-day mood, and whether or not his ego has been bruised.

Perhaps if the minimum wage was raised to a living wage indexed to inflation, then taxing tips might be less petty, punishing, and humiliating. It was always bullshit.

An intentional default of the US would likely mark the end of the modern economy and US hegemony. It would spark the largest global depression in history. 

I am being grave serious when I promise you we would never see the US as a global superpower - or even a regional power - again. 

It's not just that the interest rates are higher. The vast majority of global trade is denoted in USD because it's the safest store of wealth in the globe. The Federal Reserve would no longer be able to fund the FDIC or the NCUSIF (the credit union equivalent). This will cause massive bank panics. 

The Federal government would no longer be able to fund at any level beyond the most minimal options. We wouldn't be able to afford to maintain the social programs, park system, regulatory body, or even the US military. 

Ever realize how rarely we hear about cargo ships getting hijacked, confiscated, stolen, blown up, etc.? That's because the US Navy protects the global waters for trade. We'll even put soldiers on those cargo ships or provide escorts to protect them if necessary, even if they're foreign ships coming to and going from foreign ports. We'd no longer be able to do so. 

Global trade is denoted in USD. Why? Because the dollar is backed by the US government and Treasury bills. These are considered the safest store of wealth in the globe. The US has never defaulted, it's a liquid cash equivalent, it's predictable, and it's quite literally used as the definition of ""risk-free return"".

"> But Democrats need to realize that they have less a policy problem than a propaganda problem, one that is evident in both the messages the parties send and the systems through which information is delivered. If Democrats can figure out how to do something about that, they‚Äôll be less likely to find themselves in the position they are now.

Gee, I wonder if maybe [this mentality](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/democrats-face-defining-2020-question-does-defeating-trump-outweigh-all-n999251?cid=sm_npd_ms_tw_ma) had anything to do with this issue.

From 2020 article:

>Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said the number of Democrats who say their top priority is electability or defeating Trump is at ‚Äúrecord highs,‚Äù at 38 percent to 41 percent in recent polling.

>‚ÄúIt beats everything else. It beats values by 3-to-1. It beats character by 10 points,‚Äù Lake said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never had it that high before.‚Äù

And later:

> Biden, as he launched his campaign, staked his candidacy on stopping Trump from winning a second term that he warned would ‚Äúforever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.‚Äù Yet some Democrats took note that there was little mention about what he would do affirmatively with his years in the Oval Office, other than undo the previous four.

Biden naively campaigned in 2020 with the misguided belief that he was the only one who could end Trump's reign on the principle that making Trump go away would just magically make things better and snap his supporters back to reality. He wanted to turn a blind eye to the ugliness and persistence of fascism and sold a pipe dream to people who would be told four difficult years of recovery later, ""No, this time it really is the most important election of our lifetime!"" While arguably true, it rang on deaf ears.

This time we had a discouraged voter base that was primed against the incumbent as well as a Donald Trump who seemed invincible against consequences thanks to his cronies on the Supreme Court and in Congress. Biden could have given us a chance to hold Trump accountable, but in a political ploy of pure pretentiousness, he appointed spineless centrist Merrick Garland as AG, killing any chances to keep his one primary vow to Americans.

So yeah, Biden was the victim of undue blame. But whether it was his choice of AG or his unwillingness to drop out of an unfavorable race earlier, Biden has his own stubbornness to blame for providing the recipe for the Democrats' defeat.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

>""Average wages went up enough to cover high grocery prices""

Okay that means that a little under half of the people in the country DIDN'T get raises to cover the price increases, and those who DID get those are sitting there saying ""Great, I finally got a raise, and all it did was bring me back to where I was. what a fucking waste.""

Effective monopolies are taking over, profit seeking is turning every part of life to absolute shit, the extremely wealthy have completely corrupted our entire society, the right is increasingly pushing us towards concentration camps and civil war, and Democrats don't even have a whisper of an answer for any of this.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"Reposting here: It's the economy, stupid. That's why Democrats/Harris lost (and Biden not dropping out farther in advance). For all the macro econ numbers that look good, people's underlying wallets do not look good for working class Americans, and we have the same structural issues with the economy today that we've had for decades. In that scenario, incumbents can lose. Trump may be completely a charlatan, horrible in many ways, and un-serious about addressing these issues, but his rhetoric is populist economically. The messaging is key. His populist rhetoric cuts through, and the Democrats have a lack of messaging/outreach that can match.

For instance, think back to 2022 when inflation was raging. If Trump were president, he would have been shouting 24/7 scapegoating corporations, greedy boards/ceos, and throwing everyone and anyone elitist under the bus he could. Biden on the other hand was tone deaf and blase; almost completely absent in general (and aside from just the messaging/narratives, he should have actually done something with emergency COVID powers to rein in price gouging, even if courts tried to stop him).

Democrats never should have tried to pass off the economy as ""good;"" instead they should have said they're a recovery admin, insisted they're still cleaning up the Republicans mess throughout Biden's term, acknowledged people's finances, and pointed the finger at Republicans plus Corporations/Wall St. for out of control price gouging.

Going forward, they need to simplify the message and platform, and get big and bold. The power of three. should promote these three exclusively as their party platform going forward:

\- ""We're going to raise taxes on the wealthy and specifically dedicate those funds solely to maintaining and expanding Social Security and Medicare, and nothing else""

\- ""The era of the government and our party catering to Corporations and Wall St is over. We will rein in Corporate and Wall St dominance of our government and give a voice to working Americans and small business.""

""We're going all in for working Americans and small business, and will address their needs, particularly by reining in the costs of housing, healthcare, prescription drugs, education, and childcare.""",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"No? I mean by most economic metrics things are looking better.. except poverty and food insecurity are both going up. Inflation is falling but prices are not, or at least not by much. Wages are up, especially for working class Americans, but in no way have they kept up with rent and inflation. 

Voters punished Biden primarily for economic reasons because they weren't really feeling the benefits of the great economy, especially working class people. They also just thought he was old and because he was old he did a terrible job messaging his own accomplishments (something Dems seem to never really do). Also, because he was old he never seemed like he was fighting for anything. He attempted to fix the issue with the railroad strikes by doing backroom deals.. but never took any sort of ownership of the gains there (though they weren't really what was being asked for). 

Dems suck at making their case. They are out of touch technocratic elites mostly. I mean for Trumps endless faults, he is pretty much what he appears to be and has little real pretense. He is authentically a piece of shit. 

As to all the people blaming voters instead of leadership.. I mean you can do that if it makes you feel better, and certainly every Trump voter or apathetic non-voter takes some blame, but generally its pointless to do so. Each voter has next to no power individually. Its more constructive to point at the people with actual power and ask them to do their jobs better (or better yet replace the oldsters). 

Biden shares an insane amount of blame here, not merely because he was too old and out of touch to communicate is good policies, but also because he setup this entire situation with Kamala. You can go back to his reasoning to picking her, or what sort of jobs he gave her to do as VP, or just the fact it took him so long to step down after implying heavily he would be a one term president.

"DUH!

Man... 

The disinformation machine was hard at work. They did it. The radical far-right convinced millions that Biden was a failure and that he messed up the economy.... when in fact, so much of it was Trump and the pandemic.

1. Trump ran rough-shod over the economy right from the start. Obama's economic recovery was strong enough to withstand it, for a couple of years... but the stresses began to show. And then the pandemic hit.

2. Not only was the economy undermined enough to be vulnerable to the consequences of the pandemic shut downs, but Trump failed to do anything at all to help protect the supply chain in the USA. ZERO.

3. Trump had the US oil production system stopped by the request of Saudi Arabia. And with the pandemic finally being mitigated enough for industry to get moving again, oil production was so badly stalled... and that caused gas prices to soar.

4. Because of how badly things got, stimulus payments were needed to keep people going. Otherwise there'd have been a total collapse. Biden had to do it. And it was the right thing to do.

All of this amounted to inflation being seeded... that blossomed during Biden's term. High gas prices. High food prices... and Biden was blamed for all of it. But it wasn't his fault.

  
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA completely failed us. They did not counter the disinformation sufficiently. Partly because the far-right media outlets perpetuated the disinformation. Really traitorous, what they did.

> This is what the Democratic Party does; it's who they are.  They're willing to feign support for anything their voters want just as long as there's no chance that they can pass it.  They won control of Congress in the 2006 midterm elections by pretending they wanted to compel an end to the Iraq War and Bush surveillance and interrogation abuses because they knew they would not actually do so; and indeed, once they were given the majority, the Democratic-controlled Congress continued to fund the war without conditions, to legalize Bush's eavesdropping program, and to do nothing to stop Bush's habeas and interrogation abuses (""Gosh, what can we do?

There is also the misconception that high prices would go down when inflation drops. The business world understood very quickly that people would not be paying for the new normal prices that lowering them would be a senseless move from a profits point of view. 

No one knows what to expect in the coming 4 years, but if Trump gets his way and implements the policies he touted during his campaign, this may backfire incredibly hard for the people who voted for him.

If Trump was president under the same circumstances there wouldn't be the same backlash on the economy. Democrats thus have to figure out how to push their own narratives to the people they need to push them to, to win elections. 

I don't think it helps that Biden was old and the narrative the dominated the news for a long time was his age. This was a legitimate concern and it's also true Biden should have probably stated he would be a one term president from the beginning of his presidency or way sooner than he actually did.

Biden was a good president in so far as he got a lot of good things done and managed everything very effectively. He was a bad president in his ability to actually communicate this.

"Yes, but only junkies of politics watch MSNBC.   The viewership is much different than Fox which captures a bigger share of its viewership.  The left also panics a lot where those on the right say, I don't care what Trump does, cheat on his wife, threaten war, calling his opponent low IQ, spreading conspiracies, even shooting someone, they will vote for him, no matter what.

The left want their candidates to do something which involves something besides hate.   Muslims who didn't care for Biden not siding with those being killed in Gaza due to the US historical support of Israel.   Even if the decision to punish Biden meant they would get something worse, they felt like they were being ignored even if the result is they will be ignored even more, but at least, they had some hopes Biden could do something and wouldn't and were indifferent to Trump doing nothing and basically knowing, he would support Israel.

There isn't a good equivalent of how the right communicates with its base on the left side.  The left base doesn't watch MSNBC.  They don't consume left media.   Only those that follow politics a lot care.  All that shilling that Trump does with MAGA swag was another tool to show loyalty to Trump.   Although he is fleecing his own base, they seem not to care, and wear MAGA clothing with pride.  Trump became a cult of personality that the left won't (and shouldn't) consider.

The one hope is that Trump is a singular personality and the right can't produce anyone that will come close to being like a cult leader.  Trump had denigrated his competition and the Republican primary was a sham with most unwilling to challenge Trump for fear it would impact their chances.

Or, oddly enough, maybe there's hope that JD Vance is more like the person he was before he became senator and that once Trump goes away, he might be able to be that person (but feels highly unlikely).  His charisma just doesn't seem to resonate and neither do most of the competition.  As fiery as Chris Christie was, I mean, things like his weigh probably negatively impacted him, and he was probably seen as a traitor to Trump, but he was easily ignored by Trump who ignored all his competition to the point of their irrelevance (esp. Vivek who really didn't seem he had a good reason to run).",2024_11_11,17_08_15

If you are working class, this statement is laughable.

So economists and pundits need to stop the tut tutting about why the poors can't be happy when the poors aren't seeing the price of milk go down. Or their wages going up.

Inflation from covid isn't Biden's fault, and he did work to put the brakes on inflation. But being president is not just doing things behind the scenes. You need to project authority and confidence and have a *plan* moving forward. Biden has spent the last two or so years hiding out, and when he was finally trotted out it was a disaster.

---

Before I go any further, i want to make it clear that I don't credit Trump with any of the shit I'm about to mention. The only credit Trump gets from me is credit for fucking up the COVID response not just for us, but worldwide, and for the more than a million Americans that died because of it. 

The point of this comment is to explain why people thought the economy was great then and why they think it's shit now. 

---

Those bailouts we the people got were amazing. For those of us who were working, wages were pretty high. For those of us that were unemployed, unemployment was all but guaranteed and it was super high. In Texas right now the maximum unemployment is $591, during COVID it was $1135 because of the extra $600(max was $535 in 2020). For a lot of people, that was more money than they were making at work. Right now, the maximum in Mississippi is $235. Same as it was in 2020. That extra $600 would have been a goddamn lifesaver. 

If you could also get food stamps, that was another couple hundred dollars or more per month. 

Rent was lower, and pretty much everything was waaaaay cheaper. Especially gas, which dipped all the way down to $1 per gallon in at least one Texas town. So all that extra money went even further than it does now. 

After the pandemic, wages eventually crashed back down. At least they did for my industry. The extra $600 for unemployment ended. Unemployment became harder to get again. And then the price of everything shot through the roof. 

When people talk about the economy, they don't care about the stock market, thats not what they're talking about. They're talking about how they're personally doing financially. And for a lot of people, how they're doing now is shit, especially compared to the pandemic. 

They credit Trump because they're brain dead, they blame Biden for the same reason.

"Since 2008, Democrats never had as much of a chance to push most of their policies. Due to distribution of seats between safe-red, safe-blue and swing states, 60 seats in the senate is a fantasy for the Democrats in this environment. Republicans also routinely refuse to cross the isle even if programs proposed, like IRA, benefit their states. And despite a narrow majority all throughout Biden's term, Sinema and Manchin made sure that the filibuster remains in place. I'm more lenient towards Manchin, Blue dog Democrat and all, but Sinema has proven to be nothing but a grifter.

I wonder if that played a part in alienating the progressive vote. Both Sinema and Fetterman saw a lot of love from progressives during the election, but after assuming office they took a hard-right turn that made people who canvassed and donated to them feel cheated.

I'll say it: Biden is the best president America has had in a while.

Meanwhile, look around. We live in a country where a convicted felon, accused of things that would make your grandma drop her tea, leads the charge. Stirred up an insurrection? Check. Accused of sexual assault? Double-check. And yet, somehow, people think this is all hilarious. It‚Äôs all just ‚Äúowning the libs,‚Äù right? Well, guess what: I‚Äôm exhausted. Both parties, corporate interests, and yes, a whole lot of sheeple, worked hard to serve us this circus of exhaustion. And it‚Äôs not as funny as they think.

Here‚Äôs the deal: I‚Äôm not a Democrat, and I‚Äôm not a Republican. Never wanted to be. I don‚Äôt plant my flag in any camp; I change my mind when the facts demand it ‚Äî and that seems like a lost art. I‚Äôm not a Liberal, and I‚Äôm not a Conservative.

Somehow, we‚Äôve collectively said it‚Äôs okay to hurt, shame, or ostracize anyone who‚Äôs different from us. We‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs fine to let an expectant mother die because someone believes life starts at conception, and in the same breath, we‚Äôve said it‚Äôs okay to let others suffer because they‚Äôre out of ink on their imaginary checkbooks. All because, what, they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúpull themselves up by the bootstraps‚Äù? It‚Äôs a nation of contradictions, and I‚Äôm over it.

Let‚Äôs talk about the faith crowd ‚Äî specifically, the ones who are told not to idolize anyone.

Because he promised to lower prices and throw us a few crumbs from his ‚Äútrickle-down‚Äù table? Sorry, but I want a future built on prosperity for all of us, not on a scrap economy where we fight over pocket change.

This is where we‚Äôve landed, folks. We had our shot at creating a future worth believing in ‚Äî a chance to stand up for our rights, our freedom, and our constitutional republic. Instead, we signed up to follow a would-be tyrant and put our hopes in the ‚Äúcheaper prices‚Äù lie, while the real work ‚Äî immigration, real wealth-building, opportunity for everyone ‚Äî got kicked to the curb.

The Oaf Keepers, Proud Boys, and many people Trump relied on for fraud claims and facilitators of the J6 insurrection like Sydney Powell all had to be convicted to later be used against him in a court of law. Biden and Garland both were most likely confident that Trump would face immense backlash from most Republicans and could not win another primary. They miscalculated the number of Republicans that had left the party, while not knowing how many NEW Republicans and independents were jumping on the Trump bandwagon.

I believe it was resources, COVID, number of personnel, number of crimes, the sheer amounts of evidence needed to be acquired, and miscalculation of Trump's appeal after J6 that contributed to the delay. Then Trump knows the legal process and threw lawyers and lawsuits and abused the quid pro quo relationships he had with his judicial appointees in order to delay or dismiss cases.

Those are the enlisted grunts. They did not, actually, all vote for Trump. First of all, turnout rates in the military are far lower (¬Ω to ‚Öî) than the civilian average. Those that do vote appear to do so roughly inline with their civilian counterparts.

Regardless, enlisted don't issue orders. They're tasked with executing orders. Officers issue orders. Officers run the military. Officers are college educated. It is extremely hard to poll the officer corps, but they appear to more or less mirror the leanings of educated civilians.

If they do nothing after a coup, it's not because the rank and file have a partisan lean. It's because they're following their tradition of following orders and not involving the military in domestic politics. 

If the generals instead choose to overthow a coup, it isn't necessarily because they don't like Trump's policies. It's because they're sworn to uphold the Constitution.

"That woman in the video was so incoherent that I am sure she did not understand what she was trying to say.

There are 3 basic ways that computers can be hacked to alter the outcome of an election. There are several variations on the 3 main themes.

1. The machines at the precinct level have been hacked to alter the tallies. It is believed that this method was used by machines from a manufacturer who employed a person with multiple fraud convictions, as their lead programmer, from the mid 1980s to the early 2000s. When decompiled, the software was found to have a backdoor and set of switches in it, so that a certain proportion of votes for candidate A would be transferred to candidate B. Typically, 1 out of every 30 votes for A would be instead recorded as a vote for B. That would reduce the votes for A by 3.33% and increase the votes for B by 3.33%. (I have read there is some evidence this was done in the Bush/Dukakis election of 1988, and in the Bush/Clinton/Perot election of 1992, but that in the latter case, the winner won by such a large margin that the software could not overcome the result, since it only stole a fixed percentage of the votes.)
2. The next method is the man-in-the-middle attack. The precinct level machines would be hacked to send their vote tallies to a 3rd party. The third party would then examine the results and alter them either with a program, or manually, to get the desired outcome. This method was allegedly used to alter the outcome in Ohio, in 2004, resulting in the reelection of Bush. There is also a persistent story on the Web that Aaron Swartz, one of the founders of Reddit, detected Karl Rove of the Romney campaign attempting to use the same software in 2012, but he was locked out of the software by Swartz, who changed the passwords, hours before the election. Aaron Swartz was later found dead, an apparent suicide. 
3. Hack the tallying computers at a central location. This method was used by Paul Manafort, who was caught doing this during the election in the Philippines of Marcos vs Aquino. Exit polls of the voters showed 70%-75% vote for Aquino, but the tallies broadcast from the national election center were clearly being manually altered, since the official numbers for Aquino would drop and the numbers for Marcos would rise, until the totals were 90% for Marcos and 10% for Aquino. Aquino was later murdered, and Marcos and Manafort were forced out of the country due to the obvious fraud. Manafort then tried the same thing in Ukraine.

Method 1 is difficult to detect, unless you have access to the software in the precinct level machines. Note that members of MAGA with ties to the FSB did gain access to machines with the vote tallying software after the 2020 election, and before the 2024 election.

In 2016 there were claims by Green Party members that when they hand counted during the recounts in Wisconsin, they found that the vote tallying machines had miscounted the first 200 votes they audited, and that out of 200 votes, 3 had been switched from Clinton to Trump. The observer was ejected for disturbing the peace, and the recount went forward, using only machine recounts. No hand recounts to check the accuracy of the machines were allowed.

Method 2 can be be defeated in 2 ways. (A) by requiring verbal transmission of vote tallies over the phone, or by requiring paper tallies to be transferred by couriers, who provide physical security for the sealed results. (B) If data is transmitted via the internet, including Starlink, the data should be encrypted and broken up into packets that are each sent by a different route, so that only the first and last links in the chain of custody have access to the entire message, and thus a chance to decode the message. I think that was what the lady in the video was yammering about, but as encryption is ~operating system independent, I don't know what Linux would have to do with it.

If the third method was in use, well, if you cannot trust your election workers at the highest levels, there is no defense. 

Incidentally, this was the method Trump tried to use in Georgia in 2016, when he asked the Secretary of State to ""Find me 11,780 Votes. Just recalculate the numbers,"" meaning add the totals incorrectly. 

---

A variation on method 1 would be to intercept the ballots at the Post Office, and not deliver mail-in ballots from addresses where known Democrats lived. Since party registrations are not secret, that would be possible, though hard to conceal from later detection.

Swartz had nothing to do with it, and died by suicide after federal prosecutors (*under Obama* before anyone starts another misinformation claim) victimised him and tried to make him an example for a completely different and unrelated act of hacktivism to do with releasing a huge store of copyrighted academic papers. 

There's no known link between Swartz and anonymous, and no evidence he was ever a member or even had any contact with them at all.

The anonymous claim comes from a [completely unsupported letter](https://www.salon.com/2012/11/20/did_anonymous_stop_rove_stealing_the_election/) to Velvet Revolution (an election transparency non-profit), [written in ridiculous fake olde-worlde speech](https://samuel-warde.com/2012/11/did-anonymous-block-carl-roves-attempt-to-steal-election/), which contains multiple unsupported claims and straight-out factual errors, including the fundamental fact that the system they claimed was changing votes was actually a Get Out The Vote database owned by **Romney's** campaign, not Rove.

There's no evidence the ORCA system had anything to do with changing voting totals, and the letter was released in response to Velvet Revolution offering hundreds of thousands of dollars' reward for anyone that could prove vote-tampering or election fraud by right-wing campaigns... but which was apparently never actually claimed.

"Said this in another thread about this topic that got deleted but here‚Äôs my thoughts:

I think a lot of people are missing the message that Bernie and more progressive members have signaled and it‚Äôs that Dems haven‚Äôt truly passed bold country changing legislation since LBJ and the new deal era of Democratic policy. During that time, Dems restructured the banking system, strengthened government over site and penalties for corporations, raised minimum wage with the cost of living, created social security, created Medicare and Medicaid, housing act of 1949, creation of FHA, and increased stabilization of prices through federal over site post WW2. Whenever older republicans talk about the good old days they‚Äôre talking about days of very progressive Democratic legislation.¬†¬†

¬†With all of that said the 1980s was the end of New Deal Dems and more adoption of certain Neo Liberal stances such as NAFTA, smaller federal spending, and tax incentives to direct corporations. The last legislation that could have truly revolutionized the U.S. and probably rivaled that of SS, Medicare, etc. was the ACA and this is where I think the working class once again lost trust in Dems.¬†

We failed to hold those accountable for the 2008 financial crisis and then the Public Option was stripped from the final version of the ACA which imo was the single largest portion of that bill. Then the courts stripped the mandatory expanded medicaid requirement. Then you look at policy positions voters have been clamoring for for more than two decades (Expansion of Medicare, Paid family leave, increasing federal minimum wage, and banning Super PACs/corporate money from politics) and we just don‚Äôt move on it. ¬† Imo these are policy positions they need to run on because traditionally, Dems have dominated politics when they have bold ideas. Right now Dems to the electorate just seems like the status quo. Obviously there‚Äôs nuance like the right wing media machine and other things, but the point still stands.
I‚Äôm not sure I even self Identify as a progressive Democrat and I still think Biden passed some absolutely consequential legislation and did help the working class in many ways, but it‚Äôs obvious voters feel Dems missed the mark where it mattered most: ‚Äúwhat are you gonna do to make my life easier?‚Äù",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Nancy lives in a big urban blue state.  She needs to shut her mouth  and let the people who represent rural areas of the country drive now. 

This is what I'm most worried about.  I'm afraid Democratic leadership isn't going to read the tea leaves correctly on this loss.

At this point, we've lost the fight to prevent Trump from returning to the white house, and there's very little we can do for harm reduction even if we manage to secure House/Senate as long as we have the ""reach across the aisle and give them civility"" democrats.

So its far more important we instead focus over the next four years, on pushing out enabling influences for Trump, starting from within the Democratic party itself; and it also just generally means focusing on local and state level elections to build up new talent over the next four years to replace the current establishment.",2024_11_11,17_08_15
"In my opinion, the reason why the working class has abandoned the Democratic Party is because it‚Äôs filled with neoliberal millionaires who do insider trading and have campaigns that are funded by gigantic lobbying groups. Bernie Sanders and the progressive wing of the party are the only people who are willing to point out this fact and signal a necessity to move in a more progressive direction away from the elitist stain that is currently on the Democrats. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve seen a lot of liberals saying that the Democratic party actually needs to become more conservative after this loss and I find that incredibly disheartening. I wish this party would finally understand that the American people support bold progressive policy and want to be served by a steadfast candidate who actually seems like they represent them instead of the billionaire class.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

The Dems need to have an all out, knock-down, drag-out primary - a free market of ideas - to find a leader the base can rally around and determine the new direction of the party. If the elites decide the direction of the party from their ivory tower yet again, then the party won‚Äôt win again for a long time.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"Even if they did bring forward legislation to raise the minimum wage, we know it wouldn‚Äôt pass, we don‚Äôt have the votes for it with the filibuster. 

I do understand why progressives are upset, I really do, but this rhetoric is driving me a little bit crazy tbh. Did the Democratic Party run a perfect campaign? No. Did they make some mistakes? Probably. Trump ran a worse campaign though. I don‚Äôt know how you can justify staying home if you are a progressive. I know people want to punish the Democrats for not listening to them, but you‚Äôre also punishing the entire rest of the country. Bare minimum, the fact that Trump is an active step BACKWARDS should be enough to vote again him. The Republicans win with shitty candidates, because they get out to vote as long as the candidate has SOMETHING they want. Dems lose with qualified candidates because many of us don‚Äôt vote unless we get excited about a candidate.

I was really excited about Harris. I even phone-banked for her. My family are all moderate Democrats who align much more with Harris than with Bernie. If Bernie was the candidate though, my family would have gone out to vote for him, because Trump is nuts, and I still agree with Bernie on some things. 

As much as it sucks, we have two options in this country. We are much more likely to get progressive policies under a Democratic administration, than a Republican one. We need to STOP tearing down our own party and playing the blame game every time we lose. We need to have introspection, yes, but this party is the only vehicle we have to get into office, so bashing it publicly is not helpful. 

Criticizing people is one thing, but we honestly treat every a lot of Dem politicians like garbage. Biden was far from perfect, but he still beat Trump, strengthen the U.S. economy, strengthened NATO, and passed major legislative wins. In return he‚Äôs gotten constant criticism from both side, and while some of the criticism is fair, it has been allowed to completely overshadow anything else he‚Äôs done. Same thing with Harris, she has been criticized for four years despite being the vice president which is a mostly powerless job. She stepped into the race three months before the election, was subject to a litany of racism and misogyny from the other side, and when the race is over, she‚Äôll probably have only lost by a few million votes. Considering the multiple issues going against her like Gaza, the border, and inflation that‚Äôs pretty damn good. What have we heard the last few days since she lost? She‚Äôs unlikable. She ran a bad campaign. She didn‚Äôt communicate her message well. HOLY SHIT! Why would anyone EVER want to be a Democratic nominee. Again, I‚Äôm not saying we can‚Äôt criticize our elected officials, but Harris was essentially thrown to the wolves in this election and she‚Äôs now getting it from both sides. She wasn‚Äôt running against Jesus here. She was running against TRUMP! She was a NORMAL politician! She wasn‚Äôt likable enough? Trump is a would-be fascist, having an empty Oval Office for the next 4 years is arguably better than him getting back in.

I‚Äôm sorry for the rant, but I‚Äôm so frustrated. Millions of people volunteered and worked their asses off to prevent another Trump presidency. Even some Republicans did it. This is 2016 all over again. People criticize Dems for sticking to the center, but pivoting to the left requires the Democratic Party to take a leap of faith that progressives will come out in enough numbers to offset any losses made with moderates. Given the stakes, it makes sense why they were hesitant to do that. We have a Catch-22 where Dems don‚Äôt trust progressives to turn out, and progressives won‚Äôt turn out until Dems make the first move. It is not exclusively one sides fault, I know that. The Democrats hold some blame for their inability to motivate people to get out. On the personal level though, if YOU didn‚Äôt vote, while knowing the potential consequences for what that would mean, that is a decision YOU made, not the Democrats. You were the one that ultimately made the decision that you were willing to risk another Trump presidency, because you were unhappy with the Democrats, and the entire country and wider world will have to live with that decision.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

And the thing is, that I agree with that statement! Harris, and Biden before her, *campaigned* as centrist candidates, but once they took office they did more to advance progressive policy than any presidency since the New Deal. They learned the lesson from the Obama years that congressional republicans were not seriously negotiating with them and they used their narrow majority in the senate and the presidency as a cudgel to advance their goals. 

I have little doubt that a Harris administration would have behaved similarly. Unfortunately, that doesn‚Äôt matter because far too many people stayed home and refused to support the candidate that most directly aligned with their interests.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"It's pretty easy to piss off your own party when there's clear momentum amongst your constituents to nominate a particular candidate in the primary (Bernie) only to conspire within the party to nominate someone else (Hillary).

For both the elections Trump won, the DNC expected us to just pick whomever they chose for us from on high, thinking we'd vote for anyone so long as they aren't Trump. Turns out a lot of people just abstain when you lie and trample over them like that.

People who supported Trump in 2016 had the experience of carrying him through the primary and forcing his nomination to a RELUCTANT Republican party. This made him truly a candidate of his people because they overthrew the control of the RNC. As far as MAGA Republicans are concerned, Trump represents them and isn't beholden to the party's wishes.

People are overcomplicating their assessment of what particular mistakes the DNC made or how they ran the campaign; it's far simpler than that. They just need to trust their constituents and let them choose a candidate for themselves with no behind-the-curtain trickery.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

All they do is point fingers at the left while continuing their failed strategy to court swing state conservatives.

Life for the average person has gotten worse every year in this country since I've been alive. People can't afford their groceries anymore. Home ownership is out of reach for the vast majority of my generation. No one is having kids because they either can't afford them, or they don't want to bring more people into the world because life sucks and we have no future as a species thanks to climate change inaction.

Actually, I lied. What makes us the most angry is that Dem-aligned media sources have successfully erased the progressive populism movement and replaced it with insufferable identity politics. It was always about evidence-based policy like public health insurance that almost every other first world country already has. Still hundreds of thousands of people in jail for nonviolent drug crimes and hundreds of thousands more declare bankruptcy over their medical bills every year, all easily preventable.

We just want to fix some of the problems in this country that have obvious answers. But the Dems won't do any of it and they hate us for asking for it.

Don't mistake this for some kind of ""both sides"" garbage. We know Dems are better. We vote Dem down ballot. But not because we want to. Because we have to. We are demoralized, because Dems don't represent us, and even more so because we know they don't want to.

Sanders is speaking the truth ya'll don't want to hear. He is 100% correct. Resist the urge to rationalize valid criticism away. We lost for a reason; this kind of landslide is not an accident. Trump is successful because he is popular, and he is popular because he embraced the things his base wants. As insane as they are. Democrats could just as easily embrace populism, and they'll have to, or they'll continue to fail. The status quo isn't working for the 99% and if that's all you will do, the voters are gonna vote for the possibility of change every time. Even if the change is horrifying.

As the conservatives have officially abandoned socialism and are actively dismissing any progressice efforts to pursue equalities as ""woke,"" they cry and cry and cry about the ever-widening economic inequalities. But on the other side, Democrat politicians do not respond by adopting socialist policies, but rather distance themselves further and further away from people like Bernie.

"Also, the media is going to try to portray the democrats as going after one another post-election and that just isn‚Äôt the case. Nancy heaped praise on Bernie in her NYTimes interview. I‚Äôve posted excerpts at the bottom of this comment. 

Nancy disagrees that the Democrats abandoned the working class because nearly all the legislation that Biden passed was geared towards the working class. Bernie is saying the Democrats abandoned the working class because that‚Äôs how voters feel- he‚Äôs emulating Trump in the GOP. Trump excoriated the GOP the whole time he ran for the nomination in 2016 and people loved it. 

Bernie is trying to push the party to echo voter sentiments to win them over. It doesn‚Äôt matter if Biden was the most pro-union, progressive president in a generation because people vote emotionally based on rhetoric, not policy. 

Nancy, as an old-guard leader of the party, thinks it‚Äôs a mistake to say ‚Äúwe abandoned you‚Äù because it‚Äôs simply not true. But finding the right rhetoric for the working class who think the Dems are over-educated elitists who abandoned  them is tricky.

Also, a more full quote from Nancy Pelosi:

‚ÄúLet me, with all due respect, and I have a great deal of respect for [Bernie], for what he stands for, but I don‚Äôt respect him saying that the Democratic Party has abandoned the working-class families. That‚Äôs where we are. For example, under President Biden, you see the rescue package, money in the pockets of people, shots in the arm, children in school safely, working people back to work. What did, what‚Äôs his name? What did Trump do when he was president? One bill that gave a tax cut to the richest people in America.‚Äù

On whether the electorate is beholden to cultural issues or economic issues:

‚ÄúNothing is ‚Äúit.‚Äù It‚Äôs part of it. Because it‚Äôs really hard to understand how someone would vote for somebody like Trump who‚Äôs been there for the wealthiest people. And again, I think the message that Bernie Sanders has put out is not the winning message for the American people. I love him. I think he‚Äôs great. He‚Äôs been a wonderful, shall we say, champion for his point of view, but his point of view is not correct when he says the Democrats have abandoned working families. Same thing with Manchin.

"The GOP is even worse for the working class, but both parties are deeply into capitalism and have been promoting policies that are not good for the working class, only for the rich.

But I would say that the biggest difference is rhetoric. I don't know what exactly, but the GOP message feels more directed into working people when they are talking about the economy. They spend much time being racist or homophones, but on other issues I feel like the message will be better received by working class people like factory workers. 

Of course the conditions will be even worse, but the Democratic Party has to change. For example, on the other day I heard Joy-Ann Reid on MSNBC saying that Kamala run a flawless campaign because she had endorsements from every celebrity, like Beyonc√© and Taylor Swift.

>*Some Democrats in Congress are signaling they‚Äôre prepared to throw norms to the wayside in order to hike the minimum wage to $15 after Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled a measure to do so cannot be included in the coronavirus relief bill, calling for firing her or overruling her decision.*

>*A parliamentarian can be **overruled by the presiding officer of the Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris**, but White House chief of staff Ron Klain shut down that idea during an MSNBC interview on Wednesday: ‚ÄúCertainly that's not something we would do.‚Äù*

>*That sentiment was echoed in a statement from White House press secretary Jen Psaki on the ruling, which said Biden was ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù in the outcome but **‚Äúrespects the parliamentarian‚Äôs decision and the Senate‚Äôs process‚Äù** and wants Congress to ‚Äúmove quickly‚Äù on passing the relief package.*

>*Khanna¬†noted¬†to the¬†Washington Post¬†that Vice President Hubert Humphrey ‚Äúroutinely‚Äù overruled the parliamentarian, adding ‚Äú**This simply comes down to whether the VP will choose to include the $15 or not.**‚Äù*

The parliamentarian is an advisory role only and can be overruled at any time, but Biden is stuck on these archaic institutional traditions, not realizing the people fucking hate the institution because it doesn't work for them.

It's populism. From Wikipedia:

>Populism is a range of political stances that emphasize the idea of the common people and often position this group in opposition to a perceived elite group. It is frequently associated with anti-establishment and anti-political sentiment.

Sound familiar?

Populism is old as dirt. The Gracchi brothers were Roman populists in the 2nd century BC. Trump isn't new. He's very, very, very old.

The conventional approach to defeating populism is government reform. Populist movements are animated by people's perception of corruption, abuse of power, and apathy towards the plight of common people by the government. That sentiment is what populists latch onto and turn like a spear on the political ruling-class to upend the status quo that people feel has failed them. The populist, of course, has their own ends in mind, sometimes noble, often not.

The political establishment could likely defeat Trumpism by just doing a couple things:

- Eliminate dark, corporate, and organizational money in politics.
- Pass legislation against partisan gerrymandering.
- Make for-profit lobbying illegal.
- Crack down on insider trading by Congress.
- Establish an upper age limit for public office. 

There's plenty more to do beyond that, but just knocking out those few would greatly increase the electorate's confidence in the US government. The populist masses aren't pissed that problems exist. They're pissed that their government is ineffectual in addressing those problems because it's mired in corruption and fuckery --- Trump's proverbial ""swamp.""

And let's be frank here, there are very few middle class people left. It's been shrinking for decades.

The system is broken and you can either make large scale reforms or you're going to get beaten by people who promise to destroy the system from the inside because people are frustrated.

This election wasn't white people. This election wasn't the elderly. This election was decided by manipulation and propaganda. All those YouTube shorts, Podcasters, etc. spreading misinformation is what cost Harris this race. Ofc, Trump only wants to attack 'fake news' mainstream media.

Go watch right leaning independent media vs left. Right will NEVER admit their side does anything wrong. On the left? They try to hard to appear credible. They admit fault. They try to be realists.

"Joe Rogan wasn‚Äôt a conservative muppet until just before COVID began. I would know, because I would watch him regularly. I have seen nearly every single episode he‚Äôs put out since 2012, until I stopped watching altogether in March 2020.¬†

Joe Rogan first and foremost considers himself a stand-up comic. By and large the podcast is about being a comic. I have watched entire other podcasts from other comedians who are friends of his that appeared on his show, like Tom Segura, Duncan Trussell, Joey Diaz, Bert Krishner. The Joe Rogan Experience and its attached internet forum were places to discuss fringe topics such as obscure comedy specials, weed legalization, psychedelic drug trips, crazy internet sites and videos, mixed martial arts, UFO‚Äôs, conspiracy theories, and de-classified government material. By the very nature of its content, it was alt-left, fringe-left, or dirty-left, anti-corporate, anti-government, anti-military industrial complex and by proxy, anti-conservative. Imagine if HBO produced episodes of the X-Files. THAT was what the JRE was. Joe would interview anybody he was interested in learning from, whether it was fellow comedians, athletes, musicians, scientists, or other figures associated with offering alternative opinions on mainstream ideas. People like Graham Hancock, for example, a guy who believes in Ancient Aliens.¬†

As¬†the show became more popular, viewers requested more mainstream figures to be guests on the pod. Joe obliged them. Now you had big name comedians, big name athletes, big name musicians, business owners, influencers etc. The show became more mainstream. Joe would invite whichever personality was relevant at the time, and this was starting to include skeptics and controversial figures like Sam Harris, Steve Molyneux, Jordan Peterson, Gavin McGuinness, people who we didn‚Äôt immediately distrust, but who were pushing against what we would now label the far-left or the woke-left. The audience was now dividing itself into left and right.¬†

Years went on and Joe gets pushed further and further into the right wing as the left pushes him away and distances itself from him. Now he‚Äôs all about health and masculinity and hunting and gun rights. On and on and on until one day Bill Burr, a person who knew Joe since they started comedy in Boston decades ago, has to tell Joe to shut up about vaccines because maybe it isn‚Äôt a good idea to be fighting expert opinions in the beginning of a brutal pandemic, and Duncan Trussell, one if the OG guests and friends of Joe is warning a drunken Joe that he shouldn‚Äôt allow his podcast to become a platform for right-wing propagandists.

And now in 2024 Joe Rogan is endorsing Donald Trump.¬†

So yeah, if you‚Äôre a Gen Z‚Äôr do a little research before you fall victim to this kind of betrayal.¬†",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"I'm not surprised but I don't consider them conservatives. I consider them young men aligning with MAGA branding/cult because they were the first generation that grew up in the midst of the #metoo and spotlight on equality and I think many men felt (wrongly) disenfranchised during that. I remember reading constant overblown stories of men being like ""guess I need to ask permission to hold a girl's hand now or else I'll get a court case brought against me 15 years from now."" 

These young men grew up seeing celebrities and other (terrible) men having their lives ruined (deservedly) because of actions they took decades prior. It shocked young men into thinking that at any moment their life could be upended because of the (true) stories of these women. They didn't see the women as the victims, they saw the men as the victims. 

So I think what we're seeing is not young men going conservative in the traditional sense. It's young men aligning with Trump specifically. The want to align themselves with the pussy grabber, the rich white guy who says racist shit and commits crimes and gets away with it. It's like a hyper realignment trying to bring back the male elitist days, because those young Gen-Z men wish they were rich and invincible like Trump, and Trump gives them an excuse and justification to be the worst version of themselves. It's like Trump is a walking mob boss and they think it's cool and want to be in that circle. 

That's why we see Gen-Z wearing so much MAGA stuff because it's not a political affiliation, it's a brand that signifies their desire to be ""alpha"" and to forcefully reinstate the white male back at the top of the totem pole.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"Here‚Äôs the AI summary:

Project 2025 proposes several significant changes to overtime pay regulations that would generally reduce workers‚Äô access to overtime compensation. Here are the key points:

Redefining Overtime Calculation Period

Project 2025 recommends allowing employers to calculate overtime over longer periods, specifically proposing:

A two-week or four-week period for overtime calculations instead of the current weekly basis. This means employers could require employees to work over 40 hours in one week without paying overtime, as long as the total hours over the longer period don‚Äôt exceed the threshold (e.g. 80 hours over two weeks)

Lowering the Overtime Eligibility Threshold

The plan proposes returning to the Trump-era overtime salary threshold, which was lower than the current threshold set by the Biden administration. This would reduce the number of workers eligible for overtime pay, potentially affecting millions of employees

Alternative Compensation for Overtime

Project 2025 suggests allowing employers to offer alternatives to monetary overtime pay:

Giving employees the option to accumulate paid time off instead of receiving overtime wages.

Basing overtime calculations exclusively on base hourly or salary rates, potentially excluding bonuses or commissions from overtime calculations

Regional Variations

The plan recommends maintaining an overtime threshold that ‚Äúdoes not punish businesses in lower-cost regions‚Äù

This could lead to different overtime rules in different parts of the country
Impact on Workers

These proposed changes would likely result in:
	‚Ä¢	Fewer workers being eligible for overtime pay
	‚Ä¢	More flexibility for employers in managing work hours without incurring overtime costs
	‚Ä¢	Potential reduction in take-home pay for many workers who currently receive overtime
	‚Ä¢	More complex and potentially confusing overtime rules for employees to navigate
Overall, Project 2025‚Äôs overtime proposals align with a pro-business approach that prioritizes employer flexibility over worker protections and compensation.",2024_11_11,17_08_15
"I uploaded the entirety of Project 2025 to a NotebookLM notebook and have been asking it questions about what's in there. Here's what it said when I asked, ""What does the document have to say about overtime?"":

Here's what the sources say about overtime:

* **The sources raise concerns about the Fair Labor Standards Act's (FLSA) overtime pay requirements for ""nonexempt workers.""** Nonexempt workers are those whose job duties fall under the law's purview or whose total pay is below a certain threshold. The FLSA mandates that these workers receive time-and-a-half pay for any hours worked exceeding 40 in a given workweek.

* **The sources propose that Congress clarify that the ""regular rate"" used to calculate overtime pay should be based solely on an employee's salary, excluding the value of any benefits provided.** This change would give employers more freedom to offer additional benefits without worrying about significant increases in overtime pay.

* **The sources recommend allowing employers and employees to determine the overtime calculation period over a more extended timeframe, such as two or four weeks.** This would provide employees with more flexibility to work additional hours in one week and fewer in the following week without requiring employers to pay extra for the same total hours worked within the chosen period.

* **The sources suggest that Congress clarify that overtime rules for telework only apply when an employee exceeds 10 hours of work in a single day and works more than 40 hours in a week.** Additionally, the Department of Labor (DOL) should clarify that a home office is not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations and that time spent setting up a home office is not considered compensable or eligible for overtime calculations. DOL should also clarify that reimbursing employees for home office expenses, even recurring costs like internet or cell phone service, does not factor into an employee‚Äôs regular rate calculation.

* **The sources highlight that lower- and middle-income workers are more likely to be employed in jobs subject to overtime laws.** To address this, they recommend that Congress pass the Working Families Flexibility Act. This Act would empower private-sector employees to choose between receiving time-and-a-half pay or accruing time-and-a-half paid time off, giving them more control over their schedules.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"I'm an Independent, and I'm done putting my hopes on democrats in future elections. This party just keeps making the same mistakes over and over again by ignoring the conversations we really need to be having. That's the fact that Kamala ran a great campaign. Our electorate is 100% the problem.

Seriously. No one had any issues with Kamala's campaign until she lost. Literally everyone said she ran a flawless campaign, and the only time anyone started doubting it was election night. Even then, we were all confused as to how things ended up so badly. Many of us still are.

You all loved the fact she was able to bring people together across party lines to fight for what is right. Maybe you didn't like Dick Cheney, but it was an incredible feat, nonetheless.

You loved her policies. You loved her plans. You loved her work ethic.

We all agreed she was the obvious choice, considering the other guy is a rapist, an insurrectionist, and a convicted felon.

We all agreed she was the obvious choice, considering his economic plans are rated the absolute worst between the two candidates. Trump will likely lead us into another recession/depression and his increase to the deficit will be worse than last time.

We all thought she was the obvious choice, considering Trump's next cabinet pick is as likely to be Kid Rock as it is to be Rudy Giuliani.

We all thought she was the obvious choice, considering Trump is planning to turn the US military against political rivals, pundits, immigrants, and more than likely, eventually, the rest of us.

We all thought she was the obvious choice because she was a prosecutor and Trump was a felon who wanted to pardon J6 traitors.

I could go on and on, but I've made my point.

Right now, the post-mortem is more about how the democrats should have worked harder to tell MAGA what they wanted to hear. Tell me, though, how would that have been any different than the campaign Kamala already ran?

By going on Joe Rogan? What, exactly, is Kamala's message for incels and other general misogynists who say things like, ""your body, my choice""? How does Kamala swing the KKK and Proud Boys to vote for her? How does she convince Puerto Ricans, who are OK with being called trash to their faces, to vote for her?

What is her message for the working class people who mocked her when she spoke about coming from a middle-class family and working at McDonald's?

What is her message for the people who constantly rose the bar higher and higher for her while lowering it further and further for Trump?

What is the message for the people who heard Trump say things like, ""theeey're eating the doowwwgs"" during a debate she clearly won but they voted for him anyways?

The reality is that we have a very large portion of the population who is hell-bent on ignorance, chaos, and revenge. Our only hope now is that they feel it and make a change next time (if possible). Although I seriously doubt they will. It will always be the democrats' fault; largely because the democrats keep telling them they're right. This party will keep losing until you people start getting real and grow a pair. Good luck.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"It's a general politician issue I think rather than a Democrat specific one. In the traditional media landscape you go on the news, then you have 5-10 minutes, maybe even less, and a lot of politicians have been trained with a memorized 30 second speech that they hammer over and over again, and in that short time frame it works. Like the famous Marco Rubio gaf with Chris Christie. 

But I think a lot of politicians aren't suited for the changing news landscape with podcasters, because when the interview is an hour long or even 3 hours, when you do those rehearsed talking points over and over again, you come off as insincere and not authentic. In contrast someone like Trump, that likes to babble on about random things, wherever his train of thought takes him, kinda thrives on that environment. 

Especially when we're talking about these podcasts like Rogan that are not primarily political. I don't think someone listening to the NYT podcasts for example is an independent.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"Trump's podcast with Rogan reached 23 million views on youtube within 24 hours.  In an election that is decided by small margins, that's a number you cannot afford to concede to your opponents.  

Rogan spent years not wanting Trump on his podcast.  I think that if Harris went on JRE, he would not have endorsed Trump.  I think Rogan's Trump endorsement (when you consider he is naturally a Bernie bro) only happened because Joe perceived Kamala as a coward, and I agree with that sentiment.  

There was also David Ramsey: when he asked to interview both Trump and Harris, Trump asked Ramsey ""when and where?"", Harris declined the interview.  

Joe Rogan and Dave Ramsey are NOT small potatoes, Rogan is the #1 podcaster in the world, Ramsey is a giant in the personal finance space.  Conceding this ground to Trump, and not doing an appearance, with two guys who are NOT political and are not going to ask difficult questions, is lunacy.  They are not going to ask highly-detailed policy questions, they are just going to verify that you are a functioning human being.  

In the 2028 cycle, if a Democratic candidate for president is incapable of doing 3 hours on JRE, they will not win the nomination.  In 2028, people are going to want to see the JRE appearance BEFORE the primary process starts.  

Trump was able to do these podcasts, and Harris completely conceded that entire space by running away from it.  

It's not even that young men, and male voters in general, are the dominant audience of these podcasts, it's that her refusal to even appear branded her as a coward who was afraid to do it.  Right or wrong, you don't get to define yourself when you don't even show up.  

Jim Gaffigan yelled at her about it from the podium at the Al Smith dinner: Northern Pennsylvania is heavily Catholic.  The Al Smith Dinner is the biggest Catholic charity shin-dig around.  Harris skipped it, Trump was at least there.  Are you trying to convince Catholics you hate them?  Because that's how you convince Catholics you hate them.  

What's frustrating is that these are all low hanging fruit.  The Al Smith dinner isn't hard, Rogan isn't hard, Dave Ramsey isn't hard.  This isn't an interview at the world economic summit, you show up, tell a few jokes, tell a few stories, answer a few easy questions and that's it.

They could see the numbers that the Trump interview garnered at that point (at least a good chunk of them). There is literally nothing more important than talking to 10%+ of the entire U.S population for 3 hours at the end of a campaign. It was a huge goldmine of coverage that she voluntarily turned down and worse Joe obviously told all his viewers in subsequent podcasts that he tried to get Kamala on his show and that she declined to appear.

Trump was saying, ‚ÄúOh, she couldn‚Äôt do an interview with you. She‚Äôd have a panic attack, she‚Äôd have to leave in an ambulance,‚Äù and things like that.

Rogan was explaining, no, like he legitimately just wanted to talk to her for a few hours and get to know her. 

As much as I don‚Äôt like the guy, I think he was being sincere about that because that‚Äôs just what he usually does. He just talks to them. He will push back when he disagrees. But, he mostly just talks to people. 

It‚Äôs part of what makes his show kind of a problem when it comes to misinformation. Because he‚Äôll bring in conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers and picks their brain because he thinks it‚Äôs interesting. But even if he pushes back, he‚Äôs still giving the guest a platform.

I think Kamala not doing his show was a mistake",2024_11_11,17_08_15

I personally feel like people like Rogan because he asks questions like a child. And I do not mean that in a condescending way. It‚Äôs actually a great thing.

In 1924 Coolidge won his election partly because of that newfangled thing called a radio. He spent way more money on it, shortened his speeches to better fit the medium, even invested in his own radio station and simul broadcasted his speeches to get better exposure than a regular tour.

Similarly in 1952, Einsenhower was coached by Rosse Reeves to make the best use of TV.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"It‚Äôs a change in media consumption. 20-30 years ago you watched legacy media largely if you didn‚Äôt attend political events. In some aspects it‚Äôs good as they can be long format and we can see a more thought out approach from a candidate or a humanizing view. The questions are whether or not these podcasts and podcasters are equipped to potentially pose thoughtful or important questions and have political knowledge to test these candidates. That being said we are in an era where most folks want to hear a politician who is human and talks in a non uniform speech, someone who doesn‚Äôt need a teleprompter or an outline of what will be discussed. That does great for humanizing a candidate but often means we will never get great conversation about policy and actual important scenarios these candidates run on. Trump did well because he can talk forever about anything and hyped and butters every podcaster up who gives him a platform. Less and less ppl trust traditional forms of media for providing factual or accurate non biased information and as the millennial and gen z generation get older that method of consumption will continue to change. I‚Äôd wager millennials only know and sometimes pay attention to legacy media because they grew up with it and watched internet become the new beacon of information as children to adults. Gen Z is not buying cable or tuning in, Gen Alpha will probably at his rate consume media purely in brain rot meme Roblox chat rooms",2024_11_11,17_08_15

If you are the Dem establishment and you see a podcast, you are less likely to want to engage with it because you run the risk of your host antagonizing you. If you were the MSM and you were hostile to any of them, you can kiss getting anymore interviews with politicians they depend on for views good bye. Podcasts don‚Äôt have to rely on them to function, though. It‚Äôs not like Joe Rogan had a politician on every single week.

Furthermore, the establishment Dems are so manicured and hyper focused on presentation that you could never throw Kamala on any podcast that isn‚Äôt something like Call Me Daddy. Kamala is an awkward woman who seems like she has no interests and hobbies in anything outside of work. She is the kind of person who would be so concerned about ‚Äúoh my god, how many voters am I losing to republicans if I say that I tried out some weed when I was young and in college?‚Äù that she doesn‚Äôt realize that podcast audiences don‚Äôt give a shit about any of that and just want someone who is genuine.

Trump can do this. He can talk about doing a line of coke on a podcast. He can talk about golf. He can talk about cars. He can talk about whatever the fuck the other person is interested in. In sales, if you want to be someone‚Äôs friend and get the sale, whatever they want to talk about hobby wise, you are going to sit there for the next 20 minutes and fucking wax poetic about how cool cars are or some shit.

Meanwhile, what do we actually know about Kamala? In fact, do you know how well equipped she was to be casual? This bitch worked in McDonald‚Äôs as a young adult. Go fucking bitch about how awful that job was like every other person who walks away from it. She never could because god forbid McDonalds stops donating to them and the young audience she should be relating to doesn‚Äôt relate to how grueling and awful being in a minimum wage dead end job is. 

Instead, she doesn‚Äôt capitalize on that life experience and she lets Trump overtake her on the McDonald‚Äôs thing because bro actually shows up for a fucking shift on camera at McDonalds and then looks super personable toward the people going through the drive thru window. Forget about how that was all staged, it‚Äôs all about the impression he gave doing that.

2 reasons.

First of all, democrats just don‚Äôt wade into media as much. The old argument was, they were too busy legislating while conservatives only had to obstruct. It‚Äôs a different amount of effort. So conservatives literally have more time to tour.

And secondly, and perhaps even more cynically, legacy media industries and businesses are a huge component of democratic donor support. They ain‚Äôt biting the hand that feeds them.

This trouble would be greatly alleviated if the Democrats ran on easily defensible working class principles rather than whatever cobbled up stuff Harris ran on, some of which directly contradicted long standing Democrat stances such as lowering oil production or fighting against rightwing border policies. 

Another thing you see in many of these podcasts that Trump was on was that it was very light on policy and politics. A lot of personal conversations and talking about random topics. What you got to see was Trump as an approachable, friendly person. The potential trouble you can run into with ""left-leaning"" podcasts is that you have a lot of political talk show podcasts that talk left wing politics all the time, which most people would think of when they think of left-leaning podcasts, and that would stop the the sort of friendly, easygoing conversation that Trump had with Theo von or Joe Rogan.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Also, the people that go to her rallies were already going to vote for her. She had a golden chance at reaching millions of undecideds and she chickened out.",2024_11_11,17_08_15
"Rogan is nothing if not impressionable. His exact political positions are hard to pin down but he tends to change his options at the drop of a hat depending who was most recently on his show.

That makes his show a convenient place for anybody to spout their beliefs because he will be a mouthpiece for basically anything. Had Harris gone on the show after Trump and gave it a half decent effort, there's a pretty good chance he would have complimented her, repeated her strong points or possibly even endorsed her instead.

How a man with basically no strong political opinions of his own became the de facto political spokesperson nwlforca whole demographic, i'll never know. But underestimatimg his usefulness was a huge bounder for Harris.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

It‚Äôs been notable that he has said he has been duped by a couple people who came on and will call them out if they are just using him. It‚Äôs why the Harris team was so dumb on this issue. And it wasn‚Äôt a last second thing he had been saying for a bit it was available. I‚Äôm happy he didn‚Äôt go to their team and do a hour like they requested.

To be completely honest though, after seeing stuff like his lowering the cost of prescription drugs bill catch a 1-99 defeat, even if he‚Äôd have got elected I am pretty sure Democrats would have voted in lockstep with Republicans on anything game changing.

The Democrats want to cash the same checks the Republicans do, and Bernie doesn‚Äôt cater to the Citizens United crowds. He doesn‚Äôt even seem remotely interested in it.

There are journals and papers that can afford it, but not many unfortunately.

One thing that is interesting about Rogan / live podcasts, is they stop the show to look things up. I think it's actually the best way of fact checking. It's more natural, it's how you'd handle a disagreement in real life, you stop the conversation and everyone waits while you look it up. This often then finds the root of the disagreement, that people are looking at different sources for facts, which moves the conversation forward to that issue.

That being said, if you're complaint is that they usually look up dumb videos or don't have experts on that point to good sources, yes that's an issue.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

""Harris/Dems shouldn't be so negative about Trump supporters, it drives them away."" All Trump does is say negative stuff about Americans who don't support him. A lot of what works for Trump works because his image is that he's not a politician (obviously, he is one, but his supports don't see him that way). Trump doing his little dance on SNL in 2016?

Because every Democratic primary in recent years has resulted in the person with vastly more votes becoming the winning candidate.

The delegates were free to vote however they liked, and Harris was simply the only realistic option as his VP. 

But yeah, in 2024 Biden won in a landslide victory, and when he dropped out, his VP took over the ticket after winning nearly every delegate.

Joe Rogan's whole show is a completely different thing and only his listeners/podcast junkies know it. It's a whole new form of media.

I listen regularly and love the show. So many amazing episodes with really really interesting people. He is only seen in negative light by people on the left who believe the mainstream media's branding of him. Which is annoying to me, who has really enjoyed his show.

And Joe Rogan is so big now that comparing him to anyone else is lossy and would not make sense.

He built his own thing, and it's massive, and should be analyzed in it's own right. Comparisons to others inherently do not make sense as no one else has done something like he has before.

He also told his party to block any lame-duck judicial appointments the Biden administration tries to push through.

"So, slightly different perspective, we all know that Trump is ultimately reactionary and spews out stuff when he is faced with confrontation (usually after the fact cause he‚Äôs a cowardly bitch).

So someone or someone‚Äôs said that certain people he wants couldn‚Äôt pass even with a Republican Senate. It would also line up with a few MAGA aligned people saying they support Scott as Republican Leader (my bet is that it will be Thune). See Congress, particularly the Senate, don‚Äôt like recess appointment even with friendly Presidents from their party.

The problem Trump is having is he thinks that because he won that means he everything is perfect, but this election is turning into being way messy than on first glance. His victory seems to be with a lot of soft voters that can (and more than likely) turn against the Republicans as we are seeing a lot more people just voted in the Presidential race. Most of the Republican Senators remember how the 2018 midterm went and are probably worried if they don‚Äôt rain it in a bit (or some) they will be decimated, not even including the House.

It would not be shocking if there is internal chaos right of the bat with this second Trump term.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"I want nothing more than for them to get caught cheating. I may have to call the doctor because my erection will last more that 4 hours.

Let's play a game! Follow along. 

A not-insignificant number of states opted to purge voter rolls within 90 days of the election, prohibited by law.

We have had record-breaking numbers of President 'only' votes in 2024. 

Elon Musk touted several times that electronic voting machines are easy to hack and that his companies could do it. Rumor has it that he called the election with confidence 4 hours early.

A bomb threat was called into Georgia in a primarily democratic district - attributed to Russia, of which Donald Trump is an alleged asset.

Texas AG McLimpDick tried to block poll watchers and surveyors from the election cites. Sorry, block Democratic poll watcher. He also bragged that in 2020 Biden would have won Texas if not for his policy and action.

In 2020, Trump was caught on tape with two swing states outright asking them to cheat on his behalf. Georgia and Arizona. If you haven't watched Stop the Steal on Netflix, it was made by Republicans. In Arizona, our House speaker denied Trump the votes he asked to be 'found', with several other GOP officials pressuring Speaker Bowers to not certify the results.

Trump and his ilk cried that the 2024 election was rigged. All calls of election interference stopped almost immediately. 

Between 1 and several flash drives containing vote counts in Pennsylvania went missing or were delivered corrupt without data.

I believe it is extremely important to understand that if Trump lost in 2024 he is going to jail for the rest of his life. He's shown he has the capacity to cheat, whether it's in business, politics, or golf. Similarly, Elon Musk claimed that if Trump lost, Elon would also be in prison. When the punishment for cheating and the punishment for losing are the same, they do not (and have repeatedly shown) have the ethical integrity to stop themselves.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Trump is actually a pretty weak and pathetic guy. He's incredibly insecure, gets easily pushed around - by his advisors, random celebrities, foreign dictators, etc., and he's such an idiot he fails at almost everything. 

This isn't some strong brilliant dude... It's the opposite. Trump is like the fat kid in middle school who's an ass because he's a moron and he doesn't know what else to do. 

Most of this is pretty obvious. Hell just look at how he reacts when people make fun of him. He spent years randomly pointing out how big his hands are because somebody made fun of them. He's a weak, weak, pathetic man. 

He's mostly only famous from the Apprentice, which portrayed him (with considerable effort) as a smart and tough business man. He's whole make up is a facade and I can't imagine it's really that hard to show it.

"In 4 years Biden appointed 213 federal judges. In his 4 years, Trump appointed 220. Both of those numbers are higher than what Obama, Bush, and Clinton accomplished in **8** years.

Biden did damn well on judges.

Edit: also, Obama left 105 vacancies for Trump. 47 isn‚Äôt bad at all.

Edit 2: You know what, I was wrong. Obama had 320 judges in 8 years, but only 55 appeals court judges vs trump's 54 in half the time. Bush had 322 total, and 62 appeals court judges (8 years), and Clinton 366 total and 66 appeals court judges (8 years).

There was an, IIRC, 17% judicial vacancy rate at one point in Obama's administration, that's how much the GOP was sandbagging on appointing judges.), ""presidential immunity,""  the rulings against enforcing the insurrection clause of the 14th amendment, delaying Trump's sentencing, qualified immunity for police,  January 6th,  the lack of sedition charges or deadly force used against people who attacked the capitol, the mocking of a home invasion of the 2nd in line to the president and the assault on her husband...

He tried to overthrow the country 15 years before kristallnacht.   He became chancellor 8 years before kristallnacht.  These were not isolated events, there were signs,  people who held their noses as anti-democratic antics and rhetoric and rulings became more and more widespread in germany and waited for it to blow over, little measures like having  inspections more and more frequently at jewish businesses, well before bans on property and violence took place.

"Exactly. People are selfish and particularly more selfish when they and their families are suffering. Many here are probably doing well enough that inflation hasn't screwed their lives. Those who voted for Trump blame Biden and Harris. 

What they don't realize is that the administration handled it as well as they could have and brought down inflation and have the economy in a good position. It's ironic only Harris's policies would actually help wages increase to make up for inflation. 

While Trump's policies will wreak havoc on the average person's financial situation and make the wealthier a lot more money. Luckily you can't trust a word he says so hopefully some of the worst economic policies won't come to fruition. Although he will certainly be in it for the rich. 

All other reasons for the loss are not that consequential. People blaming us for being too liberal, woke, identity politics, or all these other wedge issues are pretty irrelevant. It's all noise. 

The highest topic on virtually every exit poll had the economy at the top then democracy, followed by a smattering of other issues with low percentages. Trump won on the economy because he wasn't in power when people were wreaked with inflation. Simple as that.

Hindsight is 20/20 but it seems pretty obvious now. The number one issue the Democratics should have been campaigning on was the economy. Poll after poll had it as the top issue and Trump had the lead.

MAGA is a weird Christian Nationalist coalition propped up by low information voters and anti-democracy billionaires, but their actual policy, when laid out, is supremely unpopular.

Democrat policy is extremely popular- democrats are ineffective and have shit messaging. They have a humiliation fetish and love to act like feeble pussies any time something dire is on the line. Their most recent notable achievement was the ACA, and the most popular aspects were watered down from the start and have just been allowed to be slowly dismantled. They STILL can't even widely get the message out Obamacare and ACA are the same thing.

They never shore up or brag about their achievements. They're so easy to just bully and push around- it feels like theyre a false opposition when it really matters.

And Trump is in a position no other President in history has ever been in, he's a lame duck even before getting sworn it.

>In August 2017, nine *pro forma* sessions were set up to block President Donald Trump from making recess appointments. The concern was that Trump might dismiss Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and try to name his successor while Congress was in recess. *Pro forma* sessions continued to be held until January 2019. They were held on December 31, 2018, and again on January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, that lasted several minutes.

>On April 15, 2020, while Congress was holding *pro forma* sessions due to the recess during the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump threatened to adjourn both houses of Congress in order to make recess appointments for vacant positions such as the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Director of National Intelligence. However, the U.S. Constitution only grants the president the authority to adjourn Congress if it is unable to agree on a date of adjournment, and both Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that they would not alter the planned date of January 3, 2021.

"They're gonna do that. Voters vote against their own interest all the time. It is OUR job to convince them otherwise. For many voters, fundamentalist Christianity and white nationalism are the most important, while others just vote for the reds because they actually believe the economy will be better. So we already know the other side sucks dirty asspipe, so it is no use complaining about their voters necessarily. Haters gonna vote with hate. The only thing we literally need to do as an opposition party is to show swing voters and recently converted MAGA or Trump voters is to show them how truly fucked up America is economically. 

Example to give here is to ask some questions. Which issue is more important to voters: do voters want to hear about DEI, trans issues, and patriarchy, or do they want to hear candidates who talk about *BREAKING* the rich and elite from influence in national politics? Both of those can be worked on at the same time, but I do believe only one of those is important IN ORDER to achieve the other two shortly thereafter. There needs to be a strategy to link trickle-down economics with recessions and inequality. So far we haven't been able to break through. Some will never get it and that's whatever. But I know there is literally an OCEAN of potential voters that can be rallied from those who stopped giving a fuck. But if there is a recession during Trump's administration, it is imperative that Democrats get that grassroots ground game going with young people and middle aged. We've got to get after school and extracurricular programs going to foster culturally-blind (meaning no endorsement of people based on race, religion, gender, sexuality, identity) groups to support future expansions into unknown territory.

Trump literally started his blizzard of lies campaign four years ago.  And the attitude from the key safeguards (journalists, DOJ, Democrats) was just: ‚Äúlet him cook‚Äù.

Media actually aided and abetted his false propaganda.  DOJ was Federalist Merrick Garland.  And the Democrats had, and still have, not one single coherent and consistent voice calling out right wing bullshit on a daily basis.

Even the occasional Democrat who does speak up foolishly apologizes for shit that‚Äôs not even real, like the ‚Äúpainful inflation‚Äù.  It‚Äôs 2.3%!  Or the tyranny of having the best jobs economy since WW2.

And the Democratic self-sabotage is pervasive.  It‚Äôs idiocy like Nancy Pelosi saying Kamala needed more time.  More months of Oprah needling the bro community would not have helped.  Bernie Sanders criticism is equally dense and unhelpful.  Obamas predictably coming out at the very, very last minute and doing the least possible.  Dems defending off-putting people and messages.  Dems using the same chronic failures to run campaigns.  

This election was very winnable with two changes:  

* campaign to the persuadable demos you NEED, not the demographic that‚Äôs already 900% blue and voting
* set the right context in the years leading up to it.  Dems should have been megaphoning and hyping EVERY victory and accomplishment of the last 4 years.

If democrats shift right again in 2028 they‚Äôll be indistinguishable from pre Trump republicans.

Meanwhile, you have incredibly progressive ballot measures passing in RED states. Missouri and Alaska both passed measures that raised the minimum wage and gave guaranteed sick leave. The democrats should be running on these platforms.",2024_11_11,17_08_15
"Did the Dems win in a landslide in 2008 and 2012 by running a moderate to center-right campaign? The dems constantly reached out to conservatives and gave more concessions to conservatives to the point of adopting conservative agenda policy points like fracking and immigration/border issues. 

So, the republican party keeps shifting to the right, and the democratic party keeps shifting to the right to claw back people that left the far-right republican party. What does that inevitably make the democratic party? And why would leftists and progressives vote for a party that doesn't align with them?",2024_11_11,17_08_15
"Because there's no real inroads to make with people to the right of the democrats. Harris campaigned with the Cheneys. She flanked Biden and tried to flank Trump to the right on immigration. She boasted about being a gun owner and supporting the 2A. She said she'd be putting republicans in her cabinet. She touted the endorsements of half of Trump's former cabinet.

And for all that effort, she received no meaningful vote share from conservatives or self proclaimed ""moderates"". No change from previous years. Why would a conservative person ever vote for ""conservative lite"" when they can get the real thing from the republican candidate? I doesn't make sense and it's reflected on the scoreboard.

In addition to this, progressive populist economic messages poll incredibly well nationally, especially in swing states. Walz was the most popular person in this entire race and that's his whole deal. Minimum wage raises, paid vacation and sick days, union support, healthcare, etc. Trump floated a no-tax-on-tips policy and people went apeshit for it. That's an economic populist policy. Arguably a dumb one, but it plays to helping out people in service jobs living paycheck to paycheck. 

The last two democrats to run on some flavor of economic populism won (Obama's signature issue was universal healthcare, Biden had a couple things like stimulus checks he pointed to). People who pivoted toward the center as their campaign message (Harris and Clinton) both lost. I'm convinced that if Harris had the exact same platform, but pivoted to talking about her plans for rent relief, preventing price gouging, and minimum wage every five seconds that we'd have a different result. Bernie went from ""random independent senator"" to 40% of the primary vote by pivoting to ""millionaires and billionaires on wall street"" every five seconds and hammering minimum wage and healthcare. It is a message that people are eager to hear.

Something like 60% of this country doesn't vote. I think progressive economics can help activate people looking for a reason to vote. I don't think there's any real chance at flipping people who want a conservative, though, based on the last decade of voting results.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

A soft landing is an economic term to describe lowering inflation without a causing a recession.  By high rates I was referring to the Federal Reserve fund rate. It's a balancing act by the Fed. Too high and the economy grinds to a halt. Too low and inflation goes Zimbabwe. Fed's stated goal is 2% inflation for a variety of reasons.  When they raised the interest rate above 5% to combat 6/7% inflation Trump would have been calling for his death. Biden on the other hand weathered criticism for years even with other frankly amazing results.,2024_11_11,17_08_15

"I love that you have read the books and I do agree that power is actually the intention of these people. Understanding why higher taxes are an issue for billionaires will add further context to your knowledge. 

I will add further points below -

1. Historical tax rates and general math around it- US practices incremental tax rates. Before Ronald Reagan the top bracket used to pay as high as  ~70% taxes. I am using the numbers ad an example so don't quote for accuracy but understand. So if you made a billion dollars your income above say 400k would be taxed at 70%. Last time Elon musk revealed how much he paid in taxes someone pointed out that he paid only 11% of his annual income. So increasing the taxes for people making above 400k was an actual issue for Biden and democrats to run with. For context, Above 400k income individual is among top 5% approx. earners of US. I think increasing the tax rate for people above 400k year would greatly help the economy of US and will help bring needed equality. And can actually cause a significant dent in the money and power billionaires have.


2. ""Power is power."" - Cersei Lannister. And I agree with Cersei. We have an understanding in US elections money is a continuous source of power. If There are elections in US every two years so maintaining the control of the US elected leaders is driving a lot of spending on elections and controlling the leaders. So if there is a place where they might have less money to spend then they will be unhappy about it.

3. Greed cannot be underestimated and they are not idiots. Billionaires don't even donate without getting something in return.  - ( watch John Oliver episode on philanthropy of billionaires). Even spending a few millions more Bezos can staff warehouses well enough to give the workers break for going to toilet. This would also help the workers he makes money from happy. You think he will be happy with increased taxes causing him inconveniences and reduced spending? There is a reason why Koch brothers et al fought to ensure that elections can be bought and that too by spending money.  Lobbying is not free speech it's actually bribing in a fancy dress.

4. Do watch documentaries like Saving Capitalism by Robert Reich as well. It will further add context.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"From Rolling Stone's Peter Wade:

Rep. Jim Jordan was a key figure in Jan. 6 and the attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election, claiming there was widespread voter fraud despite all evidence to the contrary. So it‚Äôs certainly a change of tune when the Republican congressman acknowledges the 2024 election was free and fair. The notable difference between these two elections is, of course, that Jordan‚Äôs preferred candidate won.

"Republicans have controlled the house for the last two years, they investigated anyone named Biden, had hearings to allow Bret favre to announce he has Parkinson's so we all forget about him stealing money from the state of Mississippi, there was the two weeks where they convinced all the fox news viewers that aliens were real and the government was covering it up.. hell they started an impeachment proceeding against Biden and two weeks later said ""yeah we don't really have any evidence or reason really to impeach, so I guess this kind of just falls apart now""


But not a single hearing or investigation into the 2020 election? Why? Because they knew they'd find nothing, they knew they'd just sound like kooks. Jim Jordan was never ""worried"" about election fraud, none of them have ever actually believed the things they convinced the rubes of.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"Take a look at the comment section in this post‚Ä¶. Tell me this isn‚Äôt weird.

This is like 2k comments from different voters in the USA all with similar stories about how they voted and then checked and they aren‚Äôt registered to vote now, or that they never got their ballot, or they were rejected because of signatures or other technicalities‚Ä¶ very similar stories depending on the state or if you were living abroad and voting by mail‚Ä¶. Like across the board. 

Not trying to be all tinfoil hat, but I have certainly never seen something like this here on a scale like that. I even started looking at accounts to see if they might be bots, they appear to be overwhelmingly genuine accounts.

Someone should make a maga thread just asking people to share the status of their ballots after they sent them in or voted.

Here is the problem I see with this though: even if someone investigated and proved it true, how would the democrats approach that without it being thrown into their faces as proof they were crooked the entire time. Trump very carefully sowed that field with seeds of doubt. In the extreme scenario of it being verified, Biden could choose to not certify but again with the fields trump has planted that would almost certainly lead to validation of maga even more.

Alternatively, when the republicans were crying election fraud, it was just comment sections filled with people having the opinion there was fraud and no stories on a scale like this in the link I gave‚Ä¶ infact in that same link, there are a lot of users saying ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need to copy them‚Äù arguing against it‚Ä¶ like polar opposite discourse.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"> Yeah you‚Äôre probably right about the Chad thing, but I know it was the Dems trying to throw out my absentee ballot from being an oconus service member at the time.

So you are ""probably wrong"" about one thing, but ""know"" something else that is also misinformation.

>It‚Äôs not like Dems are above rigging an election. They‚Äôve rigged every one of their own presidential primaries since 2012. And that‚Äôs their own voters they‚Äôre cheating. They wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to cheat in the general election.

Primaries are a very different beast. They are internal party political machinations that follow different rules. They have never been purely democratic, and were never meant to be, otherwise having them tied to the party would be pointless. They'd just essentially be semi-finals. Now we could argue the merits of this system if we want, but it's a very different thing than rigging popular vote totals or otherwise directly trying to change the outcome of a general election after the
votes are in through direct falsehoods and concerted effort across multiple states and levels of government.

>When all of the normally reliable bellwethers were wrong. 

Like what? It was, and still is, an unprecedented time.

When Republican observers were getting kicked out of counting centers while the count was still happening. When they changed laws in local governments that would also just happen to facilitate ballot stuffing.

""Observers"" were kicked out for not following the rules in place to *prevent* corruption of the count, and completely misunderstanding what their job was, with some being there completely illegitimately. What examples do you have of local governments facilitating ballot stuffing?

The US Secretary of State does not have the ability to make sure state and local governments are running their elections properly if those local authorities have committed to malfeasance.

"Libs (progressives far less so) are overwhelmingly snide, condescending, and quick to label anyone who doesn‚Äôt pass their purity test as ‚Äústupid‚Äù or ‚Äúuneducated‚Äù. This sentiment is not reciprocated towards democrats by most (non MAGA) Republican voters.

Libs are essentially an accelerator for the right, as they continuously ridicule everyone outside of their bubble - including fellow progressives - which has only perpetuated the stereotypes and infighting that ultimately led to the loss of working class and other major formerly reliable voting blocs. There‚Äôs only one other option for these voters to go in our zero-sum two party system, so they chose the other party.

The Dems are so out of touch with everyday Americans that they fumbled messaging, outreach, and representation on a staggering scale. Hopefully this either leads to a collapse of the party altogether to make way for a TRULY progressive party that represents the economic wellbeing of the working class, or a fundamental restructuring. But the sooner progressives separate themselves from libs the better our chances to win back the people we claim to represent.

We need a fiery, tough, younger, male to lead the dems. I voted for Harris and I‚Äôd do it again. But it was worried she didn‚Äôt have enough buy-in to get elected.

Men are really frustrated now a days and are tuning out. Men just want to be loved and its hard to find that now a days. In tv and commercials men are portrayed as morons or just sexist perverts.

        1. Mental Health & Suicide Rates: Men account for a high percentage of suicides in the U.S., often linked to societal pressure to ‚Äútough it out‚Äù and avoid seeking help. Men are less likely to seek mental health support, which leads to unaddressed depression and anxiety.
	2.	Workplace Fatalities: Men disproportionately work in dangerous industries (like construction, mining, and logging), leading to higher rates of workplace injuries and fatalities.
	3.	Homelessness: A large majority of the homeless population is male, often because of factors like job loss, family breakdown, or mental health issues.
	4.	Educational Disparities: Men are now less likely to complete college than women, leading to disparities in higher-paying job opportunities and contributing to a cycle of economic hardship.
	5.	Physical Health Issues: Men are more prone to conditions like heart disease and are less likely to go for regular health checkups or screenings, often due to stigma around seeking medical help or prioritizing work over health.
	6.	High Incarceration Rates: Men, particularly men of color, are disproportionately represented in the prison system. This can be linked to social factors, systemic bias, and economic hardship.
	7.	Substance Abuse: Men are more likely to engage in substance abuse, often as a way of coping with stress or trauma, leading to health issues and further social problems.
	8.	Custody & Family Law: In family courts, men often face challenges in gaining custody of their children, leading to struggles with maintaining family relationships post-divorce.
	9.	Economic Pressures: With the traditional expectation to be the ‚Äúbreadwinner,‚Äù many men feel an intense pressure to succeed financially, which can lead to anxiety and burnout.
	10.	Lack of Emotional Support Networks: Many men feel they don‚Äôt have close friends or a support system, as men‚Äôs social connections tend to decrease with age. This isolation contributes to mental health struggles.
	11.	Social Stigmas Around Masculinity: Expectations to embody ‚Äúmasculinity‚Äù can pressure men into suppressing vulnerability, hiding mental health struggles, and avoiding certain hobbies or interests that aren‚Äôt seen as traditionally masculine.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

These particular voters trusted Trump on the economy, thinking that he did a good job when he was president, but they dislike his demeanor, style, etc. They are basically saying they are holding their noses about the Trump character and voting for him because they do trust his business/economic acumen.

But the bigger point is that they feel the democrats failed them on the economy, so they are going to vote for something (anything) else. Nikki likely would have won by a larger margin.",2024_11_11,17_08_15
"Thank you. So tired of this simplistic lumping.

the reason the Republicans won is not just one reason. There are many reasons.

And that not everyone who voted for Trump did so for the same reasons?

The other distraction I see people making is they fixate on the most extreme MAGA voter, and say that‚Äôs why we lost. We are never going to win those voters, but we don‚Äôt have to. We only need to pick up 5 million voters in a nation of 330 million people to win an election. We don‚Äôt have to convert all of our irremediably racist uncles. If the Democrats could‚Äôve switched just 2 million Trump votes (3% of his voters), and attracted only 2 million non-voters (which is only 3% of the 120 million people who didn‚Äôt vote) to show up and vote, then it would‚Äôve been a big Democratic win.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Smart people see that in 1968 you could be a janitor and own a house and raise a family and even have the wife be a stay at home mom and still have a very successful life.

In any major city or even in the suburbs, any college student coming out of school can see that by the time they are ready to start a family and buy a house they will be paying $1.2 million. 

What that means is that you have to have a $250,000 income just to own a home. 

This is so fucking far out of reach for any human being in the normal sphere of daily reality. 

There is absolutely no hope for the future for most people coming out of college.

I‚Äôve heard so many comments about podcasters and the fearmongering, but I think those are 2 separate issues working in tandem.

But it‚Äôs the young ones they took for granted, and didn‚Äôt have the empathy to understand why they were in danger.

If you‚Äôre 22, you‚Äôve seen 3 elections since you were 10, and Obama was president. You‚Äôve seen a profoundly broken system, and two major candidates in that time who stood for real systemic change. You saw the Republican party empower their candidate to fuck up the system, and you saw the Democratic Party fight tooth and nail to keep anyone from really trying to reform the system, Bernie being chief among them.

If the lack of modern media presence is blamed, then that's where the money goes next time, and any consultants who don't embrace that don't get as much money.

We can go back to the days when the average ceo made 50x what his employ made not 400x,2024_11_11,17_08_15
"My grandfather ‚Äúmade his bones‚Äù in the mid 70s. He was born in the 30s, educated in the 40s & 50s, & started a mid-level insurance job with practically no mobility. After working that job throughout the 60s, and along with my grandmother who was a public school teacher, he was able to finance & open up his own independent agency. 

He wasn‚Äôt exactly Scrooge McDuck, but he did well enough to have a beautiful home in a nice neighborhood as well as a vacation home, and that was with 5 children to feed. His sole employee, a secretary, had two children & owned a 3 bedroom house with a pool along with two daily drivers & a summer convertible. By the time he stepped away, I‚Äôd say he retired with around $2 million; his secretary eventually moved herself down to Florida‚Äôs gulf area. 

He was still a relatively ‚Äúrich‚Äù man, but what is impressive to me is the fact that this was actually seen as feasible; basically the pinnacle of the American dream (both parents died before he was 3; he grew up in extreme poverty). We might call people like this ‚Äúself-made,‚Äù but he had different advantages: New-Deal era, a strong social safety net, quality public education, affordable higher education, and all of the stuff that helped people along the way. His children had that too, and they all went on to be successful. 

Then, he started voting it all away in the 80s, and that $2 million or so I mentioned got sliced upon the crash of 07-08 after all of the fellas he voted for decided to deregulate the fuck out of the insurance & securities sectors. 

Then he voted for them again. 

And again. 

And again.

The bonus is that their schtick is stale after 8 years, their approval ratings were dismal in the first go-around, and the leader is 78 or older and not super engaged in anything except avoiding personal legal accountability for crimes.

Imo the size of the conspiracy required to pull this off makes it very likely there would be leaks.

Remaining votes are still slowly being counted across multiple states and his victory will probably seem like less of a landslide when all of the WC is done. 

The impression Kamala‚Äôs base was larger came mostly from ‚Äúvibes‚Äù and the hope that pollsters were overcorrecting for Trump after under-correcting for 2 elections, but the reality is they adjusted their models correctly this time. The exit polling lines up with election results as well.

If it is true, I have to imagine the Biden admin would be aware and do not see why Kamala and Biden both conceded so quickly without at least buying a few days by saying to wait until remaining ballots were fully counted.

"The claims of fraud here are off the charts and ramping up!

I can't believe how many people are just completely ignorant of elections and history in general.

There are people in this very thread arguing that if a state votes for one party for senate, and another party for president or governor, that is prima facie basically proof of fraud and very suspicious and needs investigating....

This happens like half a dozen times literally every election.

Just spend a few minutes on wikipedia, going back through past elections, and comparing the maps of the presidential results to the senate and governorship results.

You will see there is a HUGE disparity.

If 99% of America thinks men don't belong in women's sports and 99% of Reddit mods think having such a view is a bannable offence, you're going to create a lot anger of on an issue that is not all that important.

I'm worried about the Trumps getting back in the White House but I think of lot of people including Harris, Obama and Reddit have made a terrible misjudgement.

Ordinary people feel poorer and Trump has used the gender stuff to make voters think the Democrats are idiots.

China üá®üá≥- Taiwan üáπüáº? Will China move on the island if 60% tariffs mean the economic calculus is removed and replaced with pressure from a disgruntled population. Now does this tip it over? Idk only Xi will know it when the time comes.  But if North Korea pops off at the south and/or Iran at the US, Israel, or the straight of Hormuz or vice versa they may see it as a chance to move assuming we would not open ourselves up to a multi front war assuming we are pulled into either South Kore, which I believe we are treat obligated to? Taiwan going down also stunts the world‚Äôs technological advancement.

This is not exhaustive but it‚Äôs 2:36 AM and this election has emotional exhausted me so ending here but there is more. Concepts of health care, judicial warfare, retribution against his enemies, in fighting, chaos, and Trump himself shitting online daily riffing nonsense plans and being unaccountable. 

He will be bad, we are in danger, but he is incompetent and leopards will eat his and his supporters faces.

"I own a small business, nothing special, but I do source many parts from China that just aren't available from the US for any reasonable price. A single part made in China is $0.06 and USA made part is around $2.5-3. No amount of tarrifs will make me buy American as we just don't have the factories to make it cheaply for these parts. People don't understand that China has entire cities dedicated to making this, with entire government made supply chains that US can never compete with, nor do we want to. The US makes high margin, high tech stuff, and China makes low margin, lower tech commodity type things. We do different things, and that's OK because that's how the modern trade world operates.

I've already calculated that I will need to raise my prices around 20-30% across the board if the tarrifs hit. I WILL put disclaimers on the website and in the product literature explaining why.

At the end of the day, it does not matter to me unless it causes me to go out of business, which it might. Int he mean time, I will just raise my prices and the consumer will pay that.

People accuse me of supporting slave wage, and the reality of is that with China's cost of living factored, the workers make the equivalent of $15-17/hr USD.

"Deflation is bad because it harms the asset holding classes which have the power to push that harm onto the working class tenfold. Everyone makes and spend less, but if you have capital you can swoop in and buy while everything is low, thus making you even more money when the eventual recovery sets in.

Stagnation is bad because it allows the asset holding classes to continue to stockpile and draw wealth out of the economy into their own coffers. This will eventually lead to an economy with no velocity of currency and thus a total crash or recession.

Inflation is bad because prices rise and wages lag behind until workers can demand wages that meet their new needs, leading to a temporary decrease in the consumer confidence and their ability to save. This also benefits asset holders because their assets appreciate at or in excess of inflation, because earning increases temporarily outpace cost increases.

The tariffs would further contract our economy by about 1-2%. This means billions in reduced tax revenue.

"***From Rolling Stone‚Äôs Peter Wade:***

Sen. Bernie Sanders is standing ten toes down on his assessment that the Democratic Party lost the presidential election because the working class feels abandoned.

The Vermont senator, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, released a statement after the election stating, ‚ÄúIt should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.‚Äù On Sunday, he continued his criticism of the party.

‚ÄúHere is the reality, the working class of this country is angry, and they have reason to be angry,‚Äù Sanders said on Meet the Press. ‚ÄúWe are living in an economy today where people on top are doing phenomenally well while 60 percent of our people are living paycheck to paycheck.‚Äù

"I get Bernie. Hell, I‚Äôm on his side.

But sorry: the working class is a big whiny group that has created its own economic downfall. Democrats in the past have been neoliberal shitbags, for sure. Carter was the last pro-worker president though.

Reagan killed unions, killed regulations and ended safety measures of the market so billionaires could become richer. Sure, Clinton followed up the neoliberal agenda, and deregulated the banking sector. Bush followed up and helped create the disaster that was the housing and then finance crisis - where lower and middle income people became poorer and rich guys again got richer.

Obama was the first president again who tried to help working people. He wanted more regulations, a healthcareplan that would help working people (and it became that Republican abomination, and even then the didn‚Äôt help passing it.), Obama wanted to raise the minimum wage and wanted more worker protection. What did Congress, especially republicans, do? McConnell roadblocked everything. 

And what did Trump do? He rode on obamas policies, there was no wage hike, job hike or whatever, but the regular anticipated growth that already was visible under Obama. Trumps economy of 2017 to 2019 was the Obama economy. The one thing Trump did, was benefiting rich people so they could fuck over the working class more and more. Budget cuts, massive debt and all the other shit he did do.

And under Biden? Republicans tried to block his legislation, those there created jobs and reduced the inflation and created more growth - than on any other country on the fucking world. And then republican lawmakers, although voting against that, claimed to have brought money to their communities.

Yes, democrats aren‚Äôt socialists and not as good to workers as they could be. Republicans though are pure cancer to working class people. But working class people voting R have no right to be angry. For decades they made their bed. They now have to lie in it.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"While Sanders is right, there's a lot of emotional appeal that Harris got the brunt of that's just bad democratic attitudes to begin with.

Democrats are soft on crime, that's just the unfortunate reality.      
People are tired of stores closing in their community because theft has been functionally legalized.     
They're tired of endless videos of people getting shoved into the subway tracks and stories of people being assaulted by someone who has just been released for assaulting someone for the 7th time that week.

When the hurricanes came in and Carolina was flooded there were rumours all over the internet that FEMA was refusing to aid areas that were ""full of trump supporters"", they were called a bunch of liars for it, then FEMA had to fire someone just the other day for doing exactly that.     
That does critical damage because now you're just full of shit and they feel they're under direct attack, it doesn't fucking matter that it was actually just a few people going rogue. The damage has been done.     
When Trump cuts FEMA spending they're just going to say ""well fuck 'em they were only helping democrats anyway"".

They really hated when they were told gangs are taking over apartment buildings, democrats said that's a lie it's not happening, then they go on social media and see a video of a gang taking over an apartment building.     
Then they hear from terrified victims that it's been going on for months and the government refuses to stop it.     
It really doesn't help that the very next social media story is the government sending a kill team to take out a fucking squirrel.     
How the fuck do you think that looks? It makes the government look like it's being maliciously incompetent, that's what it does.

But even that stuff above is secondary and tertiary failure.     
For the primary failure you just take a look at the hierarchy of needs and you quickly see what people care about at a deep emotional level.     
What are the two first things?

1-Food, housing. They need to feel they have safe and secure access to the resources to live.

2-Safety. They need to feel safe.

You've already fucking failed because the biggest difference between Trump voters and non-Trump voters were that the Trump voter answered yes to the question ""have your financial situation worsened in the last few years"".

But the answer democrats, who claim to be the party of empathy and concern for others, gave to people struggling financially was ""Actually the economy is doing rather well at the moment"".      
So fucking what!     
That specific person isn't doing well, so maybe just tell them that you're working to raise wages and to curb inflation instead of just going ""well akcshually you're full of shit and your poverty doesn't exist"".

The very most important thing is to make sure people feel heard. That you're taking their problems seriously.   

I don't believe for a fucking second that Trump is going to help anyone, and his election is going to be a fucking disaster for the rest of the world, but the one thing he actually understands is that when someone has a low paying job and they have to commute to work every day then price of gas is a big fucking deal.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"It's also no accident that this stuff gets upvoted here during such a volatile time period.

This isn't new. I genuinely love the vast majority of what Bernie Sanders says, and he has sincere widespread support, but not necessarily the support to win elections. In fact, there's evidence that he gets propped up online precisely because of that fact. [This post from December 2019 predicted it](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditSafety/comments/e74nml/comment/f9vofle/) all before some of the craziest things we'd seen happened over the course of the next year.

And I can't help but notice how some of the tactics closely mirror what I've seen from disinfo campaigns and reactionary posters ever since. Russia loves to boost MAGA, but they don't 'only' do that, they boost division in democratic ranks just as strongly, and push it by any means possible.

And I'm starting to believe we have no easy means to stop it. I've seen it play out for 3 major elections now, and each time it has serious real world consequences, whether the Democrats win or not, and it always benefits Trump or Russian geopolitical talking points when it does. And hell, even if it wasn't really a psyop, or it was all organic, it points to how deeply dysfunctional the democratic coalition online with the (what I presume are mostly) 44 and under crowds.

I don't know how we fix this anymore. Frankly, I'm kind of disillusioned with the whole thing. The one upside is that our downballot races actually performed well with the exception of Ohio's Senate race. Losing that one truly sucked.

"I think you may be and a lot of people in the party are missing his point. He even agrees that Biden did some baller things but he's talking bigger systemic picture. It's great to offer small business loans, stabilize inflation, get some manufacturing re-shoring legislation but this is all 'smaller' stuff working on improving incrementally which is great and Biden did do a lot of good stuff but people have been fucked for years now and we've seen people want anti establishment politics now. 

For example, none of our candidates have run on something like universal healthcare despite like 77% of dem voters want it, because the healthcare industry is fucking them over. They're angry and nihilistic and not motivated by a party that isn't giving them big policy changes. The dem party is still in bed with billionaires and refusing to address the elephant in the room that the system is fundamentally broken and people want it torn down instead of middle ground policy changes. 

Trump managed to grab onto this and become the republican tear it down, fuck the system and establishment and his voters responded to that. They're going to get fucked by him but he's at least saying what they're feeling in that broad regard.

I've been seeing a lot of people on reddit and on talk shows saying the voter is just an idiot or we need to be even more centrist which seems like a good way to keep losing support.

We've seen rightwing populism get their voters to turn out but dems refuse to run on left wing populism and actually promise people the big systemic changes they want.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Harris didn't have good proposals. That's the problem. She had boring status quo nonsense. She was unable to separate herself from Biden and his sub 20% approval rate.,2024_11_11,17_08_15
Blaming the GOP for misinformation and sane washing is like blaming a scorpion for stinging you. That‚Äôs what they do. Countering them with truth doesn‚Äôt work. You need to sling as much mud as they are. Appeal to the working class frustration and win them over. We need to push the working class against the billionaires instead of allowing them to be duped into voting for them.,2024_11_11,17_08_15
"The point of a campaign is to get people to vote for you. The Democrats had 8 years to either: 

1. Prosecute Trump for insurrection to the level that he can't run for office anymore, or

2. Prepare to dominate Trump in the next election.

Instead, Biden insisted on maintaining his egotistic second term run when their own records showed it'd be a disastrous loss. When he finally dropped out, they refused to give voters a choice and forced Harris in who was unpopular herself and performed poorly in her Primary. Then, rather that put forth any universal significant changes at a time when people were demonstrably done with the status quo, they decided to focus on converting two-time Trump voters rather than energize their base and non-voters.

The level of narcissism it takes to get blown the fuck out after running an awful campaign, and yet insist that you did everything right and it's the voters fault would make Trump himself blush.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Sanders knows that it would be lunacy to trust Democrats to push through a confirmation of her replacement. It's not that they are incapable of doing it.

We can't afford to let that happen again if it's in our power. If Sotomayor stepping down would be best for the country, we should say so and hope she hears us.

There's no shame in retiring for the good of the country. That's what Biden is doing, and he's been widely lauded for it. That wouldn't take Sotomayor away from your nieces or from you as an inspiration; it would merely add to her legacy.

All that said, I agree with Bernie here. I don't see a plan right now that would ensure Biden would get to confirm a new liberal justice if Sotomayor stepped down, so it seems like the best bet is for Sotomayor to hold on as long as she can.

">However, Sir Keir‚Äôs plan could be seen by Mr Trump as an attempt to undermine US foreign policy, which could antagonise him and threaten the relationship

Maybe the toadying little shits at the Torygraph could show at least a tiny bit of patriotism and acknowledge that we are not quite the 51st state yet and our government actually has the right to make foreign policy decisions independent of the United States? (~~Then again, the Barclay brothers who own that rag are so patriotic that they are Monaco residents because they would rather not pay taxes in the UK~~ - see correction below). 

Support for Ukraine has been UK government policy since the invasion, both under the Conservatives and Labour. It is absolutely in our own interest to stand by our Ukrainian friends because that war is practically on our doorstep and Ukrainian refugees are already here. They will stay here if they don't have a country to go back to if, as is likely, Trump will offer the Donbas to Putin as part of his ""peace"" proposal. To think that Putin's territorial ambitions will be over once he's overrun Ukraine is incredibly naive - something that we of all countries should be acutely aware of (cue Chamberlain proudly declaring [Peace for our Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_for_our_time)). It is also absolutely in our national interest to work as closely as possible with our European allies as Trump has [repeatedly threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/how-trump-destabilised-montenegro-with-a-few-words) that under his leadership the US will be too cowardly to stand by its Article 5 obligations. 

If Trump pursues his America First agenda without any regard to the responsibilities of the global superpower status that NATO has helped the US build over the last 80 years, we need to immediately scramble now and acknowledge the *geographical* reality that the safety and security of our country can only be supported by building strong security ties with our European neighbours. That means that we'll have to stop being Washington's poodle and actually put Britain first as well. And that can only happen in a European context. It's not us doing the undermining of our friendship with America.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"**From The Telegraph:** 

  
Sir Keir Starmer and¬†[Emmanuel Macron](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/11/07/trump-speaks-to-macron-before-starmer/)¬†are expected to plot a last-ditch attempt to thwart Donald Trump‚Äôs efforts to scale back US support for Ukraine.

The British and French leaders will discuss on Monday whether Joe Biden, the US president, can be persuaded to give Ukraine¬†[permission to fire Storm Shadow missiles](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/09/30/biden-allow-storm-shadows-fired-russia-helsinki-commission/)¬†deep into Russia, according to UK Government insiders.

The Telegraph has been told there are hopes in London that Mr Biden will finally give the approval Kyiv has sought for months in an attempt to secure his foreign policy legacy.

Talks will take place in Paris as Sir Keir becomes the first UK leader to attend the Armistice Day ceremony in the city since Winston Churchill in 1944.

The knock-on impact of the impending Trump presidency¬†[on the Middle East](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/10/whisper-it-but-the-middle-east-may-be-on-the-brink-of-peace/)¬†and the possibility of a trade war with Europe are also expected to be discussed.

The efforts come as world leaders attempt to work out how drastically Mr Trump, who won the US election last week, intends to¬†[change US policy on Ukraine](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/11/07/donald-trump-ukraine-peace-plan-british-troops-buffer-zone/).

Mr Trump talked about¬†[ending the Ukraine war on ‚Äúday one‚Äù](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-election-donald-trump-kamala-harris-november-5-issues/)¬†throughout his presidential campaign, leading to fears he will force Kyiv to accept land lost to Russia.

A senior Whitehall source said: ‚ÄúWe are very keen to make sure we can make the most of the time between now and Jan 20 \[when Mr Trump becomes US president\] and not just put everything on hold until the next administration.‚Äù

Another source said Mr Biden was expected to ‚Äúturn on the taps‚Äù by handing over more financial aid owed to Kyiv in the weeks before he leaves the White House.

Fears surrounding Mr Trump‚Äôs plans for Ukraine were fuelled over the weekend with news that Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley, two pro-Ukraine former cabinet members in his first administration, would not be given positions this time round.

Donald Trump Jr, the president-elect‚Äôs son, said there is¬†[no place in his father‚Äôs administration for ‚Äúwar hawks‚Äù](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/11/10/donald-trump-jr-mocks-zelensky-allowance-run-out/), in another sign a stark change in approach could be coming.

In a post on Instagram on Saturday, he posted a video appearing to mock Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukraine‚Äôs president, over losing his American ‚Äúallowance‚Äù when his father returns to the White House.

In the clip, Mr Zelensky looks unhappy alongside Mr Trump with the caption: ‚ÄúPOV: You‚Äôre 38 days from losing your allowance.‚Äù

"I mean Blair was under Bush.

Since then we've had

* Gordon Brown (Labour, 2007-2010) took over from Blair half way through as Blair said he only wanted to do ten years in office. Think of him as if Kamala took over from Biden in 2022.

* David Cameron (Tory, 2010-2016) Won on pinning the 2008 global recession on Labour, decided to quit after calling the Brexit vote.

* Theresa May (Tory, 2016-2019) Won an election but completely destroyed her majority in the process causing her to sign a confidence & supply agreement with a further right-wing party, effectively lame duck PM as parliament could not agree on a deal on how to negotiate Brexit thanks to the stupid 'red lines' the other party put in place to continue confidence in her. Eventually quit when she realised the date of withdrawal was coming up and nothing was in place.

* Boris Johnson (Tory, 2019-2022) Won election on 'Get Brexit Done', immediately pulled UK out of EU within a month, then Covid hit, became extremely popular until it turned out he was deciding to host sex parties in Downing Street while telling people to stay at home and not socialise which caused half his party staffers quit on him.

* Liz Truss (Tory, 2022) Elected by 100,000 Tory party members, immediately crashed economy by calling for tax cuts for the rich, removed after 50 days in office.

* Rishi Sunak (Tory, 2022-2024) Another lame duck as was stuck in a hard place of trying to turn the economy around while half his party decide to copy Trump's immigration and 'destroy the libs' playbook. Decided to run an election campaign that was so bad he ended up leaving the D-Day memorial in France early to do an interview about how he was so poor growing up he didn't have cable TV.

* Kier Starmer (Labour, 2024-) Won a campaign on being 'the sensible adult' with the 5th largest majority in history but so far seems to be pissing it away by not communicating strategy to the press, leaving much of our media to make up stuff about what he's planning.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Senate is 53 R - 47 D after the 2024 elections.

Dems need to flip 4 seats in the 2026 elections to gain control (with JD Vance serving as the tiebreaking vote, a 50-50 Senate is still Republican controlled).

Democrats have 13 seats up for election, Republicans have 21 seats up for election. But a lot of those Republicans are from ""safe states"" that have zero chance of flipping.

Here's how the map looks:

Safe Democratic: CO, DE, IL, MA, MN, NJ, NM, OR, RI

Lean Democratic: VA

Tossup: GA, MI, NH

Safe Republican: AL, AR, ID, IA, KS, KY, LA, MS, MT, NE, OH, OK, SC, SD, TN, WV, WY

Lean Republican: AK, ME, NC, TX

Basically, to obtain control of the Senate, Democrats need to **hold on** to all of their ""battleground state"" Senate seats (GA, MI, NH, VA), while at the same time, go on to **flip all** of the most vulnerable Republican seats (AK, ME, NC, TX).

Everyone is blaming everyone right now. This comment wasn't more leftist cannabalism; I'm just noting Bernie isn't winning in any real sense right now. This is a big loss for dem-socs across the US.¬†,2024_11_11,17_08_15
"Okay, I love AOC. She's a young, energetic, whip-smart firebrand that can energize progressives, even the prolifically hard to please far left. But again, we need to check our bubble. Look at how Bernie--the lack of the DNC's blessing notwithstanding--failed pretty soundly at getting the Dem nomination in 2016 and 2020. People just didn't show up in the primaries to make it happen. Then look at the campaign Kamala just ran. She was incisive, she was fun, she appealed to progressives on most all matters of economic policy without harping in polarizing ID politics or culture war stuff, and perhaps most importantly, she hadn't had the time to be demonized by the right as Hillary had through the 90s/00s. But finally, look at this last election. Trump won the popular vote. He made major gains in latino men, black men, even outperformed with women far beyond what was expected.


Do we really think AOC could do better, realistically? We might love her, but that's just our bubble. If we put ourselves in the shoes of all these Trump voters this election, do we honestly see those same people showing up for AOC instead of Trump? A hard pill to swallow is just how incomprehensible the myriad factors contributing to Kamala's defeat was. But one of those factors, a big factor, was her being a woman.¬†


I want a young dem-soc woman like AOC in the white house, of course. Desperately I do. But it seems unfathomable at this point how she could succeed in a general election, and heck, with the poor turnout for similar dem-soc candidates in past Dem primaries, it's hard to imagine her making it past recognizable names to the general in the first place.¬†",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Illegal immigration's impact...? Foreign influence...? What is he talking about?

Look, buddy, tell the truth. That you just want public schools to go away. Come out and say it. The rich kids will be fine with mommy and daddy buying their way into the best of the best private schools. The middle class, the lower class and the rural kids are screwed.

And those that don't make it?

Well, since you are getting rid of the immigrant workers and lowering the working age, you are getting what you want. A whole generation of new workers that are too young to form unions and speak for themselves in the workplace.

"You know what I find curious.  Slate and The Atlantic both published articles this year about the state of reading education in the United States, articles that argued that a large number of college students even at elite universities are functionally illiterate, unable to understand a couple dozen pages of text, and neither article had any concrete plan on how to fix the problem.

See ""The Loss of Things I Took for Granted"" by Adam Kotsko in Slate, February 11, 2024.

See ""The Elite College Students Who Can't Read Books"" by Rose Horowitch in The Atlantic, October 1, 2024.

What is even more curious is that for the most part, this has gone under the radar of the alt-right, instead of what I would have expected, being the subject of multiple videos digging out even more elaborate sources over the past few decades.

Because I suspect these articles were intended to convey a different message -- that a generation or two of Americans are for the most part going to be useless to compete economically with the rest of the world in a rapidly changing technological landscape that will require massive and constant re-education.  I think the message was sent to the establishment that America's peak military power is now, that there is no next generation, no time, that it is either use it or lose it.

Education in the United States collapsed a long time ago, and no one has any idea how to fix it.  There is no hope to compete with other countries advancing ahead technologically.

"There are not enough private schools to teach the millions of children across the country. Never mind private schools seem like a great alternative but that's because they have to compete against public schools *now*. They have lower classroom numbers because the majority of children go to public schools *now*. What do you think is going to happen when you get rid of public schools? You will have a flooding of private schools. Tuition will spike across the board because private schools will no longer have competition from public schools and they will use more resources because their classrooms will triple to quadruple over night. Those ""vouchers"" that are supposed to pay for tuition? They won't be able to cover it all. At most, they will be coupons. You, as a parent, will be on the hook for the rest. And even then, there are not enough private schools for all the children out there. Millions will not be able to go to school. 

It will be so much worse. Worse than you can imagine. Remember how hospitals were overrun during the height of Covid? Thousands died because there weren't enough rooms and staff? It will be like that for students and schools. Mind you, children won't be dying. They simply won't have schools to go to.

So while by nature of states rights, citizen tax bases etc this is actually fair, it will cause more division and rancor and further increase the economic divide which pushes sane politics driven by policy and reason further away.

"He‚Äôs not entirely wrong, but it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that the average American adult reads at a seventh-to-eighth grade level. So you have to approach an election trying to convince people with the intelligence level of a 13/14 year-old to vote for you. Most people on this app grossly overestimate the mental capabilities of the average American.

The Republicans lie, fear-monger, and insult their opponents, which is very effective when trying to convince someone who is the mental equivalent of a middle school student. Democrats have presented policy positions that help the working class. But many working class people vote for Trump and against their best interests because their understanding of politics, the economy, social issues, etc is that of an eighth-grade student.

I would argue that the system is working as intended. People in power want an uneducated and ignorant population. So while everyone on this app is freaking out about ‚Äúhow do Dems reach all of these voters?!?‚Äù You basically have two options:

1. convince them using tactics that work on 13 year-olds (lie, fear-monger, appeal to baser instincts)

2. start focusing on how to produce more informed, less ignorant voters (which, granted is MUCH harder than #1)

"The public and media needs to own why Trump wins.  

He has a large and more reliable base.  His floor is 30-40% from the jump.  There is nothing he can do that will stop them from walking on glass to vote for him.

The democrats on the other hand have a smaller base, think 20-25% and even that group is less forgiving than republican base of voters.  Democrats need to work super hard to improve turnout and try to get those independent voters to make up the difference between their floor and Trump‚Äôs floor.  

The independent voters are also right leaning and less forgiving of democrats.  It‚Äôs why democrats have generally won the presidency (with Bill, Barack, and Joe) after a republican fuck-up (economic slowdown, financial collapse/Iraq war, Covid/economic slowdown).  

Long story short. the math is hard for democrats and they need to work 100 times harder to earn votes vs republicans.  

People need to admit that and then they can post articles on how the Dems need to do better with the following:

Better messaging for policies that cover all groups, 

not focus on satisfying individual groups of the base, 

have much better communication between district candidates/polling and the general election candidate polling (this identifies ground realities overall)

"- ""In the Senate, in the last few years, we have not even brought forth legislation to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, despite the fact that some 20 million people in this country are working for less than $15 an hour.

I mean come on, can we at least base our criticisms on what's actually happening? By all means criticize the Dems who refuse to vote for it, but this is something that has been brought forth and the majority of Dems have been voting for it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raise_the_Wage_Act

And on a state level? The states with high minimum wages are predominantly blue states:

Meanwhile, Biden-Harris have also increased the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15:

Now, a Trump appointed judge is trying to reverse it:

https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-appointed-us-judges-say-biden-cant-dictate-federal-contractor-minimum-wage-2024-11-05/

Dems are far from perfect, but let's stop acting like they haven't been doing anything.

>taking on powerful special interests and fighting for you?

Biden-Harris have been doing that the past 4 years. Can we stop pretending they haven't? Biden's administration has inarguably been the most pro-worker/union president in recent times and he didn't get any thanks for it at all.

How about we acknowledge that the working class have also abandoned Dems? When you have the majority of union workers still support Trump despite Biden-Harris doing so much for them, I don't know how it's possible to still blame the latter.

And we can't lead a nation of children to a mature, reasoned solution.

This is particularly baffling because every grown ass adult at one point in their lives processes information at the level of a 6th grader. The solution for every single person was the same: rather than continuing to read children's books, we began to read more complicated books. As we were challenged to handle more complex information, our ability to process that information likewise grew more complex.

"Somewhere I saw someone suggest that social media has affected kids, because for the first time, kids are consuming content made by kids.

In the 90's, if you watched cartoons, those were made by adults. Many were required to teach important lessons. Sonic Sez, ""What did we learn today gang?"" type segments at the end of cartoons. Captain motherfucking Planet. Funny that show had diversity and nobody batted an eye, if you tried to make a show with a multicultural cast about environmental issues the R's would shit themselves screaming about the Woke Mob changing everything for the worse.

I digress. Compare that to today, where you have teen and young adult influencers being idiots, pranking in public, getting clout for it, and then you have teens and kids admiring these older kids as role models, imitating their mistakes (often crimes) and that content is what's being consumed by their peers.

"> None of that was actually anti-corporation

Sure, buddy. Breaking up monopolies is pro-corporation, actually.

> Half of those are currently pending in the courts and will eventually get approved

Nvidia/ARM was blocked and abandoned. Same with JetBlue/Spirit, Illumina/Grail, and Penguin/Simon&Schuster. On Microsoft/Activision, the FTC fought them in court and lost, and are now appealing, but they haven‚Äôt given up. As for the conduct cases, Google was just found liable for monopolization and faces a remedies trial next year. The DoJ also just had a second trial against Google, with the decision due in a few months. Pretty much every expert expects the DoJ to win.

> Was there any real pushback on the dozen or so pharmaceutical industry mergers? 2020 and 2022 set a records in the number of approved corporate merges, so honestly the administration doesn‚Äôt sound anti-corporation to me. The Microsoft/Activision merger was approved in October of 23.

2022 was a [record year for merger challenges](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/mergers-and-acquisitions/biden-antitrust-enforcers-set-new-record-for-merger-challenges), which means that merger enforcement was a lot more active than before. Also, it set a record for mergers reported, not approved. And, especially lately, the Biden admin has [been a lot more successful](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mergers-lose-their-shine-as-biden-racks-up-antitrust-wins-090057974.html) at blocking big mergers. More reported mergers are getting second requests from the enforcers, so industries are generally more reluctant to consolidate. Microsoft/Activision, as I said, was never approved by the FTC. The FTC fought it in court and lost.

They‚Äôre more than just ‚Äúcute‚Äù - EOs dictate how the entire Executive Branch works. Sure, this one will be reversed by Trump, but as long as Biden is president, his _entire government_ is working to promote competition and push back against consolidation. Think of how much rulemaking authority the executive agencies had (at least until _Chevron_ was overturned this year) and that power being brought to bear against monopolists. The example of Buttigieg‚Äôs DoT is just a small part of this. Sure, EOs are not law, but as long as the president that signed them is in office, they are powerful.

> I could go on and on about more local corporations being gobbled up and completely dismantled by hedge funds, but is there a point? Democrats are not corporations bestest buds, but that honestly just depends on the corporation and who they are donating PAC money to.

This is a stupid, cynical take. Sure Democrats are not perfect, but they are still _much, much more progressive_ than they were under Clinton or Obama. Just because you can point to some things they haven‚Äôt done, that doesn‚Äôt mean they haven‚Äôt achieved a hell of a lot under Biden.

"I think this election just proves that our politics and the electorate is just a rudderless pendulum.

There's not even a semblance of nuance or understanding for far too many. People just vote one how they perceive politics to affect their personal situation. That's it. If the economy is bad, rightfully or not, whoever is in charge will get blamed. If there's a pandemic, rightfully or not, whoever is in charge will get blamed.

"Failing to prosecute the crimes of the right wing (including, but not just Trump) is the biggest single reason.

Even if democrats couldn't win it in 2024, at least we might have had reasonable Republicans like Liz Cheney running instead of MAGA extremists.

Every Republican in Congress who refused to accept the results of the 2020 election should have been expelled from office. Trump's crimes should have been thoroughly, vigorously investigated and prosecuted, putting him in prison as soon as possible, and then every lead followed to get all the co-conspirators, accomplices, and accessories. If that didn't somehow include 5/9ths of SCOTUS, Trump's nominees should have been voided, or the court expanded. 

Democrats play a cooperation game every single time they play, trying to find common ground and compromise. Republicans play hardball and often employ violent rhetoric targeting their opposition as traitors simply for disagreement. Democrats have a reasonable platform but they do not know how to play the game to win by any means possible. They want to win cleanly, and perversely they love to give their opponents every chance to get back in the game and win, like they don't really want to win unless they win an infinite series of contests where they have to win every time, and their opponents only have to win once. 

Another big reason was failing to respond to the relentless negative campaigning Trump started immediately after leaving office.",2024_11_11,17_08_15
"On election day I was a poll worker in a diverse district of a blue state. Ballots are private, but people who aren't sure how to physically vote will often show them to poll workers for help. I was absolutely gob smacked by how many visibly Muslim people and how many Hispanic immigrants voted for Trump. These weren't protest votes, people seemed genuinely excited to be voting for him.

Going into this election, I really thought abortion was going to be the wedge issue that won it for Harris.  On female centric corners of the internet, abortion has been a central issue since Roe fell.  But clearly that didn't happen.

This idea that Dems need to speak more to working class interests and present a better economic plan.  Trump is not presenting a coherent economic plan.  That isn't why people are voting for him.

I think inflation played a role.  The average voter doesn't understand tariffs or who passed COVID relief.  Trump's tax plan has always benefited the richest Americans.

I think immigration played a role, particularly in states that have seen an influx from the southern border.

I think a lot of people don't want a female president.",2024_11_11,17_08_15
"It‚Äôs clear and was even clear before Bernie Sanders‚Äôs first run at office that working class Americans across all political spectrums are mad. Over worked under paid, watching millionaires and billionaires getting richer by the day and their PTO, pensions, benefits etc slowly slipping away. Then Covid hit and everything changed, it was no longer the same old cycle of corruption and inflation and then election cycle. Corporate greed kicked price gauging into next gear. And even when restrictions were lifted and we all went back to work they not only DIDN‚ÄôT take their foot off the gas they crept prices up more. Corporations were snatching up residential properties, housing and rent was unsustainable, interest rates were insane. Yet the economy is booming, Wall Street looks great, unemployment is at an all time low but you don‚Äôt see it, not if you make less then 100k hell maybe even a million. I own a business in Tallahassee my sales are down 11.2% for the entire year. Artists in my shop (some of which have been tattooing for 20 plus years) all say they‚Äôve never seen it so slow in their lives. Indicators of needs over wants indicators of where the general mindset of common Americans are at right now. Nervous and angry.

Then the 24 elections gear up and Biden makes a surprise move and steps down and Kamala comes in. I myself am surprised but also excited. I think she can turn it around I think she‚Äôs going to side step much of Bidens short comings (like age). She does well at rallies she does well campaigning she‚Äôs reaching many celebrities and her VP choice is a slam dunk (in my opinion). But then comes the debate with Trump, it‚Äôs her time to shine. She does fairly well but it‚Äôs missing something. I don‚Äôt hear anything about the price of food, of housing, of college, of gas. Trumps bumbling and dancing on stage for 40 mins but guess what else, he‚Äôs bringing up the price of eggs and bacon and gas prices. So much of what he says is brain dead and racist and borderline criminal but he‚Äôs saying this like the price of food and promising to fix it day one. So he‚Äôs essentially hitting two areas people are maddest about. The time it takes to change things and the outrageous price of living. If you were to equate inflation to wage ratio on a state to state level it would average about $16.50 a hour. Some states still have $7.80 hour. All while everything you can think of has risen in price. Trump tapped into that anger, fear and frustration of voters he would have never have, that were willing to look past who he was and what he‚Äôs done or would do in hearing the promise of immediate change financially. Do I believe it? Not a chance, he‚Äôs a liar and a grifting con artist but I also don‚Äôt live paycheck to paycheck check and I‚Äôm not blinded by desperation of that magnitude. Trump always had his cult of personality but he raked in new voters that are desperate and angry. The DNC had a chance in 08 with the Occupy Wall Street crowd they were ultimately disregarded, and again in ‚Äò16 with Bernie and we all know how shameful his disparagement of character was by the DNC and people close to him like Elizabeth Warren. Not giving him a fair shake caused a mass exodus of new and excited voters to the depression and hopelessness of them not trying to achieve big goals. Biden was a stop gap in 2020 but everything that has followed that has been so vanilla from Garland as AG to light touches with Ukraine. The DNC is far to use to playing it safe trying not to veer to far left or shakeup their corporate overlords. It‚Äôs high time they embrace working, middle and lower class Americans and adopt some real dynamic agendas to galvanize its base with younger, independent and undecided voters.

2) Information. The US has kneecapped its own education for decades now and has, in general, lost the information war. The republicans have FOX, democrats have nothing. They didn‚Äôt even ban TikTok and regulated Meta, X and so on.

Harris came too late to the game to earn any real points.¬†

Right wing has been putting a huge investment on propaganda on YouTube, tiktok and even edges of the Internet like 4chan (and the dark web). And it's not just American conservatives, but conservatives from the Middle East, India etc.¬†


Also the kids are getting dumber each year (covid only accelerated this) which is beneficial for conservative media because viewing issues in a black and white manner is easier to digest. This goes back to my third point with propaganda being pushed towards dumb underdeveloped teenage brains.¬†

The end of the fairness doctrine, the growth of wealth inequality, and Citizens United have sure reduced the idea of a US democracy to a hollow ghost of an idea.

"Bernie Sanders has, IMO, the correct answer.

Harris was claiming victory over the economy using the usual metrics: inflation, unemployment, stock market.

Yet what people are _experiencing_ is sticker shock at everything. The price of a McDonald‚Äôs hamburger tripling. College and health care unaffordable. Housing costs skyrocketing. And during this time they might have seen a 3-5% bump in their own income, if they weren‚Äôt laid off. Most Americans living paycheck to paycheck while the fortunes of the rich increased 1,000 to 10,000%.

Harris only had one vague solution to this, and that was to ‚Äúcrack down on corporate price gouging‚Äù. That‚Äôs an entirely meaningless phrase and most Americans (stupid as we are!) know better.

The real culprits go hand in hand. Like the game _Monopoly_, unchecked capitalism gives such an advantage to the rich that eventually a very few people own _everything_. They can buy politicians and rewrite the rules to their own advantage. One of the first things they did was neuter the _only_ counterbalancing force we had: anti-trust, or the ability to stop mergers and price fixing, and forcibly preserve competition.

It is _shocking_ how many industries have consolidated down to just 2-4 players, and use all sorts of tricks to hide that fact.

So the problems are income inequality, and the ease with which money buys legislation. And unfortunately _nobody_ in the core Democratic Party has been able to resist the almighty dollar. We can‚Äôt even stop Nancy Pelosi from insider trading.

MAGA just lies about the cause. It‚Äôs those illegal immigrants taking all your jobs and housing! And those woke pedophiles turning your kids trans or gay, or those liberal colleges teaching things we don‚Äôt understand, and those pesky women deciding they want a life of their own instead of breeding the next generation of hard-working ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Americans! And the solutions are simple. Build the wall! Ban everything woke! Deport everyone who looks different or speaks a different language!

Most Americans fell for it.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"15,000,000 democrats just didn't vote in 2024 vs 2020.  Nearly all Republicans that voted in 2020 voted in 2024 also.

Do you want to know why that happened?

Simple.

They all thought this election didn't matter.  None of them understood the gravity of the situation.

You want to do forensics on this mess?

Ok.

You should have spent 2 months telling everyone exactly what was going to happen to the nation, to the world, if anyone voted Trump.  This isn't ""oh, Project 2025 is bad.""  No.  This is telling them exactly what events happen and exactly what results happen, and you sugar coat nothing.  You present their future of this nation, of their civil rights, of their freedoms, and of their livelihood.  And then you zoom out and show what the world is like with Trump in power, how Ukraine falls, how Putin takes over land and pushes for more, how militarization grows.  You show what happens to stability in the world as the US pulls out of NATO of the Paris Climate Treaty, and so on.  You zoom in back home to the US and show exactly what attacks on federal departments like the EPA, DOJ, FDA look like.  You show them environmental protections removed and damage to wildlife.  Then you show them their money.  You show them what broad spectrum tariffs look like, how many thousands of dollars more they have to pay, that second job they'll have to get to cover expenses.  Show them what defunding of social security looks like, what the end of medicare looks like.  Show them everything that can go wrong and go BAD for them.

Have them comprehend the level of RISK Trump is to this nation and its people.

This shouldn't have been a message of ""joy.""  Joy isn't the thing that was going to win this election.  The right side has been told for 10 years how bad Democrats are and how much stuff they messed up.  You have to compete against that.  You have to show that Trump is worse than that.  And you have to be graphic and relentless.  You had to make up for 10 years of media in 2 months.  You needed to make snuff films, just go hardcore and make it count.  Shock and awe.  You needed it to be viral and unavoidable.

"I'll tell you where the Democrats went wrong.

Everything that came before January 6th of 2021 was a political debate but AFTER that?

The Biden Administration should have had Donald Trump, several Supreme Court Justices, and whoever else in the halls of power that clearly supported overthrowing our Democracy up in front of a Military Tribunal.

FULL STOP

That wasn't ""politics"" that was a clear and present danger to our Nation.

I get that it wasn't comfortable or politically expedient but it was an existential crisis to our way of life.

You go over to a sub like r/QAnonCasualties and you read the devastating effects that this sick and subversive, dark Russian and who knows who else's money disinformation war has created in the lives of average American families.

Meanwhile every single day even the regular news is non stop screaming OH TRUMP HAS DONE THIS!! AND NOW HE HAS DONE THAT!! and unlike the imaginary billions of migrants coming to eat your pets or the kids being given surgeries in school IT WAS A VERY REAL AND VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM...which the Democratic leadership harped on constantly. THEY RAN ON IT IN 2020 and we elected Joe Biden to deal with it in 2020, and that was BEFORE J6, BEFORE the stolen documents, BEFORE the one thousand other things that have been nonstop reported all day every day for four years now.

I do not blame Harris but the Biden administration sat back and allowed an extremely dangerous seditious movement to grow like a cancer in our society and they put some LITTLE folks in prison sure. But did they arrest ANYONE with money and power and influence?? No.

And acting like oh well the courts just can't take care of it was like THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE THE MILITARY COURTS FOR. Exactly what. For moments in history that aren't appropriate for the civil courts.

Four years of Trump followed by four years of GUESS WHAT HE AND EVERYONE ELSE WITH MONEY AND POWER ARE ABOVE THE LAW and we're not going to actually do anything about it so it's up to you guys!! VOTE HARDER!! is where the ""Democrats went wrong"".

It's where the entire USA went wrong.

You don't get to stand behind the Presidential seal and tell us repeatedly how there's a growing populist Fascist movement in our Nation who have clearly conducted criminal acts but it's up to you little folks to take care of it.

You better vote like your lives depend on it because they do!! Was a HUGE part of Democratic messaging for the last four years.

I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT WE ELECTED Y'ALL FOR IN 2020. 

Everyone is AFRAID and EXHAUSTED and the current Administration took exactly ZERO actual steps to put down something that they were glad to point at constantly as a reason we better continue to elect them.

Ignoring every other issue that is going on in our Nation, when you are in charge of the Government and you sit back and tell us that you're cool with leaving it up to us little people, and we don't have the police or the courts or the Military or any of the many awesome powers we've invested in the Government to protect us from this kind of sh\*t, and then you tell us VOTE HARDER OR YOU GET MORE OF THE SAME but all you've offered for us voting harder already is NOTHING...

Yeah that's where the Democrats went wrong.

So I hope they're happy that they looked moderate enough and that they left us to do all the fighting when they had all the power and failed to have the balls to use it.

If this is the end of the USA as we know it then it's not because people on the left didn't try hard enough. It's that WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN LEFT TO FIGHT BILLIONAIRE AUTHORITARIANS AND RUSSIAN PSYOPS alone. We shouldn't have had four years of Trump is untouchable but here's why y'all should vote for us to do nothing about any of it AGAIN.

I am so angry. The Biden Administration completely FAILED US. It would have been rough to clap Trump in irons two months after they took office but it would have been what was right and while Americans still had the insurrection fresh in their minds. 

Instead they didn't want to do the hard thing but that's what a President is for. To make hard decisions that aren't popular when needed.

It's not just ""Democrats"" that are under the microscope here. A massive amount of people are realizing that the Government that we spend so much time and money worrying about when our Representatives are supposed to be getting paid to deal with these problems FOR us are utterly useless in the face of an actual threat.

We have been invaded and they sat back and watched it happen. And now God help us all.

You don't get to allow this sh\*t to just go on and do nothing about it when you had the power to stop it and then wonder gee why don't people believe in us any more?

Because we are HARRIED and EXHAUSTED and BROKEN is why. Because out here in the streets we're being threatened by extremists with violent intent is why. Because women had their rights stripped away and are dying but they did nothing to react to that decisively is why. Because Trump or anyone wealthy are clearly untouchable is why.

Because they did nothing except tell us to save ourselves, is why.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

2016 Bernie would have beaten Trump and we wouldn't be in this mess. The establishment backed centrist Hilary and she got beaten.

2020 the establishment backed Biden who was already showing that he was losing his grip on his mental faculties. He won because Trump had extremely low favorability and because turnout was super high since it was during COVID. 

2024 Harris had huge momentum, with leftist Walz. Then they muzzled Walz, pivoted right, and immediately lost ALL of that momentum. This momentum loss has been super obvious and all the people that are surprised are living in a bubble.

Cracking down on corporate price gouging is at least a specific action you can take that's within the power of the presidency and doesn't rely on congress.   It's an actual thing that can be done and would help.

* Public companies are _required by law_ to maximize the short-term interests of shareholders. Customers made it clear that they would pay $18 for lunch.

* Could we root out corporate money and influence to the point where Congress would finally be willing to bust up near-monopolies?  Didn‚Äôt think so.

Conservatives can promise straightforward solutions because they _make up fake problems_.  Your burger is $18 because of filthy illegal immigrants. A wall will keep ‚Äòem out! Simple!

Enough voters didn't even know Biden dropped out lol you can't seriously expect normies to be watching Harris campaign rallies a week out, it's already decided at that point.

I hear you... I read a comment by another Reddit user a few days ago, and I have to agree with their realization:

We all thought Trump lost the 2020 election because he sucked and people finally realized that. In truth, Trump likely lost in 2020 because *life* sucked (due to the pandemic) and Trump just happened to be President at the time.

What that means is if Clinton had won in 2016, she probably would have also lost in 2020. If Trump had let professionals deal with the pandemic and 400k more people survived, he probably would have *still* lost in 2020.

I'm beginning to wonder if reelection is only possible outside of any significant economic issues at the personal level.

I keep thinking that Democrats should start having a primary every election cycle, even if they have an incumbent. But primaries really aren't going to guarantee that you get a candidate that can appeal to low-information and low-propensity voters, soo... 

Since the economy is tied (rightly or wrongly) to the current administration, maybe something even more extreme: no incumbents. Any new Democrat candidate would need to make it clear that they will deal with the current economic issue(s) that people are facing.

This could allow voters to express their dissatisfaction with the current Democratic President, while still presenting them with a Democratic alternative that would push for *mostly* the same policies, but would give people the choice of something different when it comes to the biggest perceived pain point(s).

Edit: Of course, the success of that will depend on if people are blaming the current *person*, or the current *party*.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

I used to work in environmental policy.  NGO's would always come to us with polls saying some big majority like 76% of people believe in Clean Air.  

We would show them a poll we did that had questions like ""Do you trust the EPA?""  ""Do you feel gas prices are too high?""  ""Should the government seek to reduce the number of SUV's on the road?""

So when you looked at the two polls, you could see that while an overwhelming majority of people believe in cleaner air, but they would reject any way to feasibly carry out the plan in real life.

Like if you proposed a Universal Healthcare plan, someone will ask ""Hey does this cover abortions and does it mandate vaccines?""  Or ""So Trump and RFK jr. (or AOC) will be in charge of this?""

Trumpcare probably inspires as much distrust amongst the left as Obamacare did for the right.

"I remember reading about a southern state - I think Alabama,  that decided to come down hard on all immigrants, not just criminals  - traffic stops on anyone who looked Hispanic, raids, etc.  and of course the immigrants left to pick crops in a different state. 

Well, agribusiness went crazy - their profits were rotting in the fields. But you have to be highly motivated to work in brutal conditions. Locals weren't interested . The state tried prison labor, but that didn't pan out. 

So they quietly rescinded their anti immigrant policy and invited the immigrants back in.

I don't know the answer to this.  Vance says we need to stop letting all immigrants in. He ranted against the legally  hired Haitian workers in his own state. ( They're eating cats and dogs!)  He says they are keeping wages low, keeping housing prices high. I don't get this one - houses are pretty much built by immigrant labor where I live.  As to low wages, Vance invested in a greenhouse in appalachia where the work was so brutal and the wages so low, Americans refused to work there. They brought in migrants. 

People have gotten used to cheap products, cheap food. Is it morally alright to use immigrants that suffer low wages and abuse?   If not,  are we ok with paying 10$ for a tomato? Who knows how much for a roof.  Att hired all immigrants to lay cable in my neighborhood. The people doing lawn maintenance are all immigrants. 

Of course Americans have complained about immigrants taking jobs for more than a century.  Chinese built the railroads, Italians and Irish built the NYC skyline, Indians are now building IT.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Trump meanwhile received 2.8m votes while the Republican senator candidate received 2.68m meaning 120k people didn't vote down ballot.

We could have easily advised the Russians to privatize their industry through ESOPs, employee ownership but we encouraged them to give it away in a rigged bidding process to individuals connected to Yeltsin and later Putin.

Uncontacted humans are communal, and their art consists of sacred runes, successful hunts, large hips, and higher life forms. The ancient caves do not portray slavery or kings as part of ancient man's lifestyle.

Thru archeology and observation, tribes carried the disabled over mountains for decades, downplayed success in the hunt, tolerated laziness, and showed restraint in moments of aggression. Most hunter-gatherers had clear rights to divorce, and queer expression wasn't uncommon or taboo.

"The facts are that Russia was in an artillery war with Ukraine over Donbas the entire time Trump was in office and gearing up for a full invasion likely sometime at least in 2020, if not earlier. During this time, Trump rather famously tried to extort Ukraine by withholding congressionally approved arms sales to the country in exchange for information on a political opponent, which is what he was impeached for. 

They needed this arms sale because they knew an invasion was on the horizon. All Trump did was try to sabotage Ukraine's ability to defend itself.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"From The Telegraph: 

Donald Trump ‚Äúwill hurt America‚Äù if he allows Putin to win in Ukraine, Nato‚Äôs top military official has said.

In the strongest criticism of Mr Trump‚Äôs so-called peace plans since he won last week‚Äôs election, Adml Rob Bauer said¬†[Ukraine](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ukraine/)¬†is of ‚Äústrategic importance‚Äù to the US.

He also warned that¬†[North Korea‚Äôs entry into the war](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/10/19/north-korea-europe-ukraine-russia-war-arm/)¬†on Russia‚Äôs side was a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù for the US.

It came as the Kremlin welcomed what it said was Mr Trump‚Äôs openness to a deal that could bring an end to the war.

Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for the Kremlin, said: ‚ÄúThe signals are positive. Trump during his election talked about how he perceives everything through deals, that he can make a deal that can lead to peace.‚Äù

Last week, Mr Trump was reported considering a plan that would freeze the conflict on the current front lines, with European peace-keepers deployed to an¬†[800-mile buffer zone](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/11/07/donald-trump-ukraine-peace-plan-british-troops-buffer-zone/).

On Saturday, Donald Jr, Mr Trump‚Äôs son,¬†[mocked Volodymyr Zelenksy](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/11/10/donald-trump-jr-mocks-zelensky-allowance-run-out/)¬†on social media, resharing a video that said Ukraine‚Äôs financial ‚Äúallowance‚Äù from the US is about to run-out.

In his first term, Mr Trump¬†[threatened to pull the United States out of Nato](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/07/07/nato-summit-fears-trump-may-pull-troops-europe/), calling on European nations to increase their own defence spending rather than rely on the protection of America.

Speaking at a defence summit in Prague, Adml Bauer made an appeal for the US to remain engaged in the¬†[Ukraine war](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/russia-ukraine-invasion-live/), saying it ‚Äúconnected to the rules based international order \[and to\] the heart of Europe‚Äù.

He added: ‚ÄúIt is connected to the ambitions of Russia, and indirectly, the ambitions of China. I cannot imagine that it is in the interest of the United States to allow Putin to come out of this conflict as a winner.‚Äù

Warning of Russia‚Äôs growing military cooperation with belligerent countries such as North Korea and¬†[Iran](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/09/iran-has-declared-war-on-the-united-states/), Adml Bauer said Russia‚Äôs export of nuclear and ballistic missile technology was ‚Äúa challenge and a problem for the United States‚Äù.

‚ÄúChina plays a role here as well. He \[Trump\] cannot solve Ukraine without looking at all these other plays as well, because otherwise the United States will hurt itself.‚Äù",2024_11_11,17_08_15

If he stood up to Putin and put him back behind his borders, he would be liberating a huge population of the earth (and the resources there).  Then he could do the same for Taiwan.    He would go down in history as a bridge toward a greater earth.   And he could pull it off because he is perceived as capable of breaking norms.

"Ukraine has more or less lost this war already. The high-water mark for the Ukrainians was the Kherson offensive. It's been nothing but bad news since. Despite their best efforts (and unprecedented external support), they've been unable halt the current Russian advance, and that trend shows no sign of reversing any time soon. Where are they gonna find the men and equipment necessary to counter attack while they're getting hammered like this? Any hopes of a sudden Russian collapse, or some sweeping Ukrainian offensive campaign are pure fantasy at this point. The writing is on the wall, and if you don't see it by now then I don't know what to tell you. 

There will be no shortage of reasons to revile and condemn trump in the coming years, but shutting down the war in Ukraine is not one of them. It's well past time to back out of this one. In hindsight, we never should've been messing around over there anyway. 

And no, despite what some claim, Poland and the Baltics will not ""be next"" when the war in Ukraine ends. Russia is not suicidal. They will not take on NATO and the US/UK/French nuclear arsenal head-on.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Fact of the matter is, hurting their neighbor wasn't a factor in voting for Trump. You didn't vote for Trump to help people. He takes full credit for repealing Roe V Wade. While it's true the supreme court were the ones that removed it, he was the one that appointed them. He put them in charge, these people who lied about it. These are the people that Trump puts in charge. The same people who let abortion laws get put into place in red states that have killed women. He proudly takes credit for putting them in charge and letting them perform such actions.

A Trump voter didn't vote for Trump because they wanted to help their neighbor. No, that played no role in it whatsoever.

The government selected plan D, then started cutting stuff from it).

Math seems to be the most important subject in our country. But I feel like education should progress beyond being sufficient in mathematics. Or just the basic level of understanding on the basic school subjects. I feel like it would really benefit the society if we dove into economic, social and political issues early. But this runs back to my original comment, half of the country is living in a world where most can‚Äôt afford $10,000/Yr college tuition. And that‚Äôs where most of that education comes from. 

But like you said, America has the lowest paid teachers of any western country. I have heard too many times of teachers who just come in to teach the basic needs just to collect their paycheck, particularly in public schooling. There‚Äôs very minimal interaction between teachers and students, they just give them a packet and tell them study it.

"\> most money is spent on war efforts so I‚Äôm focusing on that.

It's not, that's a meme.     
The US spends about 3.4% of GDP on the military (medical spending by the US government is 16.6% of GDP, for comparison).     
That 3.4% is higher than most but lower than for example Israel (5%) and most serious countries are about that level of percentage by GDP (South-Korea for example is a bit lower at 2.8% but that's not too far off).     
For an actually capable military you want to be at 3%+. Which is why France and the UK have failing ones at 2.2% and the rest of Europe is a joke with their less than 2% spending.

The US is about 25th on spending by GDP.

The return for the US military's activities is that the US is the center of global trade (there's a reason why it was called the ""World Trade Center"" and not ""those buildings were some trades are occasionally made"". While those buildings weren't actually by themselves the center of global trade, the United States is). Which is a natural effect of the US military being the de facto guarantor of international trade.

Nobody is planning on attacking Russia. Nobody is planning to use nuclear weapons on Russia. The nanosecond that Russia uses a nuclear weapon to escalate, the entirety of NATO will have free reign to incinerate every square inch of that country with their own nukes. That's called mutually assured destruction, and Putin is well aware of what will happen.

Stopping Russia in its tracks is only an escalation in the eyes of Putin, his propagandists, and American conservatives who've been listening to those paid propagandists. For everyone else who is sober, it's just defending sovereignty. Again, nobody is after Russia.

But since you mentioned it, lets talk about that nuclear arsenal. The few times the USSR agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenal was because they were so ridiculously expensive to maintain, even for them. The Ukraine was has revealed the state of Russian military hardware as overblown, faulty, unreliable. The same has been seen of their aircraft, submarines, frankly everything. How likely do you think it is that Russia has kept a perfectly pristine nuclear arsenal in reserve given the state of the rest of their military and rampant corruption?

Yeah, not likely. While I'm not trying to call them on it - because once again, nobody is trying to attack Russia - I can see a bluff for what it is.

"\> Did you perhaps forget that US has the largest GDP ?

No, in fact it's part of my argument above. That GDP is significantly a creation of US defense spending.

Remove the USs military position as the head of global trade and US GDP goes down significantly, the Dollar stops being default currency, etc. 

\> ¬†I‚Äôm not looking at US military spending based on GDP, I‚Äôm looking at extra funding they add to wars , check the cost of wars in Afghanistan, Iraq , Syria

Afghanistan cost about 2.3 trillion across 20 years (adjusted for inflation).     
That's about 100 billion a year. Which is about 1/9 (one-ninth) of US yearly defense spending.

\> how do you think US sent money and aid to Ukraine ?

Mostly it came in the form of outdated equipment that was in storage, which is a result US military policy being to always produce enough to keep production lines open. Which is a necessity for military readiness. If you don't do that you end up with the problem Europe is currently having, that problem being a need for production which largely no longer exists and cannot be scaled up in a reasonably time frame. Which is why Europe is panicking and is kinda fucked should Trump follow through on his threats.

Not a situation a superpower can allow itself to be in, so you were going to do that anyway.

\> These add up all the wars have added up to trillions extra outside military budget propositional to GDP.

Every conflict the US has partaken in since 9/11 has cost 8 trillion (adjusted for inflation).     
Which is a lot of money, but adds up to 350 billion a year across all fronts. That accounts for US DOD budgets, discretionary spending, special allowments, etc.

US medical spending, for which thanks to its horrifically inefficient system it pays 2 to 3 times what any other nation does per citizen (yes that includes states who just provide free healthcare to everyone), is about 4.5 trillion every year. Of which somewhere in the range of 50% to 66% is needless spending caused by bureaucratic inefficiency.

"The only deal I could imagine Ukraine would accept that involves freezing the frontline is one where 1. European troops guard the armistice line, and 2. Ukraine is allowed to continue building up its military and receiving weapons from other countries. This is essentially de facto NATO membership, only with some land lost. 

This is the deal Trump just proposed. Freezing the frontline by itself would not deter future aggression: Ukraine would need to be armed and trained to the level of functionally being a NATO military in practice and have a deterrent in the form of Western troops guarding the border.

The question then is if Russia would accept that deal. I saw an article where Putin said he was open to that deal, but here's why I don't believe him: Putin has repeatedly demanded in past peace negotiations that Ukraine should be disarmed and limited to an army of 85,000 troops, and he has repeatedly demanded the end of weapons shipments to Ukraine. He's also repeatedly demanded no Western troop presence in Ukraine, whether it be in the form of NATO or not. 

These are demands he's made in peace negotiations going back to the beginning of the war. It does not make sense for Putin to take a deal where Ukraine keeps getting armed, Western troops are directly stationed in eastern Ukraine staring face to face against Russian troops, and the Ukrainian military is allowed to grow. 

Remember that Putin has thrown hissy fits just over Western volunteers fighting for Ukraine in the foreign legion and Western trainers and engineers being stationed in Ukraine. He's thrown hissy fits over *every* single weapon shipment to Ukraine, from the smallest of small arms to the largest of vehicles and missiles. 

So why the change of heart now? If we assume he's being sincere, I think he realizes he has no other off-ramp. He knows demilitarizing or defeating Ukraine will not happen. He knows Western aid to Ukraine will continue for *years* and his army is on the brink of collapse from the perspective of morale and logistics. It's either now or never. 

So in his mind, as long as he keeps the annexed territories, he can paint it as a Russian victory to his people. Claim he reclaimed the glorious Novorussiya (what they call eastern Ukraine and Crimea) for glorious mother Russia, the land they claim historically belongs to Russia.

Now of course, not everyone in Russia will view it as a victory, some Russian nationalists and Putinists define victory only as a surrendered and disarmed Ukraine or as a totally conquered Ukraine, but Putin will find a way to spin the meaning of victory through propaganda. 

Or alternatively just censor the voices that claim there was no victory. Either way, he'll have to present the image that there was a victory. We might literally see a Bush-style ""mission accomplished"" banner behind Putin at a parade or something at some point.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"Full Text:

The results of the 2024 election have confirmed a reality that is too frequently denied by Democratic Party leaders and strategists: The American working class is angry ‚Äî and for good reason.

They want to know why the very rich are getting much richer, and the CEOs of major corporations make almost 300 times more than their average employees, while weekly wages remain stagnant and 60 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.

They want to know why corporate profits soar while companies shut down factories in America and move to low-wage countries.

They want to know why the food industry enjoys record breaking profits, while they can‚Äôt afford their grocery bills.

They want to know why they can‚Äôt afford to go to a doctor or pay for their prescription drugs, and worry about going bankrupt if they end up in a hospital.

Donald Trump won this election because he tapped into that anger.

Did he address any of these serious issues in a thoughtful or meaningful way? Absolutely not.

What he did do was divert the festering anger in our country at a greedy and out-of-touch corporate elite into a politics that served his political goals and will end up further enriching his fellow billionaires.

Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúgenius‚Äù is his ability to divide the working class so that tens of millions of Americans will reject solidarity with their fellow workers and pave the way for huge tax breaks for the very rich and large corporations.

While Trump did talk about capping credit card interest rates at 10 percent, and a new trade policy with China, his fundamental explanation as to why the working class was struggling was that millions of illegal immigrants have invaded America and that we are now an ‚Äúoccupied country.‚Äù

In his pathologically dishonest world, undocumented immigrants are illegally participating in our elections and voting for Democrats. They are creating massive amounts of crime, driving wages down, and taking our jobs. They are getting free health care and other benefits that are denied to American citizens. They are even eating our pets.

That explanation is grossly racist, cruel, and fallacious. But it is an explanation.

And what do the Democrats have to say about the crises facing working families? What is their full-throated explanation, pounded away day after day in the media, in the halls of Congress, and in town meetings throughout the country as to why tens of millions of workers, in the richest country on earth, are struggling to put food on the table or pay the rent? Where is the deeply felt outrage that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care for all as a human right while insurance and drug companies make huge profits?

How do they explain supporting billions of dollars in military aid to the right-wing extremist government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which has created an unprecedented humanitarian disaster in Gaza that is causing massive malnutrition and starvation for thousands of children?

In my view, the Democrats lost this election because they ignored the justified anger of working class America and became the defenders of a rigged economic and political system.

This election was largely about class and change and the Democrats, in both cases, were often on the wrong side. As Jimmy Williams Jr., the president of the Painters Union, said, ‚ÄúThe Democratic Party has continued to fail to prioritize a strong, working-class message that addresses issues that really matter to workers. The party did not make a positive case for why workers should vote for them, only that they were not Donald Trump. That‚Äôs not good enough anymore!‚Äù

As an Independent member of the US Senate, I caucus with the Democrats. In that capacity I have been proud to work with President Biden on one of the most ambitious pro-worker agendas in modern history.

We passed the American Rescue Plan to pull us out of the COVID-19 economic downturn; made historic investments in rebuilding our infrastructure and in transforming our energy system; began the process of rebuilding our manufacturing base; lowered the cost of prescription drugs and forgave student debt for five million Americans. Biden promised to be the most progressive president since FDR and, on domestic issues, he kept his word.

But, unlike FDR, these achievements are almost never discussed within the context of a grossly unfair economy that continues to fail ordinary Americans. Yes. In the past few years we have made some positive changes. We must acknowledge, however, that what we‚Äôve done is nowhere near enough.

In 1936, in his second inaugural address, FDR spoke not only of his administration‚Äôs enormous achievements in combatting the Great Depression, but of the painful economic realities that millions of Americans were still experiencing.

Roosevelt‚Äôs words remain relevant today: ‚ÄúI see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hangs over them day by day ‚Ä¶ I see millions denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children ‚Ä¶ I see one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.‚Äù

Of course, the world is today profoundly different than it was in 1936. We are not in an economic depression. Unemployment is relatively low. People are not facing starvation.

But the Democratic leadership must recognize that, in a rapidly changing economy, working families face an enormous amount of economic pain, anxiety and hopelessness ‚Äî and they want change. The status quo is not working for them.

In politics you can‚Äôt fight something with nothing. The Democratic Party needs to determine which side it is on in the great economic struggle of our times, and it needs to provide a clear vision as to what it stands for. Either you stand with the powerful oligarchy of our country, or you stand with the working class. You can‚Äôt represent both.

While Democrats will be in the minority in the Senate and (probably) the House in the new Congress, they will still have the opportunity to bring forth a strong legislative agenda that addresses the needs of working families.

If Republicans choose to vote those bills down, the American working class will learn quickly enough as to which party represents them, and which party represents corporate greed.

In my view, here are some of the working class priorities that Democrats must fight for:",2024_11_11,17_08_15

On both ballot initiatives and polling on the issues, progressive policies are consistently popular. Raising the minimum wage, protecting abortion, paid sick leave, expansions to social security/medicare, etc. etc. etc. These policy positions *are* popular. The problem is twofold. 1) Democrats don't even run on these issues. They don't run on medicare for all, they don't run on raising the minimum wage. 2) the reason they don't, is because it doesn't slot into their pro-corporate, pro-status qou world view. This goes hand-in-hand with their lack of a narrative.

Why do so many people go from Bernie supporters to Trump voters? It is narrative. Bernie has his clear narrative. The Billionaire oligarchs are robbing Americans blind, so the economy needs to start working for ordinary Americans vis-a-vis universal healthcare and raising the minimum wage.

Strengthening unions, reducing inflation, increasing job security, increase consumer rights, giving pathways to home ownership for those that couldn't, improving jobs by bringing back high paying labor jobs, greening our infrastructure, etc., etc.,etc.

>When leftists protested against the genocide, Harris and the Dems told them to go fuck themselves.

The left constantly supports far right regimes, who frankly use child soldiers, and kill LGBT people. You can't be a lefties if you support the far right and fasists, like the government of Palestine. That's kind of my point. What the left protest is often in support of far right regimens. There's a big disconnect here between what the far left claims to support, and what they actually end up supporting.

>She ran an objectively shitty, centerist campaign that targeted white conservative women, refused assert trans rights, boasted about creating the most lethal military force in the world, and paraded around the country with the fucking Cheneys.

I've hear the left say we need to abandon trans rights more then I've heard it from the right. Hell there were multiple posts on self about this very topic. This is something else I can't stand about he far left, they lie to my face and try to gaslight me, like the far right does.

Harris tried to win conservative women over with abortions rights because data indicates they care deeply about that, your right on that, it didn't work. Even though it should have.

>The left doesn't come out to vote for the Democrats reliably at this point because the Democratic Party has repeatedly crushed leftist movement within its ranks and refused to run on progressive policy since Obama's first term. 

That's literally all they run on. I don't know how to get through to you, it's like you're surrounded by so much misinformation and outright lies, I don't know how to counter it. You're literally being puppet by the right and far right against leftest interest. If pointing at reality isn't enough for you to see that then I don't know what will.

We literally had someone championing and fighting for strengthening unions vs a candidate who whats to kill the department of labor. Leftest have collectively said destroying the department of labor is fine with them over electing a democrat. Ok, then you can't be on the left. That should be the core value the left has, and if they're willing to just abandon it, they aren't the left.

The only thing about minimum wage is that she supports raising it and getting rid of sub minimum wage for tipped workers. It does not commit to a specific number.

It does not mention Citizens United. 

It *does* support the PRO act, so that's a positive. 

It does not discuss pensions.

She endorses strengthening ACA, but not Medicare for All. It does not mention dental, vision, or hearing care.

She does support bringing down prescription drug costs, and that has been something the Biden administration has put effort into.

She does support family and medical leave.

She doesn't mention equal pay for equal work in those words, but does support equality acts, which include that, which I think is good.

She is committed to the three million housing target.

She says she is against unfair trade practices, which is probably close enough. It's light on details, though.

She mentions improving student loan debt relief, but not specifically reducing tuition or making tuition free for state institutions. 

She does support affordable childcare. She does not mention teachers at all.

She does support cutting taxes on the middle class and raising them on the wealthy. I think you can argue details, but the sentiment is close enough.

She does not mention the Pentagon. I agree with Sanders on this one, but that's long been a bugaboo of his, and I don't think it lacking in her campaign policies is that big an issue.

I would say, overall, there is a lot of overlap, but the lack of focus on some of those issues probably didn't help. Given how narrow the margins are overall, every little bit helps.

"A lot of people think that if the candidate perfectly appeals to them, said candidate will perfectly appeal to everyone else. 

This is just simply not true. The ideal candidate (if such a candidate exists) in the eyes of an extremely leftist person is not necessarily the ideal candidate for someone to the right of them. It may not be the ideal candidate to you or me. But pragmatically speaking, both you and I would support such a candidate because the alternative is objectively worse. 

To be able to have a candidate one fully, truly, supports wholeheartedly is a very privileged position, and odds are one would be very fortunate to vote for such a candidate for a national governmental position. Outside of that, every candidate is going to be a vote of compromise, weighing pros and cons, and recognizing that while a candidate is not going to be the perfect representative, is going to be a representative sufficient enough to then sway towards closer to perfect.

Unadulterated adoration to a specific politician is how we got Trump, because his voters and supporters have unadulterated adoration for him, at the expense of everything else. It is foolish to think one's belief in progressive or leftist policy and rhetoric means one is above showing unadulterated adoration to a specific politician.

If one believes that their vote is something to be _earned_, then they have in some ways missed the plot. Who a voter votes for (or withdraws from voting) is an exertion of that voters' individual agency. To say that one's vote must be earned is removing one's agency in the matter, to say that one is merely a checklist of things to tick off to secure a +1 on a counter. 

The default position in elections should not be, can I be bothered to vote, and always who should I vote for. Not voting is never an option -- it's just that unlike many other places in the world, the US simply can't compel a voter to vote. Citizens in the US have the privilege to not participate in a critical civic responsibility, and exerting that privilege is toxic.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Im a small business owner and do manufacturing here in the US. The raw materials I need for my production originate in China and are imported by US based companies. They are the ones that will have to pay the tariffs thus raising the cost of these materials.

That costs goes up x1.4 throughout the distribution channel. A 100% tariff would increase my current costs by nearly 250%. What I currently sell to you for $50 I‚Äôll now have to charge min $90.

I‚Äôd probably go out of business as my customers will opt for a much cheaper and lesser quality version of what I make from someone else. Or I change my quality standards and just sell the shittest piece of garbage just to keep my price down. So guys like me who pride ourselves on quality synonymous with ‚ÄúMade In The USA‚Äù, will now be a race to the bottom. Most companies will go under, some will get bought out (ie walmart gobbling up mom and pop stores).  Reducing product quality across the industry. 

Also‚Ä¶the last time the US applied sweeping tariffs on all imports, foreign countries retaliated with their own tariffs on all US goods thus shutting down global trade, collapsing the economy, sending us into the Great Depression.

Economies around the world tumbled and unemployment and inflation utterly skyrocketed. In Germany unemployment rose from 4% to 30% in 4 years and inflation hit 320%.

This gave rise to a little known politician who rose to popularity claiming only he can bring Germany back to its former glory. His message resonated and he was elected into office then declared anyone he didn‚Äôt like un-patriotic and had them rounded up and executed. Then once he had absolute power and loyalty he tried to take over ALL OF EUROPE.

So tariffs on all imported products will have devastating consequences for the entire world and everyone Trump will surround himself with won‚Äôt know any better to say no to him.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"As someone who has done international business manufacturing for 10 years, how can tariffs tank the economy?

The tariffs are not a standalone proposal, as it was proposed federal income tax would be eliminated, which would stimulate the economy and offset the increased price of goods from tariffs. 
Many countries I deal with have VAT, so if I continue to manufacturer outside the US, the price to the consumer would increase slightly, such as by 20%‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôve seen that already since COVID, and by much higher numbers, due to sourcing limitations, reduced workforce, etc. 
If companies are incentivized by a tariff implemented, to move manufacturing to domestic, then more American jobs will be available, increasing domestic availability as well as GDP, putting revenue in the hands of Americans.

This will ultimately greatly lower manufacturing costs while increasing workforce and spending by consumers, which will strengthen the economy.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"The idea with tariffs is to incentivize domestic production of goods over importing them, ideally making it so that the American economy isn't so reliant on other countries for manufacturing, and hopefully, there will be an increase in manufacturing jobs for Americans.

The fundamental problem here is that the exact reason we import goods from China to begin with is because doing that is _much_ cheaper than trying to handle all production domestically. Also, the U.S. doesn't have anywhere _near_ enough factories built up yet to sustain production on the scale that China can. You also need to factor in that many Chinese workers have _decades_ of manufacturing experience while Americans would need to be trained from the ground up to take on these roles, and that's going to come with a large learning curve and growing pains. 

In other words, it's not like we'll be able to wave a magic wand and instantly switch to domestic production on the fly; it will require YEARS and millions, if not _billions_ of taxpayer dollars for us to have something even remotely sustainable and even then there's no guarantee we'll be able to match China's output or get our prices cheap enough to make it worth it. It's also inevitable in such a scenario that many companies/industries will go belly up in the process, due to losing money trying to get everything sorted out.


On top of that, you also have to factor in the fact that the U.S. and China have different sets of regulations and that alone could turn into a logistical nightmare; plenty of goods just flatout cannot be produced here in the states the same way they are in China.


Taking all of that into consideration, companies are _far_ more likely to pass down the increased cost from tariffs onto the consumer (while also using them as a smokescreen to further price gouge) instead of changing up their entire business model. That's why most economists are predicting the price of goods will rise by up to 40% with Trump's proposed tariffs.",2024_11_11,17_08_15
"Let‚Äôs look at the pro of a tariff:

Johnson created a 25% tariff on trucks and SUV‚Äôs coming from Europe,  it was a bit of a temper tantrum after European imposed a tariff on chickens coming from America.

This meant that American importers of European vehicles had to pay 25% more, and that charge was passed on the the consumer, otherwise the importer would just go out of business; it was about $5000 per vehicle.

Mercedes Benz decided it didn‚Äôt want to lose such a lucrative market, so they built production plants in America, thus bypassing the ‚Äúimport‚Äù tariff.  It was not a bad move after all; it created US jobs.

But the bad part about tariffs are small American companies that make their products *mostly* in American, but import mat√©riels for production.  One company that is worrying about the tariffs trump has suggested is Steve Madden, the shoe people.  They make a popular mid priced shoe, but they do import parts from China.  They can‚Äôt afford to pay more to make the shoes and still make a decent profit.  They feel compelled to pass on the extra cost to the consumers, and they worry that they will lose popularity if they price out of their usual niche market.  They feel pinched, as will the consumers of their products.

The tariff is like a duty on products from foreign countries.  The country passes this extra tax or duty onto the American importers.  How the importers deal with it makes it positive or negative.  When SVU importers just stopped carrying foreign vehicles, the companies decided to build here, and it was good.  But what often happens is the importer does not have the luxury of finding an affordable alternative, and they pay the tariff and then pass on the cost to us, the consumers.

>Citigroup analysts have also used the word plutonomy to describe economies ""where economic growth is powered by and largely consumed by the wealthy few."" In three reports for super-rich Citigroup clients published in 2005 and 2006, a team of Citigroup analysts elaborated on their thesis that the share of the very rich in national income of plutonomies had become so large that what is going on in these economies and in their relation with other economies cannot be properly understood any more with reference to the average consumer: ""The rich are so rich that their behavior ‚Äì be it negative savings, or just very low consumption of oil as a % of their income ‚Äì overwhelms that of the 'average' consumer."" The authors of these studies predicted that the global trend toward plutonomies would continue, for various reasons, including ""capitalist-friendly governments and tax regimes"". They do, however, also warn of the risk that, since ""political enfranchisement remains as was ‚Äì one person, one vote, at some point it is likely that labor will fight back against the rising profit share of the rich and there will be a political backlash against the rising wealth of the rich.""",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Trump usually just talks nonsense (build a wall, make Mexico pay) but as people have mentioned he‚Äôs serious on tariffs, but no one else is. And unlike the wall, fucking it up will have big implications for their voting base. Which makes me think congress and cabinet will try to talk him down to something far less drastic.

">The folk theory of democracy is grounded in the Enlightenment tradition of rational choice: voters seek information, weigh the available evidence and then choose the government with the strongest policies to deliver on their pledges.¬†


>According to the authors, this ideal bears little resemblance to how democracy actually works. In fact, the ‚Äòomnicompetent, sovereign citizen‚Äô found in the influential writings of Robert Dahl and Walt Whitman is an unattainable myth: voters are incapable and uninterested in fulfilling the role required of them by democracy. Most people are too busy with jobs and families to give politics sufficient attention: rather than spending their leisure time studying the minutiae of trade deals or infrastructure planning, they, quite understandably, pursue more enjoyable pastimes.¬†


>Even the minority of voters that have the time and inclination to inform themselves about politics do not behave as folk theory contends. When faced with choice in a democracy, human judgement is overwhelmed by the complexity of the world and bent by self-interest. Voters use information not to challenge their own opinions but to rationalise them, which the authors describe as ‚Äòenhanced bias‚Äô. To minimise cognitive dissonance ‚Äì when an individual holds inconsistent opinions or beliefs ‚Äì voters adjust their views to those of their favoured party, or simply avoid finding out what a party‚Äôs position is altogether if it conflicts with their own.¬†

Donald Trump hasn‚Äôt even taken office, and Congress is already moving to advance legislation to expand his ability to target his enemies. The former president has repeatedly threatened on the campaign trail that he will attack ‚Äúthe enemy from within‚Äù using the military. But new legislation could give him unprecedented authority to go after nonprofit organizations he disagrees with.

The House is set to vote this week on a bill that would grant the Treasury Department authority to revoke tax-exempt status from any nonprofit it declares to be a ‚Äúterrorist supporting organization,‚Äù giving the agency broad latitude to determine what that means.

"Yup, same. I use this information to keep friends and family properly informed, at a high level, that is digestible, when they need to know. And. most importantly, to keep them from falling for the lies and half-truths that they constantly see every day everywhere.

When they are worried a higher minimum wage will raise costs, I remind them costs have already been increasing and the pay for top CEOs is going up right now. And minimum wage income instantly goes back into keeping the economy running, which CEO level bonuses sits in savings accounts, or makes even more money in the stock market accounts, but not the economy.

When they repeat that high cost of Medicare for All, I remind them that the current system costs more than that currently, so it would actually save money, while covering more people.

When they bring up close the USPS because of the cost and slowdowns at the post office, I boil it down to that under Bush, all new USPS jobs need to have the pension fully funded up front, that Trump installed DeJoy, who has some financial interest in other shipping companies, and destroyed mail sorting machines before the 2020 election, and that I'm disappointed Obama nor Biden reversed these actions.

I don't tell them any rumors, like that a few people are saying there are some weird voting number patterns, that a recount in just a few counties, would easily end any questions. But I can answer any questions if they come up.

Since 1962 (Robinson v. California), the Supreme Court has held that the 8th amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment prohibits laws criminalizing who you are rather than what you did (the case dealt with a law making it a crime to be a drug addict).

The 9th Circuit extended that concept in 2018 (Martin v. City of Boise) barring criminalizing sitting outside and sleeping outside when they do not have access to shelter, so western states for the last several years were required to provide shelter first before criminalizing the homeless population for sleeping in public.

This year, in City of Grants Pass, Oregon v. Johnson the 9th Circuit's ruling in Martin is effectively vacated and criminalizing sleeping outside is again possible.

It's a little costly up front but otherwise seems like a win-win where only people that no one cares about lose! /s

I'm no American so I have no say in it, but the fact that Gaza most likely will be razed properly this time with no coming back in any way, shape or form is at least partially the fault of those who chose Trump over Harris.

"If that's the level you're discussing the topic then I'm not surprised by the outcome. 

""Relative peace in the region"" whilst not addressing any of the underlying issues that continuously make the violence flare up, a President that is best buddy's with Netanjahu who showed his gratitude with the ""Trump Heights"" in the occupied Golan heights, who enacted the infamous Muslim travel ban, called most of the Middle East a shit hole, fantasized about the ""Gaza Beach property"", whose son in law and advisor encouraged Israel to ""not let the Palestinians back whilst they're rebuilding it"" and who personally encouraged Netanjahu to ""finish the job"" just a few months ago, yeah that administration. 

""It's not that hard"" as a consideration of whom to vote for only works if you're completely daft by nature or by purpose. 
It is complicated, that's the whole fucking point of the situation in the Middle East.

"I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree for a couple reasons. Democrats have to put a white man forward again. My guesses: Andy Beshear, Newsom, and Buttigieg. 

Newsom has a charm about him that could work. He has that future silver fox appeal, still handsome without the grays for white women. Certain white men will trust him. Funny and cutthroat during debates. Even guys like Nick Fuentes fawning over him. So if he can do all that could be solid. BUT even with that he‚Äôs not as relatable to middle America even tho they voted for a richer man AND his track record in Cali is very questionable. 

Which is why i kinda prefer Andy Beshear. It has to be options to see who‚Äôs the best. Personally, Beshear has that relatability that can connect with Mid America and south. Newsom connects with the coast/major city states. But I won‚Äôt be surprised if they both share a ticket in 2028",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"Sorry, this is long. 

Ranked Choice allows voters to put their vote behind a candidate they want without wasting their vote. 

For example, if a party for the unionization of workers turned up, and the candidate basically just ran on a ticket of protecting workers rights, any union worker could toss their vote that way first and not worry about their vote getting wasted because they split the vote. 

Think of it this way, let's say there are 5 groups of single issue voters in the Democrat wheelhouse

You have the Human Rights crowd, the Climate crowd, the Labor crowd, the Welfare crowd, and the Status Quo crowd (DNC style democrats) 

Let's say Human Rights gets 12% of the vote, Climate wins heavily among young voters, getting 25%, Labor is HUGE and gets 30%, Welfare doesn't pull punches and gets 25%, and then the Status Quo gets 8%, presumably being 12 old people and a bunch of voters who are fired up enough to vote in a primary but NOT enough to learn about what any candidate stands for unless they are endorsed by a Clinton (8% might be a little low...)

Anyways, ranked choice matters a lot here, because the way it works is, you eliminate the smallest group. So, let's say you eliminate the 8% status quo, and these voters skew older so they probably aren't worried about climate change, and also are retired so they don't care about labor. They care about human rights a little, so that goes from 12% to 14%, but they LOVE welfare. That's their check. Goes from 25 to 31%. 

Well, welfare just went from tied for 3rd, to 1st place. 

Next, eliminate human rights (Fitting for America, eh?) 

These people skew young. Labor rights middling for them, because a lot of them haven't worked for a union before. 3% swings labor, putting them back on top with 33%! But, here's the big upset, they DON'T vote Welfare, because they are convinced that SSI will dry up in the next 5 years, and instead dump EVERYTHING into Climate. This goes 11 points into Climate, which SKYROCKETS into first place, getting to 36% of the primary vote. 

Well, now Welfare is back on bottom, so they get eliminated. When the SSI dries up, they are going to need jobs, so might as well dump your vote into Labor. The group swings 21 points into Labor, pushing them up to 54%. 

And, because this is a primary, that means that Climate concedes to run for president, and endorses the Labor candidate as the next president of the United States. 

Do you see why this is valuable? You don't have to always vote status quo. MAGA showed that Americans aren't interested in the old guard of politics. Notice how vanguard Democrats don't become pseudo-celebrities, unlike progressives like Bernie or AOC",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"I mean, I appreciate he thinks our checks and balances will hold. I hope he‚Äôs right.  Democrats need to do a serious autopsy of the 2024 election. But who is the coroner and will the Democratic Party unite instead of pointing fingers at each other?  

The election pendulum swings hard. Every election cycle, people want change because the real issue of massive inequality, a living wage, and affordability for housing and basic necessities, has not been addressed by either political party for decades. Biden has passed policies to address the housing shortage and economy, but it will be years before we see the results of the Inflation Reduction Act, CHIPS, infrastructure law, and housing starts underway.

For those of us who follow the news, we know how bad Trump is. But it‚Äôs shocking how many Americans either don‚Äôt pay attention, or don‚Äôt care, about what we think are very important issues, democracy, abortion, Trump‚Äôs criminal behavior. They want someone to tell them, in a very simple digestible message, that their personal economic situation will improve. And Trump did just that, fear that and I will fix it.

Americans, exhausted by the daily challenges of making ends meet, don‚Äôt want to see a detailed plan. They don‚Äôt want to hear the psychology behind why Trump is a danger or hear the history of why democracy is on the line. They want to know when they can afford housing.  That‚Äôs it.

Democrats need to hone in on their economics messaging, meet with and listen to working class Americans, and unite with one voice. Conservative far right media, Fox News, Newsmax, One America News Network, the Sinclair network of radio and TV stations and newspapers, iHeart Media, the Bott Radio Network (Christian radio), Elon Musk‚Äôs X, and huge podcasts like Joe Rogan‚Äôs, definitely have set the news agenda in this country. They speak with one voice and that voice tells their followers Trump is the answer to all of their problems. And Americans believed it.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Harassing girls and women outside of Planned Parenthood, trans people who have the audacity to exist in public, and so on.

¬†I was talking about this to a friend, a black man who teaches philosophy at a nearby university, and has a doctorate in political science from UC Berkeley.¬†¬†

"You know what? Stop acting like a fucking pussy. You, as well as all these others commenting similar shit on here for the past few days acting like we‚Äôve all lost already. It‚Äôs cowardly and pathetic.

First off, no the hell we haven‚Äôt. Plain and simple. Trump isn‚Äôt in office yet, and he hasn‚Äôt put his shitty plans into action, and more importantly, we are all still here.

Secondly, we haven‚Äôt even really TRIED fighting back. We just vote, sign petitions for things we want to see change, maybe even protested here and there, but we‚Äôve never done anything to actually make the far right fascists genuinely afraid to do their fascist shit, and never want to try again. 

You know how humanity did that last time? Ask the French, and ask those that fought against Hitler. History has proven that it‚Äôs possible to fight and defeat fascism, but we‚Äôre not gonna beat them by playing their games by their own rules. We‚Äôve been handling them with bureaucratic, pacifist gloves, and that needs to change, now.

And third: What the hell gives you the right to give up when you haven‚Äôt even truly given it your all? And that goes for a lot of us, even me. 

I don‚Äôt know how involved you‚Äôve been in political activism over the years, and I‚Äôm sure even the slightest amount of involvement you‚Äôve had in it would greatly outweigh mine considering I‚Äôve never seriously taken part in any of it past simply voting for things and people I believe in, but even putting that out there, I am still gonna wager that it probably hasn‚Äôt been all that much, considering you and others like you, even me once again, are all still here, bitching about the end, acting like the worst has already come when it really hasn‚Äôt yet.

That, and the fascists don‚Äôt feel afraid of us yet, or think we‚Äôre not a threat. There nothing more than nationwide bullies, and we need to prove them very wrong. You don‚Äôt protect your loved ones from bullies by telling on the bullies to a teacher, speaking from experience that never works. You protect them by sending a clear message to the bully that fucking with you or them is a bad idea.

We all need to fight this harder than we ever have before. And if anyone‚Äôs still subscribed to the philosophy of ‚Äúthey go low, we go high‚Äù, no fucking more of that. We‚Äôve been pulling our punches against the elite, and the alt-right, because we‚Äôre afraid of what we stand to lose when we do. But what a lot of us probably don‚Äôt yet realize, is that if we roll over now, and not even give these fuckers a proper fight, we WILL lose everything anyway. So might as well fight with all we have, with whatever we have before we can‚Äôt anymore, because the way we‚Äôve been doing shit up until now hasn‚Äôt worked.

No more giving in, giving up, and definitely no more doomer bullshit, as that helps no one. Organize, plan, prep, and find ways to fight this.

"Yeah this isn't remotely similar, far worse in every way. I've seen a lot, born in the 70s, and this is likely America deciding to end the American experiment and fracture into something else. It's unprecedented in recent history. You have to remember that GWB did have a sense of ethics and restraint and Trump simply does not. I'm not saying GWB is a good guy because he isn't, but he did, at least, respect norms and traditions to some extent, while again, Trump does not. Trump does not at all respect rule of law, nor, apparently do the people who voted for him. GWB blundered around and had bad people making bad decisions for other parts of the world, while Trump is simply a malevolent presence who wants to turn force against America itself.

This situation is essentially the result of a long running cold war between the US and Russia ending in Russian victory. Many of the bullshit social media movements have been related to it. Americans took the bait and we're in uncharted territory.

"We were depressed, knew we had to deal with 4 more years of the same and just wait it out.  Then three years later Obama ran and slowly started having traction.  His campaign was organic; his campaign organized 2k rallies inside a university auditorium instead the tickets were oversubscribed so they had to switch to hosting 10k people in the park.  The primaries were a nasty fight down to the district level, the DNC did not support him (it was supposed to be Hillary for the first time), everyone was skeptical he could actually win.  After he won, there was a massive yell of relief the moment he got sworn in.  However, Shrub (Bush Jr) and Cheney were not as threatening as Trump and his cabal.  Today is different in feeling, way more sinister.   

Lesson learned - resistance has to coalesce around a person (it‚Äôs too early right now), the DNC has to be ruthless towards the Republicans not internally, for a candidate to make it through the state nominating process, it needs to be organized to the precinct level.  My precinct voted for Obama and most Obama people didn‚Äôt show up to the district nominating convention a month later; the Clinton people played dirty tricks and nominated two of their people to go to the state convention to vote for the state‚Äôs nominee; the at-large delegate positions went to people who were connected to the local county Democratic Party.

The two closest comparisons to dropping out this late before an election were President Truman before the 1952 election and President Lyndon B. Johnson before the 1968 election. There‚Äôs a lot of what ifs.  

I think most people are empathetic to people‚Äôs economic struggles.  Unfortunately, most Trump supporters, excited about a Trump presidency, are not in the right tax bracket to be excited. Under Trump‚Äôs tariff and tax policies, taxes will go up for low- and middle-income Americans. The top 5% of Americans will get a tax cut accelerating inequality. The cost of housing will not go down. After decades of under building, it will take years for Biden‚Äôs housing plan to have an impact. The cost of food will not go down. Only a few corporations own our food supply and climate change is impacting the cost of food. This is a systemic problem that would take political will by
both parties to fix.  

Most Americans have what I call 10 Second Tom Syndrome. They don‚Äôt remember the chaos of the last Trump administration. They also want immediate results, understandably, because they see the cards are stacked against them. Hence, why they latched onto Trump‚Äôs message that he‚Äôll fix it.

20 Lessons from the 20th Century

Author: Timothy Snyder

  


Americans are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism, or communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. Here are twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the circumstances of today.

  


20 Lessons from the 20th Century

  


1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. You‚Äôve already done this, haven‚Äôt you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.

  


2. Defend an institution. Follow the courts or the media, or a court or a newspaper. Do not speak of ‚Äúour institutions‚Äù unless you are making them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions don‚Äôt protect themselves. They go down like dominoes unless each is defended from the beginning.

  


3. Recall professional ethics. When the leaders of state set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become much more important. It is hard to break a rule-of-law state without lawyers, and it is hard to have show trials without judges.

  


4. When listening to politicians, distinguish certain words. Look out for the expansive use of ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù and ‚Äúextremism.‚Äù Be alive to the fatal notions of ‚Äúexception‚Äù and ‚Äúemergency.‚Äù Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.

  


5. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Don‚Äôt fall for it.

  


6. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. (Don‚Äôt use the internet before bed. Charge your gadgets away from your bedroom, and read.) What to read? Perhaps ‚ÄúThe Power of the Powerless‚Äù by V√°clav Havel, 1984 by George Orwell, The Captive Mind by Czes≈Çaw Milosz, The Rebel by Albert Camus, The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, or Nothing is True and Everything is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev.

  


7. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy, in words and deeds, to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. And the moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.

  


8. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.

  


9. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes.

  


10. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.

  


11. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.

  


12. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.

  


13. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can.

  


14. Give regularly to good causes, if you can. Pick a charity and set up autopay. Then you will know that you have made a free choice that is supporting civil society helping others doing something good.

  


15. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state, looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many hooks.

  


16. Learn from others in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties here are an element of a general trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.

  


17. Watch out for the paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-Leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the game is over.

  


18. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional ethics.)

  


19. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die in unfreedom.

  


20. Be a patriot. The incoming president is not. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.

It didn‚Äôt matter that the economy is doing well when all of the voters don‚Äôt understand what we‚Äôve been up against in fixing things post-COVID. Our messaging was awful. Putting out endorsements from Dick and Liz Cheney didn‚Äôt help. We don‚Äôt have nearly the control of the media that the right does, and part of it is the establishment democrats that can‚Äôt learn we‚Äôre in a new world with new rules and we gotta offer bigger bolder solutions.

Part of it is trying to appraise a bunch of Republican never-trumpers that have dragged the democrats to the right.¬†",2024_11_11,17_08_15
"No it was 100% the DNC deciding that they were gonna try to fellate centrist Republicans as a strategy to gain votes rather than offering a true change. Their status quo bullshit lost them the election. People wanted a change from getting fucked in the ass by the billionaire class and the best the DNC could do was fail at enforcing the law when they broke it.¬†


Fuck the neo-lib DNC. This is what you get when you let them run the show.",2024_11_11,17_08_15
"The fact that Dick Cheney, the fuckin' Lord of Darkness himself, backed Harris should tell you all you need to know. The things they did in the name of the War on Terror almost seem quaint now.

"Agree, this nihilism is not the antidote.  Help other people.  Do you really want everything to burn?  Apathy and nihilism are the worst enemy.  You wouldn‚Äôt save someone from a burning house?  The consequence for everyone is death.  Let us try to make it better for others in the meantime.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

When exactly does the ‚Äúintrospection‚Äù end and ‚Äúresistance‚Äù begin?   This has been a predictable path since the Trickle Down economic policies of the early 1980s.  45 years later we‚Äôre at the end stages of Capitalism and these little ineffectual videos on a network that doesn‚Äôt even come close to the fan base of a single conservative podcast is the best that can be done?,2024_11_11,17_08_15

"They have a messaging problem AND a policy problem.

Those policies would help people, yes, but they are just nipping at the edges of fundamental economic issues that keep getting worse. Why are Democrats so afraid of going big? They shouldn't be talking about small expansions of Medicare; they should be talking about healthcare as a human right. They should be talking about fixing the problems that are making housing expensive, not just giving people incentives to buy into existing problems. They should be talking about a free college option, not just trying to forgive student loans, which fixes nothing long-term. 

Democratic positions are weak. And they'll keep being seen as weak unless they seriously fight for progress.",2024_11_11,17_08_15
"People who just voted for subjugation and disenfranchisement sanctimoniously lecturing us on ""what we need to do to win their votes""...

It doesn't matter anymore.  Democrats doing some elaborate song and dance to coax the gun out of your hand and away from your foot isn't on the table anymore.

Calling for construction of new homes and preventing investing companies from buying up all the properties meant to be single family homes, something Republicans have also pushed for (they hate Blackrock especially) 

And expanding Medicare to elderly (something trump had stated he wanted prior to kamala)

They‚Äôre civil servants, so serve the public instead of asking the public to serve the country. People sold their morals for a promise of a few bucks instead, and that has me disillusioned. Kinda wanna just worry about my kids and let everyone who voted for this get what they voted for. Maybe things need to get worse before they get better, or maybe this is just the beginning of a slippery slope.

"Both sides of this can exist. Yes, if you save early and aggressively, there‚Äôs a good retirement for you. On the other side, it‚Äôs not easy for most people (especially younger millennials and gen z), with wages being relatively stagnant and a lack of financial security (dot com, housing bubble, COVID crashes; student loans, rent/interest rates, inflation). 

My cynical take is that despite perfect planning, there‚Äôs no guarantee of a successful future. The chances of a retirement account looking amazing 30-40 years from now is no exception. My napkin mathing thinks the decline in birth rates (or interest in raising families) and lack of financial stability is going to be a problem for Wall Street when boomers start liquidating at higher rates than others are buying.

">The Warren court wasn't stacked with lifetime-appointed far-right activist Judges

The Supreme Court of the late 1800s/early 1900s was incredibly conservative. They enshrined racial segregation in federal law. They upheld racially discriminatory immigration laws. They undermined labor and permitted the arrest of Americans for speaking out against war.

>Say what you will about the presidents of the civil rights era, but none of them were mask-off fascists who pledged to end democracy and free speech, sold US secrets to foreign adversaries, and openly called for violence against their political rivals.

Most of the presidents of the Jim Crow era were openly white supremacists. Several of them deployed the military against their own citizens in labor disputes. They actively arrested socialists and union organizers, and sought to suppress their speech. They supported the disenfrachisement of women and non-whites. They restricted non-white immigration. They were bought out by billionaires. They falsely accused civil rights activists of being communists and used false pretenses to arrest/kill them.

You can wallow in your misery if you want. Just know that you are among the most privileged, wealthy, and free humans to ever live. It's your choice to fold the first time you face a shred of actual difficulty.

But how tone deaf would it be to just throw my hands up and say ""I feel like things have been bad for me already so now there's just no use of trying for better""... when other people did not give up through enslavement, oppression, and the tendrils of those acts which still affect their lives?

">activism is about to become more dangerous

For most of our history, activism *has been dangerous.* Activists have faced police dogs, fire hoses, and Pinkerton hired guns. They were arrested, beaten, went on hunger strikes, and yes sometimes were killed. They were always in the minority, always stood up to political power and force, and never did their work with the promise of seeing any progress in their own lifetimes. And yet they kept fighting.

Do I *want* to do any of that? Absolutely not. Will I do that if the situation requires it? Absolutely.

Anything less dishonors the sacrifices of those who fought to build the way of life we inherited. Because they faced those dangers, we are where we are. And it's worth defending.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/mass-deportation  

* About 11 million undocumented immigrants lived in the United States as of 2022‚Äî3.3 percent of the country‚Äôs overall population. An additional 2.3 million removable immigrants were released into the United States between January 2023 and April 2024 and would also be targeted in any mass deportation operation.
* A one-time operation to deport these immigrants would cost at least $315 billion, broken down as follows:
    * The government would have to spend $89.3 billion to conduct sufficient arrests.
    * The government would have to spend $167.8 billion to detain immigrants en masse.
    * The government would have to spend $34.1 billion on legal processing.
    * The government would have to spend $24.1 billion on removals.
* Deporting one million immigrants per year would incur an annual cost of $88 billion, with the majority of that cost going towards building detention camps. It would take over ten years,  and the building of hundreds to thousands of new detention facilities, to arrest, detain, process, and remove all 13.3 million targeted immigrants‚Äîeven assuming that 20 percent of that population would depart voluntarily during any multi-year mass deportation effort. The total cost over 10.6 years (assuming an annual inflation rate of 2.5 percent) would be $967.9 billion. The annual costs would break down as follows:
    * The government would have to spend an average of $7 billion per year to conduct one million arrests annually.
    * The government would have to spend an average of $66 billion per year to detain one million immigrants annually, or surveil them on alternatives to detention programs while detention capacity ramps up to one million.
    * The government would have to spend an average of $12.6 billion per year to carry out legal processing for an average of one million immigrants annually.
    * The government would have to spend an average of $2.1 billion per year to remove one million immigrants annually.
* To carry out over 13 million arrests in a short period of time would require somewhere between 220,000 and 409,000 new government employees and law enforcement officers, which would be nearly impossible given current hiring challenges across law enforcement agencies. Even carrying out one million at-large arrests per year would require ICE to hire over 30,000 new law enforcement agents and staff, instantly making it the largest law enforcement agency in the federal government.
* Mass deportation would exacerbate the U.S. labor shortage. In 2022, nearly 90 percent of undocumented immigrants were of working age, compared to 61.3 percent of the U.S.-born population aged between 16 and 64, making undocumented immigrants more likely to actively participate in the labor force. Losing these working-age undocumented immigrants would worsen the severe workforce challenges that many industries have already been struggling with in the past few years.
* Mass deportation would hurt several key U.S. industries that rely heavily on undocumented workers. The construction and agriculture industries would lose at least one in eight workers, while in hospitality, about one in 14 workers would be deported due to their undocumented status. Among those industries, certain trades would be hit even harder. Mass deportation would remove more than 30 percent of the workers in major construction trades, such as plasterers, roofers, and painters; nearly 28 percent of graders and sorters of agriculture products; and a fourth of all housekeeping cleaners.
* Among the deported would be 1 million undocumented immigrant entrepreneurs, who generated $27.1 billion in total business income in 2022. Losing the 157,800 undocumented immigrant entrepreneurs in neighborhood businesses would lead to disruptions to services that have become an integral part of community life and provide local jobs for Americans.**
* The U.S. would lose out on key contributions undocumented households make to social safety net programs annually, including $22.6 billion to Social Security and $5.7 billion to Medicare. As the U.S. population ages, the loss of these payments would make it increasingly challenging to keep social safety net programs solvent.**
* Mass deportation would deprive federal, state, and local governments of billions in local tax contributions from undocumented households. In 2022 alone, undocumented immigrant households paid $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes. After taxes, they were left with $256.8 billion in spending power, money that could be spent in local communities.**
* Deporting undocumented immigrants would separate 4 million mixed-status families, affecting 8.5 million U.S. citizens with undocumented family members (5.1 million of whom are U.S. citizen children). It would slash the income of their households by an average of 62.7 percent ($51,200 per year).
* Overall, mass deportation would lead to a loss of 4.2 percent to 6.8 percent of annual U.S. GDP, or $1.1 trillion to $1.7 trillion in 2022 dollars. In comparison, the U.S. GDP shrunk by 4.3 percent during the Great Recession between 2007 and 2009.**
* The negative impact would be the most significant in California, Texas, and Florida, the three states that were home to 47.2 percent of the country's undocumented immigrants in 2022 and where one in every 20 residents would be deported.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

The rich do not want mass deportations. What happened when DeSantis enforced  e verification? People just stopped working.

Why haven't they stopped employers from hiring undocumented immigrants. Simply because they don't want to.

The rich benefit from undocumented labor. They obviously won't let republicans deport their money away.

Also people who think prisoners are going to be forced to work. I know Trump wouldn't love to do that. But not only would the logistics be impossible. One million prisoners can't do the work of 11 million plus undocumented immigrants.

"The legitimate debate is between bad, worse and apocalyptic. CO2 in the atmosphere is currently around 420 ppm up from 280 ppm pre-industrial while methane (a more potent greenhouse gas) has increased by two and a half times over pre-industrial levels. We continue to add CO2 and methane to the atmosphere at the rate of 2 ppm for CO2 and 14 ppb for methane. The much touted 'net-zero' will only balance the CO2 and methane produced with removal but won't have any impact on what has been produced prior to net-zero. 

The arctic ice is melting (decreasing albedo and absorbing more heat), permafrost is melting (releasing methane), the ocean is warming and acidifying from saturation with CO2 (reducing its ability to absorb CO2). Natural CO2 sinks are transforming into CO2 producers due to deforestation. There are no existing practical methods for mitigating these changes with geo-engineering. Any practical geo-engineering would require global mobilization unprecedented even in wartime.

All of this is a global chemistry experiment that has never been done before and can't be readily undone once it passes a certain (as yet) undefined point.

And if a brain drain that tanks the economy is what it takes to get American politicians to get off their asses, well, voting with your feet is a kind of voting.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"‚ÄúCentral government‚Äù wasn‚Äôt at all what the confederates were fighting against. In fact, the modern neo-confederate take about ‚Äústates rights‚Äù is entirely anachronistic. This isn‚Äôt even an area up for interpretation, as the Confederate states laid out their arguments quite extensively in their several Articles of Secession.

Texas for instance explicitly wrote that they were fighting to preserve white supremacy. This isn‚Äôt an interpretation, I‚Äôm not reading between any lines. They wrote:

> She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery‚Äîthe servitude of the African to the white race within her limits‚Äîa relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time.

> The controlling majority of the Federal Government, under various pretences and disguises, has so administered the same as to exclude the citizens of the Southern States, unless under odious and unconstitutional restrictions, from all the immense territory owned in common by all the States on the Pacific Ocean, for the avowed purpose of acquiring sufficient power in the common government to use it as a means of destroying the institutions of Texas and her sister slave-holding States.

And interestingly enough, the latter half of Texas‚Äô article is a huge complaint against northern states‚Äô own invocations of ‚Äústates rights‚Äù - specially, that northern states have used ‚Äústates rights‚Äù arguments to nullify the Fugitive Slave Acts and refused to enforce them.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"The problem with the United States right now is that most people don't understand what ""the West"" actually means.  The United States and Europe changed the norms of how countries interact in the world.  They generally saw regions as trade partners instead of competitors.  The game was played with a general set of rules.  The United States as the superpower regulated the West and protected it's interests, and as a result profited the most.  Europe got peace and a great deal of unity, something that was always a trouble spot until after WWII.

Russia has hated the rules of the West.  They built themselves up as a meat grinder, just throwing bodies to conquer lands.  Rights were generally whatever the government said they were.  They've had the same mindset stuck in the 1800s.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"[Indeed](https://www.ft.com/content/f4dbc0df-ab0d-431e-9886-44acd4236922):

Classical liberalism is a doctrine built around respect for the equal dignity of individuals through a rule of law that protects their rights, and through constitutional checks on the state‚Äôs ability to interfere with those rights. But over the past half century that basic impulse underwent two great distortions. The first was the rise of ‚Äúneoliberalism‚Äù, an economic doctrine that sanctified markets and reduced the ability of governments to protect those hurt by economic change. The world got a lot richer in the aggregate, while the working class lost jobs and opportunity. Power shifted away from the places that hosted the original industrial revolution to Asia and other parts of the developing world.

The second distortion was the rise of identity politics or what one might call ‚Äúwoke liberalism‚Äù, in which progressive concern for the working class was replaced by targeted protections for a narrower set of marginalised groups: racial minorities, immigrants, sexual minorities and the like. State power was increasingly used not in the service of impartial justice, but rather to promote specific social outcomes for these groups.""",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"No, but for all the talk about a 'new world order' that a lot of MAGA fans do, I don't think they realize that we are now embarking on a new world order regardless of how they feel, this one doesn't entail the US being the king of the castle either. It's the natural result of the isolationist policies, trade wars, tariffs, and contradictory policy regarding energy (watch China now completely blow past us in renewables and lead the world in that direction while we fall behind and cling to more expensive, dirty, fossil fuel) that Trump is proposing and promising. And Russia and China are likely cheering it along, especially considering how much ground the latter gained in the South China sea during his last presidency.

Trump is very anti-NATO, Trump plans to gut competent people from the government. 30,000 career employees are going to be wrapped up under the authority of the white house. This means Trump will be installing people across the government, not by their qualifications, but by their loyalty to him to do his bidding. A light version of this already happened in his first term. When a government is filled with sycophants, loyalists, and grifters, it's no longer functional.

America will definitely have difficulty in retooling and retraining, but it retains that capacity for now. Assuming near shoring remains a possibility the economy might still be viable at near current levels.

What we say out loud can shape nations and leave lasting impressions. Our internal dialog shapes our perception of reality. What we tell ourselves is more damaging than any stick or stone. It was pure words, spoken by an evil heart that moved and gave birth to all the hatred that was Nazi Germany. Donald Trump has achieved the same thing in America.  He is using the devils language to tear a nation apart. It is always darkest before the dawn. Even tho Trumps words have given power to those who hate, those who fear they have not snuffed out the idea of America. Nor will they. America's best feature is its diversity. In America, there are more people of German descent than in Germany. And of French, and Chinese and Middle Eastern, and Asian and African and Latino and Jewish and and and and AND!!!Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, Irish, Danish, Italian, and from Tonga America is the land of an idea. It is an idea that WILL live forever. That free men can live together with respect and equal opportunity to grow and prosper. IN PEACE WITH ONE ANOTHER. Was there conflict and tragedy and destruction when this idea was born. YES! Freedom is never free. But in America, we believe in the outnumbered, the out gunned, the underdog. We are the underdog. When England stood against the American colonies, it was France üá´üá∑ who came to America's rescue. It's because of France that America is even a nation. The country that GAVE US ALL THE VERY WORD ""REVOLUTION"", WAS AMERICA'S FIRST DEFENDER! America isn't finished. The experiment isn't over. Only 20% of the American population voted for Trump, 45 to 50 million say 100 million did. There are 300+ million Americans. We have just begun to fight. As in the past, it is Europe that can help America.  Please don't forget we sent our sons 2√ó for the freedom of Europe and that it was America that paid to have Europe rebuilt. All those loans were forgiven after the wars. We are partners in this great experiment called democracy. We are brothers more than you realize. We need each other.

This isn‚Äôt like gay marriage or abortion where views can change through debate. It boils down to whether people view biology/science as transmutable and by its very nature - if you do, it‚Äôs a black/white yes/no topic and no amount of arguing is going to convince them otherwise.

That comment should be tempered with facts and science.  Afterall, gender is a [social construct](https://www.who.int/health-topics/gender#tab=tab_1).  Also, biological sex is not the same thing as gender.

"Trans people on hormones end up with the same biological makeup as cis people, and if they start on blockers young enough, they will never develop the body of their assigned gender. Thus, keeping trans kids out of their identified gender sports is actually forcing 98lb women to face off against 180lb men.

Not only that, but most trans athletes step out of the game during their transition because it‚Äôs such a messy situation and you will have all eyes on you at all times.

It‚Äôs a talking point made up by Rs to make it seem as if it‚Äôs some huge deal across the country that we all need to be very worried about, when the reality is it‚Äôs a handful of cases and, because of the complexity of gender and the transition timeline, should be taken as a case-by-case basis.

You‚Äôre a prime example of why people should be hesitant to speak on issues they‚Äôre not actually knowledgeable about. A good example of why it‚Äôs important to do at least some reading on a subject rather than just confronting spoken word with one-the-spot, made-up logic.

"Appreciation is returned.

We're kind of running head first into the issue, because while trans people are such a small portion of the population, the details of the whole thing, personal, physiological, social aspects of being trans, *are insanely complicated.*

There are both not enough trans people to affect an education by osmosis, just by cultural diffusion, and the real minutiae of things gets very complex and multi-faceted very quickly.

I do not have the answers on the most complicated issues. I staunchly support access to gender affirming care for youth based on my own experience of *not* having it, and for the exact same reason that the sports and athletics conversation is so complicated, because puberty *does* in fact cause physiological changes, based on the dominant sex hormone, that are irreversible and permanent.

It isn't true that there isn't an understanding in the trans community that there is a fundamental difference between cis and trans women. What is true is that difference is often a source of incredible pain, self-alienation, and suffering for trans women. We understand. Trust us, we do.

I think sports issues should be left to their individual leagues, and I would actually really appreciate some *extensive* research into athletic performance for various sports through aspects and stages of medical transition. Partially because I want to find what *is* fair, for everyone, and partially because I think a giant mountain of data on physiological performance through various time frames of HRT would be *really nice* for the trans community to have from a purely medical perspective.

That sounds really useful!

I do believe these conversations are valuable and important. At the same time trans people have been the very specific target of a coordinated attack campaign, and we have to deal with bad faith arguments and questioning, gaslighting, sealioning, and if we have an overly emotional or charged response to people who ultimately have power over us and we are dependent on for compassion and understanding having a ""civil debate"" about just how involved in common, shared, public life we can be, we're branded as extremist, dogmatic, intolerant of other viewpoints, etc.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"Harris made a comment in 2019 about supporting taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries for prisoners. She recanted the statement, but it was too late. We'd need a time machine to undo that mistake.

But overall, I don't accept the premise that the only reason republicans brought up transgender issues is because the dems did it first, that we have to accept republican framing, or that ignoring the issue was a winning strategy. Democrats used to set the topics for discussion. They used to frame the argument on their terms. Rather than accept the premise that men are competing in girl's sports, they could, for example, humanize the issue and immediately redirect.

Allred stepped in it here in Texas when he agreed to Ted Cruz's framing and said that he didn't want men playing in girl's sports. He played right into Cruz's hand. Instead, he could have very quickly given the stats on how many trans athletes are competing in Texas and explain that each sport organization sets reasonable rules and restrictions for individual trans athletes to keep things fair and safe. But what are we doing, involving ourselves in the lives of XX fellow Texans blah blah blah the economy. I'm not a political strategist by any means, but the point would be to acknowledge, humanize & redefine, and redirect the conversation to bread & butter issues. Or call the whole fixation weird, again relying on the stats of how few trans athletes there are. ""Ted Cruz is spending millions to attack trans athletes who make up a fraction of a percentage... blah blah... This issue doesn't affect 99% of Texans, and yet he's wasting millions on harassing a small community in our state. What else is he wasting his time on?"" Acknowledge, humanize & reframe, redirect. 

Would either of these strategies have worked? I dunno. I'm not experienced in campaigning, but I do know that accepting their framing of the issues is an automatic defeat.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

Almost everything in this election can be boiled down to a few simple points. Americans as a general rule under educated with an average reading comprehension level of 5-6th grade depending on the study. The wealth inequality is horrendous causing people to become more and more apathetic with our government. This inequality leads to the division of the classes and to protect the upper echelons of our society the narrative has to be changed to create a culture war. The culture war is what drove this election, as it does in the growth and birth of all Authoritarian governments. 
The only way to have fought and won against such a war was to not have negate with it and hammer home how to shrink the class gaps and how that will help everyone.

Despite whatever left leaning polls that tell you these ads are creating ‚Äòbacklash‚Äô for Republicans - the polling data doesn‚Äôt prove this out. The Dems are losing this fight fast because they have allowed the Reps to paint the Dems with every single extremist view on gender.

2017: 

- Senate was 48/52, with Republican Majority

- Senate will be 47/53, with Republican Majority

- House is currently 209/216, with Republican Majority

While I don't think Democrats will get the House, Republican's can't afford any defections (some of them voted to impeach Trump, others, I imagine, just don't like him). And considering the gridlock in Trump's first term, I'm not sure it's going to change this time.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

It's going to between 220-215 and 224-211. Basically, the current House composition +/- 2, with the most likely outcome is no net change. There is a remote chance that it's +/- 3. A flip seems remote right now. House being productive is even more remote. I don't think even Trump has the leverage (or even desire) to whip everyone into line outside of tax cuts.

A flip in 2 years is basically guaranteed though. Not because it's Trump, but because America loves voting against the people they *just* put in the White House.

They had a much bigger majority in 2017 and still had people with legislative experience running things. The only thing of substance they passed was the TCJA.

>He has a mandate

He's also a lame duck. See George W Bush and his ""political capital"" that bought him fuck-all. 

>virtually every Republican who has resisted him in the past is now gone

Everyone who voted to impeach him is gone. There remains those who are not *openly* hostile, but aren't 100% on board. Look at everyone who closed the loopholes in the succession process that Trump tried to exploit on Jan 6.

Even if someone is mostly pro-Trump, Congressmen still have to worry about the next election. The GOP majority still hinges on a lot of swing districts, and those will be under threat if only because America always votes against the current party in the White House.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

After the resounding victory he had on immigration, they know it is political suicide to oppose finishing the wall. The only thing I could maybe see them thwarting is the tariffs, but my understanding is that he doesn't even need Congress for those either.

<<Even if someone is mostly pro-Trump, Congressmen still have to worry about the next election. The GOP majority still hinges on a lot of swing districts, and those will be under threat if only because America always votes against the current party in the White House.>>

">First term, Trump didn‚Äôt understand as well how Washington works. 

Right, because he's well known as a man of discipline dedicated to learning. They're already repeating the same mistake of delayed/poor transition. They've got a better playbook, but a lot of it leans on executive actions, not legislating. Trump doesn't have the patience, mastery of detail, or inclination to finagle bills through Congress. His underlings don't have the authority to speak for anyone but themselves.

The biggest risk here (outside of another coup, which could unleash something far worse than just Trump if the military steps in) is brain drain in the executive branch. He definitely has the power and people to do damage there.

>While I hear you regarding swing states, those Congressmen have to survive a primary first

Even primary voters lack the patience for a PowerPoint on how Joe Schmoe (R-ETC) slow walked a bill through committee while at the same time going on Fox to rant about trans people like a loyal soldier. 

>As for incumbents, two term presidents are more common than one, so Vance or whoever is going to be in a good position to run in 28

Vance is in terrible position unless Trump literally dies. You can count on the fingers of 1 hand the number of VP's who directly succeeded a living president they served with. Most of those involved the founding fathers. It's happened exactly 1 time since WW2 (Bush I). 

And you can't go claim ""25th amendment"" because the threshold to overthrowing a president via the 25th is ‚Öî of each house. Only a constitutional amendment has a higher bar.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"MMW: Not a single person will be deported like Trump is saying because he‚Äôll realize how horrendously it will sink the economy and how much bad press he‚Äôll get. He‚Äôs said numerous times he doesn‚Äôt want to be a Herbert Hoover and this plan is a guaranteed way to get there. His ego and disdain for bad press will eventually outweigh this ridiculous narrative. Reports internally say Trump still isn‚Äôt fully aware of the economic impact of this plan and his own economic advisors are trying to get him to understand it. This is going to go the way of one giant boogeyman tale. We are far more likely to see the bipartisan border bill put back on the table with some modifications or increased funding and it‚Äôll get pushed through the unified branches immediately and Trump will take credit for it.

People forget at the end of the day that Trump likes winning but he doesn‚Äôt like governing or the role of actually being president. He caters far more to the Wall St crowd and uses the stock market as his polling guide, and he won‚Äôt do anything that‚Äôll sink that.

Republicans aren‚Äôt ‚Äúwrong‚Äù that we have an illegal immigration problem. 100% we do. Even more liberal countries that as a liberal I usually point to, have much more strict immigration policies. A lot of that is because of where they are geographically, but regardless it‚Äôs true. 

Democrats just worry that this is going to lead to gestapo like knock and enter raids - which honestly is very unlikely - even republicans would lose their goddamned minds about that. But - we always fear the worst of our perceived enemy. 

Republicans are going to need to figure this one out. They have an opportunity to fix a problem that is real, but they also have a huge risk that fixing this problem could collapse industries, skyrocket the cost of food and goods, and lead to massive increased violence against white Americans and authorities. 

If you‚Äôre taking folks away from their children, ripping apart families, and throwing people into jails and camps while waiting for deportation - you‚Äôre going to quickly have millions of folks who are scared for their lives, and potentially feeling the need to protect themselves against police officers, and honestly white Americans in general.

Slavery wasn‚Äôt completely abolished after the Civil War.  Felons in prison can be forced to do labor.  Trump could very easily set up kangaroo courts to rubber-stamp convictions and turn internment camp inmates into slaves. 

This is pretty much par for fascist regimes.  Stalin had the gulags, Hitler had his concentration camps, and Mao had his re-education camps.  Trump‚Äôs team is putting his deportation camps, and the special paramilitary units that will abduct people from their homes to fill them, as their first priority.  

By this time next year neighborhood raids will be common.  By this time the year after he will be well on his way to enslaving 5% of the population.  Many of those will be ‚Äúthe enemy within,‚Äù aka his political opponents and others that are insufficiently loyal to him personally. 

Could we escape this fate?  Probably not; the slide from democracy into fascism is historically a one-way trip.  We had a chance last Tuesday to hang on a bit longer but the MAGAs decided fascism would be fun, so we‚Äôre sliding fast now.

IF trump actually follows through with mass deportations to the scale he promises. Those detainment will be even more overcumbered, perhaps they end up biting more than they can chew.


The best case scenario is that they don't actually deport ALL illegals and go after naturalised citizens like they say they would.

>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt listen enough; we tell people what‚Äôs good for them,‚Äù Murphy said.

>‚ÄúAnd when progressives like [Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)] aggressively go after the elites that hold people down, they are shunned as dangerous populists. Why? Maybe because true economic populism is bad for our high-income base,‚Äù he added.

>In the wake of the 2024 elections, Democrats from different parts of the party have gone after each other for what they think sunk their chances at the polls, as they lost the Senate, the presidency and possibly the House.

For those not around or not aware of Cheney's moral depravity: he knew there were no WMD in Iraq, strongarmed the international community to lie about it, and then proceeded anyway, resulting in the deaths of millions of Iraqis.

>In the fall of 2002, the United States finally gained the chance to obtain solid on-the-ground intelligence. With the U.S. threatening war unless Iraq turned over weapons that didn't exist, Saddam allowed U.N. weapons inspectors to return. A Swedish diplomat, Hans Blix, was placed in charge and visited with Cheney on October 30, 2002. **According to Blix, Cheney delivered a stern message: If inspectors failed to discover WMDs, the administration would discredit them.**

>By February 2003, Blix believed the Iraqis were largely cooperating. He met with senior American officials, including Rice, telling them that the intelligence he had obtained from the Americans was poor and that none of the suspected weapons sites identified by the CIA held WMDs. American intelligence wasn't on trial, Rice replied. **Blix was supposed to find the weapons, not question the quality of the CIA's work.**

>**When Blix's inspectors came up empty, the Bush administration demanded that they portray the equivalent of popguns as major threats.** For example, officials told Blix that two items found by inspectors‚Äî**a balsa wood drone** with a motorcycle engine and a rusted, decades-old bomb that amounted to little more than a massive paperweight‚Äîshould be declared violations of the WMD restrictions. **When Blix scoffed at this, administration officials anonymously leaked lies that misrepresented what the two items were, falsely declared that the inspection team thought they constituted violations of the U.N. weapons restrictions on Iraq, and attacked Blix for hiding the truth to prevent war. Ultimately, Blix found nothing.** And, just as Cheney promised, the administration dismissed this strong intelligence as meaningless.

The misinformation comes from the same sources that they're plugged into. It's an organized and funded push of disinformation/misinformation and the far right-wing have a well developed network for media distribution. Someone made that ""PLandemic"" movie and were ready to go with it very early on. They get a couple of podcasters to talk about it one day, then boom, it's all over FB. 

It's the same with all of it to a degree. Make something up, get the talking heads to speak on it, offer up some soundbites and memes to be spread on socials, have an ""expert"" misconstrue existing research.

Everything gets more complex when u have multiple methods spreading the misinformation all across internet/tv/apps,even, as finding the source of the spread takes time. One branch is shut down, another ten pop up. The FBI is in an ongoing game of wack-a-mole with this shit.

"You can't possibly believe that, can you?  I can't believe I have to waste my time in saying this but...you need to not buy everything you hear on Fox News, they have claimed in court that no same individual goes to them for news...they're in the **opinion** business, apparently.  They admit to lying.  It's a business, and all those flags don't mean they're not lying.

It's ridiculous to even have to point this out...while Trump could have said ""with the help of Obama and our allies, the United States has defeated ISIS"" and he'd be mostly right, because he *mostly* finished the job that was begun years previously.  But he didn't say that, he had to denounce Obama and allies as not as effective as himself, he announced when we would pull troops out of Syria (a handout to Putin, additionally), which betrayed the Kurds (gift to Erdogan, additionally) and destroyed any future alliance with this pro-American group in that region.  

Then, in Afghanistan, Trump brokers a ""deal"" with the Taliban (a terrorist organization staffed with former Al-Qaida members), excluding the government, and set a hard date for troop withdrawal that would put the responsibility for it on the Biden administration.  Trump ""gave"" the Taliban 5000 prisoners from the Afghan government without even informing the government they were doing so.  That part fell through, pissing off the Taliban, and so they started breaking their agreement brokered by Trump, attacking Afghani forces.  Trump calls the Taliban ""very smart, very sharp, very tough"" while they partner with Al-Qaida to attack a government the United States was formerly supporting.  Many Republicans say the plan to move troops out quickly will embolden our enemies (which it did). Once in office, Biden commits to upholding the US (Trump) agreement with the Taliban, his main mistake.  Trump then criticizes Biden for not going even faster.  The Taliban attacks increase in intensity.  Biden commits to a quick pullout while Trump is announcing that there were no problems with the Taliban while he was president.  The Afghan government and our military experts said the Trump deal was poorly executed and set up the situation to which the chance of failure was high.  Maybe that was the plan all along?  Either way, Trump is/was either an idiot or evil (why not both?)

Second, we never pulled out of Syria and we still have bases there and in Iraq. Wrong again. We conduct special operations there all the time. 

Thirdly, Biden and the military fucked up so bad in Afghanistan you can‚Äôt even try to defend what happened and expect anyone with a military background or knowledge to not laugh in your face. 

Isis rose to significance in 2014. It would be naive for me to cast blame on anyone, or any political party, or president for its creation. But what is true is ISIS rose to power and conducted horrific atrocities in multiple countries under Obamas administration. In 2014 they created their self proclaimed caliphate in Raqqa and seized control of vast parts of Syria and northern Iraqi. They captured Mosul with a population of over 1 million people. I‚Äôm sure you already know all of this üôÑ. Among the many horrific attacks by them was in Paris in Nov. of 2015. Not to mention also those barbaric videos they released. 

It wasn‚Äôt until July 17th, 2017 that Iraqi with the help of American troops regained Mosul. Almost two years after Obama left office. In 2018 the USA dropped the mother of all bombs on ISIS in Afghanistan. It took time to bring ISIS to their knees in that region. But none of the progress was made under Obamas leadership. 

The Trump administration wasn‚Äôt perfect don‚Äôt get me wrong. But what he did do was create the strongest team possible to solve a problem. I think his greatest quality is building teams. As commander in chief he empowered our military to get the job done and they did.",2024_11_11,17_08_15

"Interesting fact, I have a pretty long military record...I don't care to hear much about military anything from people because most of it is so beyond mis- or under-informed..  I spent a decade serving in the Army and I am disgusted that people give him a pass for his threats to NATO members after having served in Europe for several NATO missions, earning some snazzy NATO medals and lots of interesting stories. Those days look like they're gonna be behind us, and our only allies will be authoritarian dictatorships.  Sounds super American.  As a veteran, it makes me literally sick to my stomach.

You're not hearing the point I'm making about Afghanistan.  Have you listened to Gen. Milley or many of the other DOD officials that spoke up about it?  Oh wait, Milley's probably deep state because Trump wanted him fired for ""insubordination"" (so ridiculous you'd think this shit was made up, we're talking about the chairman of JCS).  Mistakes were **absolutely** made, 100%, as they often do in such pullouts historically, but they were **greatly** exacerbated by Trump's inane actions working with the Taliban.  He should have never made that deal and he should have done what the US historically has the precedent for doing--work closely with an incoming administration.  I blame Biden for mistakes he made, I blame Trump for mistakes he made...but it's almost unforgivable to work **against** your fellow Americans because they are members of a different political party.  He has torn this country apart and IT won't stop until people wake the fuck up.

If you didn't hear it on Fox, I'm sorry, but the point stands...It's ALL right wing talking points and all bullshit I've heard that's so easy to disprove.  Just do a bit of research on your own.  Maybe don't look for things that support your perspective and ignore anything that goes against it.

If you blame Obama for ISIS (that's laying a lot of blame), then you must blame Trump for the hundreds of thousands of unnecessary dead Americans from COVID, as his mishandling of it was atrocious and it was on his watch. Whereas the US handling of inflation has been objectively better than the rest of the world, Out COVID results were much worse.  I know people that died because he said that masks were ineffective and people should use horse dewormer (and light in the veins, and bleach).  You must also blame Trump for the Turkish incursion into Syria on his watch.  And it should bother you that Russia was found to be interfering in our democracy, yet Trump said he believed Putin over his **own country's intelligence apparatus**.  He didn't just let it happen, he urged it on...then said he sides with one doing the interference.

You seem to have heard nothing I said and that's so typical, unfortunately, today.  Were you asleep when he fucked the Kurds?  Look, I grew up in a Republican household long ago and we argued but they didn't worship a cult of personality following the fascism playbook.  It's not even Trump's fault, it's America's fault.
