"Taking the dog out.  My retired white dude neighbor was up and about, seemed odd for a retired guy on a weekend.  He told me he was off to volunteer.  I asked where, he hesitated for a minute, and then told me he's canvassing for Harris today.  He's the kind of guy I'd be hard-pressed to pin down politically from our former interactions.

">But this home stretch of the campaign hadn’t just been hard and stressful; it had been disillusioning. Several campaign officials had told me, throughout the spring and summer, how excited they were about working in the next Trump White House. Now those same people were telling me—as paperwork was being distributed internally to begin the process of placing personnel on the transition team and in the prospective administration—that they’d had a change of heart. The past three months had been the most unpleasant of their careers. Win or lose, they said, they were done with the chaos of Donald Trump—even if the nation was not.

Probably the most damning thing in that Atlantic article that was full of damning comments.

"Posted this in the older thread. Reposting here - 

Georgia's early voting has ended, and from an analytical standpoint, every metric I'd want to see for a Harris victory is present.

Let's break down why. 🍑

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681109546353097?s=46

Metro Atlanta finished strong, with large counties recording ~80,000 votes in just the final two hours (5-7 PM) yesterday.

Polls closed in rural counties at 5 pm, so Democratic counties drove that final surge.

This surge could preview Election Day potential.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681112780423197?s=46

Current early voting totals in key counties:

Fulton: 57.9%

DeKalb: 58.1%

Gwinnett: 54.6%

Cobb: 60.2%

Clayton: 46.3%

Chatham: 48.1%

Richmond: 42.8%

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681115032781024?s=46

The story varies significantly by county. Gwinnett, despite its size and importance, has the most ground to cover to match its total 2020 turnout.

At 54.6%, it needs 96.2% of its 2020 Election Day performance to match overall 2020 turnout.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681117633233217?s=46

Other Metro Atlanta counties have built more cushion through early voting.

DeKalb can match 2020 with 79.6% of its previous Election Day turnout.

Cobb, thanks to strong early voting at 60.2%, needs just 75.8%.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681120045027676?s=46

Fulton, Clayton, and Chatham all need about 67% of their 2020 Election Day numbers - significant cushion built through early voting success.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681140727169382?s=46

A key indicator for Harris:

Women's turnout has already exceeded 2020 levels, reaching 56% versus 55.3% in the last cycle.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681357752668251?s=46

The 2020 to 2024 comparison reveals a crucial shift: Metro Atlanta voted heavily by mail in 2020 due to COVID.

This year, a large pool of traditional Election Day voters remains available.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681444654735746?s=46

Meanwhile, rural northeast Georgia—Republican strongholds—has nearly exhausted its voter pool, with few Election Day voters left.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681538087035022?s=46

Metro Atlanta as well as other blue counties all retain substantial untapped potential voters.

Those final two hours of early voting demonstrated the capacity for high turnout in these population centers.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681756518096930?s=46

This sets up a fascinating Election Day dynamic:

Metro Atlanta and other blue counties have both more work to do AND more voters available to do it.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681878492569669?s=46

The pressure point is Gwinnett, where matching 2020 numbers will require the strongest Election Day performance relative to last cycle.

If you have some time between now and Election Day, please volunteer to canvass and help GOTV.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852682170193875302?s=46

Let's return to the Harris victory metrics:

I’m not seeing any signs of Democratic demoralization in Metro Atlanta's strong early voting numbers, while Trump faces headwinds in maxed-out rural areas.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852682392391303673?s=46

These aren't predictions - they're patterns.

But the checklist of what Harris would need for victory in Georgia has been steadily filled during early voting.

"So this is for anyone that sees the “text your Trump leaning friends and try to convince them” comments but you don’t because you really doubt they will and you could just end up fighting:

My best friend, practically my little brother, is a Libertarian but voted for Trump twice and was leaning that way again. Everytime we talked politics it would hurt me because his actions didn’t match a Trump voter. When Biden fumbled that last debate, he was gloating that “Dems made their bed by sticking with him”.

Since then we hadn’t talked politics. I hadn’t heard his thoughts on Harris. Well I decided to text him and he opened up that while he didn’t want to lean Dem, he can’t deny Trump had fallen off since Harris took over and he saw the racism (he is dating a Latina so maybe she helped him see the light lol). And boom. He sent me a pic of his “I Voted” sticker and said it was for Harris. And for me to never bring it up again lol.

1. 25% Unrealized capital gains will lose him a quarter of the value on his home
2. Kamala wants to put price caps on everything which will crash the economy because if you cut profitability you'll have a shortage of goods

I told him the capital gains tax is only for people with a net worth over $100 million (he's poor) and they're not price caps it's a ban on price gouging for groceries ONLY and that would not ban companies from raising costs but only stop them from unfairly ripping off consumers during crises and would have no impact on the economy. I sent him evidence of this and also proof of Trump wanting to slap 20% tariffs on all imports and deport 11 million workers and how that would immediately decimate the economy. 

He replied that what he said is true and what I said is liberal propaganda.

He did the thing that nobody thought would happen and stepped down from the nomination once it became clear he was too old to keep the office. Mad respect for that.

Anyway. 

The great results got me thinking about an anecdote that Kamala told in an interview (I *think* it may have been “Call Her Daddy” or an old MSNBC news story, can’t recall). 

But in the interview, Kamala was speaking about being used to being the underdog and being underestimated but still working her butt off to defy expectations. She also pointed out that her mother knew that once she put her mind to accomplish something, nothing could stop her.

As an example, she talked about how, when she had started campaigning for AG, her mother was in the late stages of cancer, and could barely muster up any energy. One day, Kamala came to share something with her along the lines of, “Mommy, can you believe what he (Steve Cooley) said? He said he’s gonna whoop my butt in the race!” (or something along those lines).

Her mother’s response, in Kamala’s own words: “She laughed and laughed that great laugh of hers.” 

As we all know, Harris went on to win the AG race (though her mother did not live to see it).",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"[For those of you who want to know what a 42% WWC voter turnout and 3+ Iowa Harris lead would look like nationally...](https://i.imgur.com/kG835q5.jpeg)

This includes 2% 3rd party support away from Harris for all but the WWC voters, which I took 3rd party 2% away from Trump for because I expect protest votes on both sides of the aisle to still be a thing.

It also points to turnout being higher for all non white working class demos, hence the 42% estimate which has been a commonly cited guess for final turnout of that demo. This points to big increases in black, Latino and asian turnout in the 4-6% range. Obviously that could easily be overly optimistic, but the point is to get this to hit both Iowa 3+ and have that demo's turnout hit the expected 42% number. I was initially assuming Trump might do better with minorities, but I think the MSG rally really is going to screw him over there. The minority turnout would be the Dem's version of low propensity voters who will not fully show until election day, so it'd be in line with the theory of Dem leaners voting later as well, especially in younger demos.

This also presumes a very high turnout election (165-170 million), which I think is still plausible by the end of Tuesday. I could of course see final turnout being lower, but I still don't think that helps Trump. If anything, I think lower turnout will show among his base than the Dem base.

More realistically, I still expect Trump to overperform that poll by 1-3 points, but he would need to do better than that to still win Iowa, which is... possible, but kind of absurd since it would be better than his 2 point 2016 swing in the same poll.

Obviously, this is a super zooming/blooming result, but it's actually not far off from what I've been guessing before. I don't think a lot of people see what may be coming, and I've been saying it here for months.

Anybody among you can go play with the slider tools on Cook. They are great things to experiment with when polling data comes out. I'm not just trying to be optimistic for the sake of it, I'm going based off of enthusiasm I hear on the ground and other metrics. I fully understand that this result could be wrong, but... yeah...",2024_11_03,05_39_46

She was a lawyer and I always had the impression she had absolutely no tolerance for nonsense but I just...I didn't know what to hope for, she sucked in a breath over her teeth and said: ""I voted for Obama...but *never* tell your father."" She's said many times since that the thing she *actually* is politically doesn't exist anymore, if it ever really did, and she votes for the kind of future she wants for me and my sister now. I am so unspeakably grateful that I don't have to have conversations with her now that are going on nationally about how *her vote is private*. But it's absolutely and utterly a thing that I do not doubt is going on in many homes across the U.S. - my family had this happen earlier, but yours could be doing it right now. Whoever she is and whatever her flaws, if you (or your mom or sister or any female relative or friend) is realigning right now try to extend her what grace you can offer here. It doesn't have to be perfect and neither does she, to still be worth the gratitude. I get to have a deep, adult relationship with my mom because of what she did and then needed to keep secret at that time.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"Selzer Poll - 

1. The poll shows that women — particularly those who are older or who are politically independent — are driving the late shift toward Harris. 

2. Independent voters, who had consistently supported Trump in the leadup to this election, now break for Harris. That’s driven by the strength of independent women, who back Harris by a 28-point margin, while independent men support Trump, but by a smaller margin. 

3. Senior voters who are 65 and older favor Harris. But senior women support her by a more than 2-to-1 margin, 63% to 28%, while senior men favor her by just 2 percentage points, 47% to 45%.  

4. Where Trump is over performing - 76% of likely Iowa voters for Trump are 'extremely' or 'very' enthusiastic, compared with 71% for Harris.

5. The poll shows few likely Iowa voters remain undecided, with 91% saying their minds are made up, compared with 80% in September. That includes 96% of Harris supporters who are firm in their choice and 95% of Trump supporters.   

6. Independent likely voters, who have supported Trump in every other Iowa Poll this year, now favor Harris, 46% to 39%.  

7. Independent women choose Harris over Trump 57% to 29%. That’s up from September, when independent women gave her just a 5-point lead, 40% to 35%.  

8. Independent men still favor Trump 47% to 37% — numbers that are largely unchanged from September, when independent men supported him 46% to 33%.  

9. Overall, Harris holds a 20-point lead with women, 56% to 36%, similar to where she was in September. 

10. But Trump’s lead with men has shrunk from 27 points in September (59% to 32%) to 14 points today (52% to 38%).

11. Harris holds a small lead with likely Iowa voters who are younger than 35, 46% to 44% over Trump.  

12. Harris’ larger support among likely voters 65 and older, who prefer her 55% to 36%, could be a boon, because older Iowans tend to be more reliable voters and show up at disproportionately higher rates.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"The really magical thing about if that Iowa poll is accurate is that it puts the Republican party in an *impossible* position. Trump would be so firmly, obviously toxic to them that they would have no choice but to finally break from him, but a significant chunk of his loyal followers would never, ever go along with it. You'd see a degree of right-wing infighting that would likely destroy them in the midterms and quite probably in 2028.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"Here in IL, the most common attack ad against Harris has been over her support of Trans people.  Looking at the Iowa poll, trans issues doesn't even register as an issue for either side.

I think other red states in Midwest probably will not have enough shift to change the outcome, with the exception of Ohio. But now I feel bullish about the Blue Wall, and Democrat's chance in the election.

It's like barometer to gauge the sentiment to give 5-8 % more popularity in national levels (i.e if Selzer poll is +4% for R, then likely D is +4 more popular in national level) but now D is +3 in IA so you can do the math

This is the one poll that continued to output good quality results, even in the face of Trumpism and during the COVID years. So them saying that Harris would win *Iowa* is absolutely bonkers.

This poll is massive good news for Harris and finally shows something I’ve been seeing myself which is that the polls and what I’m observing do not match at all. In past elections I could tell if it was close. This election from what I can observe doesn’t feel like a close election even though the polls say it is.

"> During the first three weeks of October, Donald Trump staged a remarkable comeback, rebounding from a huge deficit to a commanding lead. 

I'm sorry, the ""data"" showing a consistently tight race was a ""commanding lead?""

> Trump moved relentlessly upwards in the electoral vote count, as forecast by the Miller framework

Ahh, ok, so you're basing this off of, from what I can tell, is an economic theory?

Here's some more slant from the article:

> The Biden administration’s policy of sending arms to Israel for bolstering its forces in the war versus Iran, and to Ukraine for fortifying its campaign to defeat the the Russian invasion is deeply troubling to a large swath of the electorate—especially since it’s unclear how long those conflicts, and hence our involvement, will last.

Alright, let's make things clear. Joe Biden has been stuck between a rock and a hard place ever since he came into office, so make no mistake here, if the U.S. refused to send aid to its allies, Biden would undoubtedly be facing even harsher criticism.

Putin's invasion of Ukraine was all but inevitable, and the conflict in Israel has been going on for over a century, ever since the signing of the Balfour declaration after WW1.

Joe Biden did not start these wars, full stop, in fact, judging by Trump's mutually beneficial relationship with Putin and his disastrous foreign policy endeavors, it's probable that Trump helped accelerate Putin's autocratic and unjustified invasion. Oh, I'm sorry, ""special military occupation,"" err, I mean ""operation.""

What's more, Trump's ""middle east peace deal"" was anything but. It was a poorly contrived, amateurish political stunt that happened to coincide with his reelection campaign. It was laughably brief, he didn't even conceive of it himself and he failed to get the appropriate signatures and concessions.

This combined with his capitulation to far right Israeli leaders only heightened tensions in the region. His evidently ineffectual ""Abraham Accords,"" his controversial recognition of the annexation of The Golan Heights, and his contentious order to relocate the U.S embassy in Israel, weakened our position as peace brokers between Israelis and Palestinians while escalating tensions there.

What's more, Trump was seen as such a dangerous interventionist that Congress passed not one, but TWO historic war powers resolutions.

Let's not forget that Trump withdrew from the working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, resulting in more provocations in the region and Iran upscaling its nuclear program. According to current U.S. assessments, Iran could now make enough fissile for one nuclear bomb in under two weeks. Under the agreement Trump abandoned, it would’ve taken Iran at least a year.

During the Trump administration, the U.S. was also engaged in military conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and more than 60 American soldiers died in hostile action.

And despite criticisms from Republicans, it was Trump who literally negotiated with terrorists and ordered direct talks with the Taliban without consulting with our allies and partners or allowing the Afghan government at the negotiating table

Trump emboldened the Taliban by publicly considering inviting them to Camp David on the anniversary of 9/11.

As part of the withdrawal deal, Trump also pressured the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban fighters from prison, including senior war commanders, without securing the release of the only American hostage known to be held by the Taliban.

During the transition from Trump to Biden, the outgoing Administration provided no plans for how to conduct the final withdrawal or to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies.

And don't get me started on Trump's efforts to align himself with Putin and the Kremlin agenda, while emboldening Putin and his greatest goal of weakening NATO. Senior administration officials revealed that multiple times during his presidency, Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from NATO. And don't forget that Trump was impeached for withholding Javelin missiles from Ukraine in 2019. There aren't enough characters in a reddit post to cover it all. But I'd be happy to lay it all out for those who think otherwise.

If only these low propensity voters deciding the outcome of our elections were actually informed of Trump's disastrous presidency, there would have never been a ""commanding lead"" in the first place.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"Payway, but I'm guessing whoever wrote this model doesn't understand how election prediction works.  These models are not polls, just statistics.  Being 10 points ahead in a poll means a candidate has that race in the bad (almost certainly).  Being 10 points ahead in a prediction model is barely better than a coin toss.  45 chances to pick black vs 55 chances to pick white.  Prior to MSG, Trump was doing about this well in a lot of the prediction models.  Now, for all intents and purposes, it's a tie in these models, and is unlikely to change in the next couple of days.

So no, Trump never had a huge lead, and polls never changed from a virtual dead heat.

Worth noting that there may be issues with the polls that these models are based off of, but for once, any errors see, as likely to be in Harris' favor vs Trump's..

> that they can’t afford to buy a first home because mortgage rates are so high


As someone who recently bought my first home, I can say that interest rates don't have anything to do with it being unaffordable. Houses just cost a lot. And I think any person shopping for a house knows that. 


Whether they blame Biden is a different matter (I don't, but I'm sure many do.)


The extra cost from an additional 3 or 4% interest is trivial for your monthly budget. Having to pay $300k for a house that sold for $120k in 2020 isn't. 


And I don't blame Biden for it. It's multifactorial. 


I actually like Miller. I find him to be fair about the criticisms of his method. He's interesting even when I disagree. However, seeing a statement like ""people can't afford houses due to interest rates"" is a red flag that the speaker might be disconnected from the community that they're trying to talk about. ",2024_11_03,05_39_46

It's almost like he's going back to his pre-2016 idea of ""the best way get publicity is to *run* for president, not to become president"" and I could understand that perfectly, except for the fact that he's obviously also running to stay out of prison.

I think a longer rundown of Trump and Putin would be amazing. This was a great analytical breakdown for anyone who wanted to learn more about the events that happened during his presidency and points to debate anyone who claims otherwise,2024_11_03,05_39_46
"> his controversial recognition of the annexation of The Golan Heights, and his contentious order to relocate the U.S embassy in Israel, weakened our position as peace brokers between Israelis and Palestinians while escalating tensions there.

It's clear that Trump, being a terrible negotiator, gave up diplomatic positions where the US had a lot of leverage in exchange for *nothing* in return.  But at the same time, in retrospect it is very clear that the West playing ""both sides"" on this issue has only served to provide money and power to terrorists and resulted in a lot of people getting killed.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"> What's more, Trump's ""middle east peace deal"" was anything but. 

[From this article written in 2020:](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2020/02/im-a-veteran-middle-east-peace-negotiator-trumps-plan-is-the-most-dangerous-ive-ever-seen?lang=en)    
 
>Still, I look back now and feel that if we had really been acting as Israel’s lawyers, then we clearly failed. If you really want to see lawyers in action, take a look at the peace plan that the firm of Trump, Jared Kushner, Jason Greenblatt and David Friedman have put on the table. It’s neither a basis for immediate negotiations nor a framework that might serve as a future basis for talks. It is the ultimate product of pro-Israel lawyering at its best – an effort to use words like “state” and “capital in Jerusalem” to mask a unilateral effort to bring America’s conception of the final status of the West Bank in line with that of Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israel. It is an effort to fundamentally and unalterably drive the final stake through the heart of a two-state solution.

>The irony, of course, is that this really hasn’t done the State of Israel any great favors. It’s one thing to tilt toward Israel in a negotiation. It’s quite another to try to so totally move the goalposts and make any kind of agreement with the Palestinians nearly impossible to achieve.    
    
And then there's this, which almost prophetically explains the exact things that have been draped on Biden's handling of the conflict...and how they were the direct result of what happened prior to him ever taking office:    
    
>When he has sought my advice during the past couple of years, I have advised Jared Kushner not to become Israel’s lawyer. The last time I met with Kushner, he asked me what, in my view, would constitute success on his part. I made it clear that there was zero chance of reaching a conflict-ending accord, as neither Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas nor Netanyahu were willing or able to make the decisions required to achieve one. 

>But I also told him that if he wasn’t careful, he could make the situation a great deal worse. The key was to put something out that was credible and would put America in position to be seen as a party that could be trusted by all sides to work on the issue in the future. Whatever Israel and the Palestinians need to succeed in making peace, what they don’t need is precisely what the Kushner law firm delivered: a framework that may well have hung a closed-for-the-season sign both on a viable peace process and America’s credibility as a fair and effective broker.    
    
Or, or succinctly as it was put in this Washington Post article about a year later (and like with pretty much everything else he touches), [Trump made things worse.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/05/12/so-much-abraham-accords-trump-made-things-worse-middle-east/)",2024_11_03,05_39_46

(b) We now have THREE years for the first time of having ZERO American troops dying in Afghanistan, thanks to Biden. Something the previous three presidents could not do. Leaving aside the 60-65 troops who died under Trump's watch in Afghanistan compared to the 13 during the withdrawal that everyone knew would be disastrous.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"They are not even talking about polls. From the article:

“Miller bases his model not on the polls or opinions of the pundits, but on the prediction or betting markets. His main data source are the prices posted on what he deems the most trustworthy, and highly liquid, political wagering platformÚ PredictIt.”

 “Miller notes that he assessed the GOP tilt in the 2020 races for PredictIt, and made the right adjustments for it, as evidenced by the accuracy of his forecasts. For the 2024 election, he’s using the same correction methodology he deployed four years ago. But now, though he hasn’t put precise numbers on the difference, Miller reckons that the betting sites lean more strongly to the GOP than in 2020.”

“The sites overestimate the GOP odds, he says, in part because the betters are mainly males who often also wager on sports, and love taking risks. He adds that Musk’s lavish praise for prediction markets may have pushed the scales in further the Trump-Vance direction, noting that a few Trump “whales” could be inflating his odds of victory on some markets that allow individuals to wager unlimited sums.”

The next day, Trump headed his blowout at MSG, and no sooner did the giant screens go blank than he started losing ground. On Monday, Harris gained 18 electoral votes, and she kept improving every day through midnight on Thursday. By then, Harris had gained 58. Trump’s lead shrank by over half from 196 to 80.

This is the opposite. The general polls are tight, but every other metric suggests otherwise. Anytime they focus on a demographic group it just shows Trump is bleeding support from them.

I’ve been voting since 2008 and this is the first time I have EVER seen this many republicans endorsing a democrat. 

And even if we pay attention to polls outside of the specific demographic one- polls in non-swing states like Kansas, Ohio and etc are showing Trump not performing the numbers he has had previously.

Every time I poke my head out to see conservative rallying points (and then fact check) it turns out bunk or misleading compared to the context.

Some jurisdictions have nutters setting drop off boxes on fire. Some jurisdictions have nutters with massive firearms intimidating voters. And some jurisdictions, his preferred chums have rules such as they can contest the legitimacy of a vote for any reason, those have to be counted by hand, and there is a strict deadline that must be met...basically making it impossible all of the votes will be counted before they need to be certified.  

Honestly, while I agree that what happened in 2016 is a great example as to why polling systems need to be often re-examined and re-evaluated, it's also extremely difficult to call how the race is going to turn out when it very well might be decided by external factors that are about as far from voter opinions or preferences as is possible to be.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"Here’s the thing though, economists and business experts predict Trump’s economic plan, primarily compromised of tariffs and tax cuts (benefitting the wealthy most) would likely send the US into a recession by 2026, shrink GDP, and skyrocket unemployment. His tariffs alone would raise prices for consumers and businesses, particularly small businesses will be impacted if they import anything. Also his plan is estimated to add 2.5 times more trillions to our debt over 10 years compared to Kamala’s plan. Hers would grow GDP and includes investments via tax cut incentives for the middle class and small businesses. 

So while *he could benefit from Biden’s policies and recovery* if he wins and any of his actual economic plans are enacted the US economy could likely nosedive. 

The choice could not be more clear in this election. On every single issue, the choice is starkly different with both candidates.

"The assassination attempt in Butler faded fast for a few reasons:

- All Trump had to show for it was a nicked ear.  Possibly not even by a bullet.  And no visible chunks missing from said ear.  Good photo op for him (clenched fist raised), which worried a lot of us.
- The firefighter died, but Trump failed to call his widow in the days afterwards.
- The shooter was someone who leaned Republican.  I say ""leaned"" because it's murky.
- The shooter died and didn't leave a manifesto or make a big splash.

That was the immediate 24 hours.  It looked like a really good bump for Trump. With the imagery and sympathy.

Fast forward a few days and you have the RNC (Wed-Fri?).  Now all the news media is covering *that* instead of the attempt in Butler.  Plus Trump is throwing away the sympathy card by being a jackass about it.

Fast forward just a few more days and you have Biden dropping out on Sunday after the RNC.  Biden stepping down from running right after the RNC had to have been planned.  It was a well executed pivot by someone who's been in the business for like 50+ years.

"And I wish the media would start re-iterating that Donald Trump's ego isn't what's on the line with this election.  His literal freedom is on the line.  This menace and his pathetic, antisocial cult are making a mockery of our election system because the only reason Donald is running is to stay out of prison.

But when Kamala wins, we will have Donald's NYS criminal trial sentencing on I believe November 16th.  I have no doubt Merchan will hand out an actual prison sentence and that will be the first domino to fall.  Next up will be Trump's DC federal trial.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"Trump focused the brunt of his last-minute messaging at ~30 million young men who trust Bob Lazar more than Antony Fauci. 

His most expensive and persistent ad buy was warning ~20 million football fans that Trans women run *really* fast.

Last weekend he had a surrogate, at the biggest rally of his political career, call a million swing state voters ""garbage,"" then pretended it didn't happen.

Another of those surrogates, again during the biggest rally of his career, called Hillary Clinton (???) a ""Jew-hating bastard"" and immediately afterwards condemned ""these fucking illegals.""

He simulated oral sex on a microphone on stage in front of a live audience.

He suggested Liz Cheney should be executed by a firing squad. 

He said he'd do what he want about women's health ""whether the women like it or not.""

"Trump has known and been told he's never going to win another election since 2017. But his narcissistic ego blocks such self-realization until he gets closer to actually losing. Then, when he loses, he's in denial about it, of course.

And like any textbook malignant narcissist, all of this is enabled by the sycophants he surrounds himself with -- the same ones who he will blame for the (""mistaken!"") perception that he lost.

Meanwhile, he satisfies himself by grifting people for chump change and making sure that whatever is topping the news has his name involved in it ASAP.

This is the pathetic little cowardly grifter that so many Americans think is anything but one of the biggest jokes and losers in the world...",2024_11_03,05_39_46

My Dad is fairly agreeable and hes in denial and resistant despite having taken a rather comprehensive test that took hours.

Two, pollsters are adjusting Trump polls up assuming they underrepresent Trump like in 2016 and 2020.

In fact, the trend of Independents holding their nose and voting for Trump is likely to translate far more into voting Harris or just refraining from voting.

Our population increased by four percent in one year which is huge. They've recently pumped the brakes on that. Inflation is quite high (though lower than the g7 average). Housing inflation is insane though. While some trends with housing predate Trudeau his immigration policies are blamed for this, at least in part. Canada is one of the most well educated countries on the planet but our productivity lags the US. That's off the top of my head. Personally, while I do like Trudeau as a person, I've not voted for him. It's not a bold statement to say he's only where he is due to his last name (his father was a long-term Prime Minister). One thing I do like about him is he brought in a carbon tax, but there's been great success from the right in linking the carbon tax to inflation even though studies regularly show that it's unrelated.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"We have a smarmy little weasel (Pierre Poilievre) running the opposition. Same bullshit tactics, same three word slogans. He has continued to vote against programs that actually help real people then complains about the inevitable outcome of those decisions. He refuses to get a security clearance as it's speculated he has a few skeletons in his closet including interference from the Indian government that led to him being named leader of the opposition. He appeals to the same demographic that Trump appeals to. When the ""Trucker Convoy' happened in Ottawa he was in the streets handing out donuts and coffee to the people who were blocking streets, blocking traffic lanes to hospitals, clogging 911 phones lines, etc. and shut down a major bridge used for cross border traffic as well as a major border crossing in Alberta. Many of those people involved are currently in court after being charge with myriad crimes related to the protests.

Trudeau is suffering from voter burnout. He has won the three previous elections and therefore everything that is wrong with the country is his fault even if a good chunk of the problems are the result of conservative Premiers who have provincial jurisdiction. He admittedly has made some questionable decisions and many people didn't like how he handled the Covid situation. I'm not a huge fan but compared to Poilievre he is the sane choice however people are sort of sick of Trudeau and we tend to vote people out rather than voting the other party in. I'm very much in the middle. I'm lean Liberal with most social issues and lean a lot more conservative when it comes to economy and crime so don't feel like I have a home with either party.

It also was totalitarian, with both bureaucratic and military aspects of the state being under Palpatine's direct control, and in the vast majority of cases, they were one and the same. The Senate technically existed, but nobody took opposition seriously (e.g. Mon Mothma) and it was practically powerless relative to Palpatine's desires. Any time individual rights could be violated for the stability or interest of the Empire, they were violated, and people accepted this state of affairs because of the promise that it was for the sake of the empire.

A sign of government control, not a defining feature of fascism alone. A socialist or communist country would do the same.

They literally say that in the first couple scenes of the movie. Darth Vader literally plays his hand (get the pun?) against some admiral. As I said it's a mix of theocracy (that's literally who rules it and how it's ruled) and generic authoritarian.

> Also, whether North Korea, Russia, China and other 'generic authoritarian' countries fall into 'fascist' is certainly an area of open debate.

"Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/ FASH-iz-əm) is a far-right, authoritarian, and ultranationalist political ideology and movement,[1][2][3] characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation or race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy.[2][3] Opposed to anarchism, democracy, pluralism, egalitarianism, liberalism, socialism, and Marxism,[4][5] fascism is placed on the far right-wing within the traditional left–right spectrum.[6][5][7] 

Fits the Empire to a T.

Vader is kind of a rogue enforcer, but he is ordered around by Moff Tarkin and the decisions and discussion of actual governance is all moffs in that scene. The Emperor made a sweeping declaration to dismantle the imperial senate, appointed regional governors to direct control and then told Tarkin to go make it happen.

I’ll be wearing different masks and pointing out that I would go out of business if I tried to speak out in the open cause of how crazy this dude has turned all of my conservative customers against Democrats? I also plan to address that I am not advocating for Kamala or even a dem, but just reminding people of what they’re doing by voting for Trump. Any/all help super appreciated!

That's a guarantee. Trump bitched about 2016 being rigged before the first ballot was cast, and republicans have been taking that and running since 2018 at the latest. They've only added to their hate-filled toolchest.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEa3sK1iZxc

I'm reading Timothy Egan's *Fever in the Heartland* and it is terrifying how many parallels there are between the klan then and republicans now - from corrupting preachers without conscience to twist religious organizations from charity houses to propaganda mills, to veiling hate behind appeals to purity and a golden age which never existed.

I agree with your speculation that there will be LOTS of republicans running to be the next Trump, but at least I am pretty sure none of them will have the same level of brash, unashamed vitriol and ability to flip-flop on a dime since they'll be more desperate to hold onto the donors who own them.

"Saw a theory recently about Trump's specific malignant narcissism and how it differs from typical narcissism that centers around attention and approval. Trump appears instead to get his narcissistic supply from people being beat and broken. He needs to see people debasing themselves for him or being debased for/by him. Drawing a comparison with Jim Jones and how Jones watched his followers die before offing himself because seeing people throw their lives away for him was his supply. 

Epstein says as much in these tapes. That Trump only ever seeks to play people against each other and hurls insults and abuse toward people to get them to bend to his authority. It's the same thrust behind why so much of his cabinet are telling everyone to absolutely not support this person, and while we may never actually know for certain what happened to Johnson, knowing Trump as we do, it's not at all outside what he would do and instead tracks right along it.

I'm going to let you in on a brutal secret. Titillating material like this is a 2-edged sword. It is going to excite some unthinking people, and the are going to vote for the guy who served them some porn, and against the people who are against porn.

That's why the Access Hollywood tape was not all that damaging. The facts had faded from consciousness, but the tingle was still in the backs of people's lizard brains. Coupled with the naked pictures of Melania, I think material like this has a very muted effect.

"I think most people are woefully in willful denial of just how common incestuous abuse is in America and all countries. It’s not an Alabama thing like we cheeseily joke about: it’s every state. 

It’s horrendously common. 1 in 3-4 girls, and 1 in 5-6 boys will be sexually abused before they reach 18 and the vast majority of cases are perpetrated by family members. It’s statistically likely that Trump molested and/or raped Ivanka. 

We are happy to talk about abuses of clergy, of coaches, of teachers, to work ourselves up into justified rage over Epstein and Maxwell; but we all collectively ignore 95% of the problem, and more often than not keep the perpetrators in our own families safe.

>Here are some statistics that should be familiar to us all, but aren’t, either because they’re too mind-boggling to be absorbed easily, or because they’re not publicized enough. One in three-to-four girls, and one in five-to-seven boys are sexually abused before they turn 18, an overwhelming incidence of which happens within the family. These statistics are well known among industry professionals, who are often quick to add, “and this is a notoriously underreported crime.”

>Intentionally or not, children are protecting adults, many for their entire lives. Millions of Americans, of both sexes, choke down food at family dinners, year after year, while seated at the same table as the people who violated them. Mothers and other family members are often complicit, grown-ups playing pretend because they’re more invested in the preservation of the family (and, often, the family’s finances) than the psychological, emotional, and physical well-being of the abused.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

And I like this quote from Ann, I think it applies again to this election: 

> While she could share no secret recipe to an accurate poll, Selzer emphasized her ""polling forward"" methodology: focusing on the new data, rather than trying to force trends from previous election cycles or polls. 

> ""They think that what happened in the last election will be constant. And public opinion, by its very nature, is not constant,"" she said.

* Democrat Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump in Iowa 47% to 44%, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.
* A victory for Harris would be a shocking development after Iowa has swung aggressively to the right in recent elections, delivering Trump solid victories in 2016 and 2020.
* The poll shows that women — particularly those who are older or are politically independent — are driving the late shift toward Harris.
* Trump continues to lead with his core base of support: men, evangelicals, rural residents and those without a college degree.

Some background on why the Iowa Poll gets lots of attention: [From 'terrible' to golden, Ann Selzer and the Iowa Poll were proved right, again](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/04/iowa-poll-closely-matches-election-results-how-did-ann-selzer-do-it/6159615002)

For context, before Biden dropped out, Trump was up by 18-points in the same poll from June. Harris cut it to 4-points in their September poll. Today's is their final poll and she jumped another 7-points to +3. The Harris campaign probably would’ve been happy with Trump +4 again because they weren’t expecting her to win Iowa (Trump won Iowa in 2020 by 8-points). This is bananas and it's gonna be all over the news.

On more thing for Harris supporters: [Blue Voter Guide](https://bluevoterguide.org/) helps with YOUR specific ballot. It’s great for ballot propositions, as well as candidates without a (D) or (R) after their name (judges, commissioners, dog catcher).

Legitimately crazy, in the sense that it's like an exact mirror of the articles here, just reversed. Perceived mishaps of Harris. Foul language from Biden. Disgruntled Ex-Democrat speaking out (a NYT reporter...). A LANDSLIDE for Trump in sight.

Two Media bubbles that depict diametrically opposed realities. Nothing new, I know. But it's mindblowing to directly compare it days before the election",2024_11_03,05_39_46

I literally was saying this to a friend working as political director of a PAC a couple days after early voting started. Dems have maintained a doubled early voting margin and unaffiliated votes surpassed 2020 levels. I literally sent him my 270 map with oredictions from early voting and deep analytics on Oct 24. Iowa is going Harris. I also have Harris winning Texas as early voting levels in Texas are only 500k off from 2020 early voting when early voting was at its highest from COVID. Early voting turnout is still up post COVID but not 2020 levels because not many are doing mail ins. Also a lot will take advantage of paid tine off allowed to vote from workplaces again so turnout will be a lot higher on election day.,2024_11_03,05_39_46

Inflation - it’s 2.1% at the moment, right where the Fed wants it.  Biden omits is working.  Nobel pride winners say it will spike again if Trump wins. 

Jobs - Unemployment is low.  Wages are trending up. 

Climate (big in Iowa) - gets worse faster under Trump, and the storms, floods, and droughts will be more severe 

Abortion - duh

Health - Trump wants to take us back before the ACA.  Has no plan for a better system.  

Fascism - also duh. 

Labor - deport farm workers?  “What kind of an idiot would want that. We know these folks!”

Education 

Trade wars - “tariffs on everything?!?”  Didn’t we lose a bunch of hog and soybean markets the last time he did that?

Felony convictions!?!

National secrets to our enemies?

"Yeah it's kinda difficult to overstate how insanely bullish for Kamala this poll is. Selzer is arguably the best pollster in the COUNTRY, she's absolutely nailed Iowa in basically every recent election when no one else was close. (2018 governorship was her only miss, still within her margin of error tho)

The margin of error in this poll was 3.4, which doubles because you have to apply it to both candidates. That means in the absolute most pessimistically incorrect error, Trump has a 3.4% lead in Iowa. Iowa has been arguably the furthest right of the Midwest in recent years. If he squeaks out a 49%-46% win there, he almost certainly gets absolutely whomped in the Rust Belt, and is arguably at risk of losing Indiana and Ohio

"To be fair, the same pollster correctly forecast that Hillary was in serious trouble based on her polling in 2016 and showed that 2020 would be tight, slightly favoring Biden. Iowa tends to lean +8 towards the Republicans vs the national average. A Trump +3 in Iowa result from the same gold star pollster would be devastating news for Trump and indicate he would be losing the swing states. The result in this poll is Harris +3 and hints that other pollsters might have been weighting their polls incorrectly and missed some important trends, as happened in both 2016 and 2020 from other pollsters. The leading hunch I heard is that other pollsters are missing movements among non-college educated white women, particularly older white women 70+ towards Harris over Trump. When you look at Selzer’s granular data, older white women are breaking for Harris 2-to-1. That is a huge swing and is a fairly numerous group that is fairly dependable at showing up to the polls.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

Obama had won Iowa in both 2008 and 2012 and her having Hillary down by 9 points was shocking to people. It turns out Trump won the state by 8 points.

"Statistical uncertainty here does not go both ways. They are not independent variables. Moving one vote from one candidate to another directly affects the other’s votes. The 3.4% is +/- on *either* side not both. If you poll the outcome is 45:55 +/- 5 you obviously can’t have 55:60 or 40:50, it has to sum to 100.

There’s some slight technicality here in that this doesn’t add to 100 since people could vote neither, but it is still capped at 100 and they are still not independent variables. This is all taken into account already when the 3.4 number is reported as the uncertainty. However, uncertainty also isnt a guarantee it falls within that range. There’s a lot of factors that can could affect the accuracy but weren’t accounted for or it could just be a statistical outlier.

"You're right, this isn't early-vote counting, it's a true poll. It's also a much, much harder poll to write off than the others. Selzer has missed by more than 1% only TWICE since 2012. Once in 2016 when she had Trump +7 while he ended +9, once in 2018 when she had the governor ship 5% too blue.

No one else has had anywhere near this level of accuracy in the last decade. If she's even within her margin of error, it totally changes the complexion of the race in the Midwest.

">  I honestly did not see this coming at all, especially since it seems Iowa has been drifting away from Democrats in recent history.

Throw out all of our normal ideas about parties and candidates. Trump transcends Republican/Democrat enough that it's brand-new territory, even though this is his third time running. And Harris is transcending as well, e.g., losing support of Black men, gaining (some) support of white/Republican women. The whole thing is an election on psilocybin.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"Yeah if Iowa is actually drifting away from Trump like this suggests it's likely not even going to be close overall.

Assuming you have an '18 level error, Trump ends up with +2 in Iowa- down from +8 in 2020 and +10 in 2016. 

There is always of course the possibility that this is the one time Selzer gets it significantly wrong- but track record suggests not.

I am not a psychologist, but here's some food for thought:

It isn't necessarily homosexuality.  It could be a form of homoeroticism that is linked to his narcissistic personality, and issues with powerful men.  Amongst the plethora of mostly speculative psychological diagnoses of Trump is the idea that he craves respect and acceptance from other powerful men, a craving rooted in his relationship with his father (by all accounts, a sociopathic bully).  It could be that praising another man's sexual organs has something to do with acceptance in a group where power is everything. 

A more tangible example would be his choice of a mate.  Instead of picking someone with compatible interests, intelligence, education, or even someone age-appropriate, his choice could have more to do with picking a mate he thinks other men desire - whether he himself desires her or not is secondary.  His primary impulse, even in marriage, is to impress other men.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

> The results of the Roanoke College poll are consistent with an Oct. 7 poll by the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University that had Harris leading Trump by 11 points among Virginia likely voters.

Been some interesting articles on that recently. Speculation that pollsters are herding their results to mirror other pollsters so that they aren’t accused of being wrong. Basically everyone is saying it’s tied. The avalanche of GOP polls is muddying the waters as well. I suspect (hope?) that Harris is going to significantly outperform the polls. Trump is going to use all the garbage polls showing a statistical tie as evidence of voter fraud. We’ll know in a few days.,2024_11_03,05_39_46
I genuinely think pollsters know the actual results but fuck them up on purpose. They only have to be accurate a few days from the election because that's what they will be rated on.

> In our database as of this afternoon’s model run, there were 249 polls in the seven battleground states that met Silver Bulletin standards and did at least some of their fieldwork in October. How many of them showed the race in either direction within 2.5 percentage points, close enough that you could basically call it a tie?

> Well, 193 of them did, or 78 percent. That’s way more than you should get in theory — even if the candidates are actually exactly tied in all seven states, which they almost certainly aren't...

> All told, we’d expect 55 percent of the polls to show a result within 2.5 points in a tied race. Instead, almost 80 percent of them did. How unlikely is that?

> Based on a binomial distribution — which assumes that all polls are independent of one another, which theoretically they should be — it’s realllllllllllllly unlikely. Specifically, the odds are 1 in 9.5 trillion against at least this many polls showing such a close margin.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

Virginia votes in odd years which is a major disadvantage for the Dems. They don't often turn out on off-years and especially on odd-off years. Also, VA votes for governor the year after the presidential election, and almost always has a backlash against the new president's party.

Moreover, the Democrat was a historically bad candidate who made some huge gaffs, while the GOP cheated their primary voters and had a closed convention to nominate a mild mannered sweater-vest Republican (instead of the Trumpy lady who would have won the primary and lost the general). All this, and the Republican still only won by 2 points.

Also, Trump is running on a platform to gut the federal bureaucracy which is a huge part of Virginia's economy. It would be like running on the ""ban beef cattle"" platform in Texas.

Biden won by about 10, the governor before Biden won by 10, Senator Kaine (seeking reelection) won by 16 last time, and Hillary Clinton won by like 6... I'd expect another ~10-point win for Harris and probably 12-14 for Senator Kaine.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"Did you read my post? I’m not saying VA is a swing state or that its 13 electoral votes will matter nationally. Harris will win the state. I’m looking under the hood at two groups of voters that exist in VA which are critical demographics in Pennsylvania.

Conventional wisdom is that PA is the most likely tipping point state - Harris almost certainly can’t win without PA’s 19 EVs. And the conventional wisdom is that Harris needs great performance from college educated voters in the suburbs, and make sure Trump doesn’t meaningfully eat into the black voters in Philly and Pittsburgh. That’s her path in PA. It’s the path Biden took.

Virginia has a similar demographic setup to PA. You have the DC suburbs in Northern VA - which are attitudinally similar to Philly suburbs. And you have Hampton/Norfolk in the southeast which is attitudinally similar to Philly. If Harris performs poorly in the Northern VA suburbs and/or the black population centers in Tidewater VA, that could be an indication of future trouble in Pennsylvania.

Or, maybe VA does something completely independent of PA. That is possible. I don’t think it a likely, but it is possible.

So no, Virginia does not “literally” matter at all. But if you want something to watch early to see you can find an indicator for how Harris is doing with two keg voting blocs, the Northern VA suburbs and southeast VA urban counties are decent places to look.

Or you can just sit back and wait for those 7 swing states to come in themselves. Because those 7 will decide the election - and VA is not on that list.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

At least half a dozen European nations had gay marriage legalized before Obama came around to it.

Canada legalized gay marriage in 2005. 

There were Democrats against same sex marriage well into the 2010s.

You can’t possibly watch the video and really believe that. He even starts off by stroking the stand and then goes full on in for the money shot. He’s not even talking, just bobbing his head up and down with an open mouth. Don’t know how exactly that’s supposed to improve the sound quality. Edit- as pointed out, the mic isn’t even on the stand, he’s holding it off to the side. 


And his garbage audience knew **exactly** what he was doing. They went crazy laughing and applauding- because that’s really how they think a president should behave, I guess.

Honestly it’s a sign of advancing dementia - loss of regulation of urges like sexual impulses are common in elderly persons with dementia. And for someone like Trump who lashed out sexually when he was younger this makes it even worse. This can result in for example statements about sex or genitals in very inappropriate social situations (around grandchildren for example or in random conversations at say a restaurant — we had a relative who was in his 80s and losing it much more quickly than the family recognized and he got banned from a local grocery store after making comments to several cashiers (two females and one male as he would just blurt things out indiscriminately) he would haveNEVER made as a younger man) and/or touching/grabbing at other persons to express a sexual urge. Sadly it’s common in nursing homes etc. I’m not joking that I think Trump is definitely experiencing dementia (his devolution in the past year has been dramatic), and this sort of behavior goes along with the progress of the disease.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

 I asked if they could handle running the soundboard and they said, “what?”

So I shut it down, pulled the plug on the preachers main mic and the lectern, and left. I had a number of people be total pricks and bigots when I worked there and this was just my last straw. I heard from the pianist that evening that they couldn’t get it back on the rails and it ended right after communion. 

I still feel a little bad because the guest preacher and most of the people didn’t do anything wrong, but fuck those people in the choir and that whole executive council.

This is Trump’s “Grab them by the pussy.” tape. A presidential candidate discussing women by making obscene comments about them. Women, remember this when you vote this year.

Full transcript and video:

https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37595321

Unknown: “She used to be great, she’s still very beautiful.”

Trump: “I moved on her actually. You know she was down on Palm Beach. I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it. I did try and fuck her, she was married.”

Unknown: “That’s huge news there.”

Trump: “No, no, Nancy. No this was [inaudible] and I moved on her very heavily in fact I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture. I moved on her like a bitch. I couldn’t get there and she was married. Then all-of-a-sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s totally changed her look.”

Bush: “Your girl’s hot as shit. In the purple.”

Multiple voices: “Whoah. Yes. Whoah.”

Bush: “Yes. The Donald has scored. Whoah my man.”

Trump: “Look at you. You are a pussy.” 

Bush: “You gotta get the thumbs up.”

Trump: “Maybe it’s a different one.”

Bush: “It better not be the publicist. No, it’s, it’s her.”

Trump: “Yeah that’s her with the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful... I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.”

Bush: “Whatever you want.”

Trump: “Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”

Bush: “Yeah those legs. All I can see is the legs.”

Trump: “It looks good.”

Bush: “Come on shorty.”

Trump: “Oh nice legs huh.”

Bush: “Get out of the way honey. Oh that’s good legs. Go ahead.”

Trump: “It’s always good if you don’t fall out of the bus. Like Ford, Gerald Ford, remember?”

[As Mr Trump attempts to leave the vehicle he struggles with the door]

Bush: “Down below, pull the handle.”

[Mr Trump exits the bus and greets actress Arianne Zucker]

Trump: “Hello, how are you? Hi.”

Zucker: “Hi Mr Trump. How are you?”

Trump: “Nice seeing you. Terrific. Terrific. You know Billy Bush?”

Bush: “Hello nice to see you. How are you doing Arianne?”

Zucker: “I’m doing very well thank you. [Addressing Trump] Are you ready to be a soap star?”

Trump: “We’re ready. Let’s go. Make me a soap star.”

Bush: “How about a little hug for the Donald, he’s just off the bus?”

Zucker: “Would you like a little hug darling?”

Trump: “Absolutely. Melania said this was okay.”

Bush: “How about a little hug for the Bushy, I just got off the bus? Here we go, here we go. Excellent.”

[Mr Bush gesticulates towards Ms Zucker as he turns to Mr Trump]

Bush: “Well you’ve got a good co-star here.”

Trump: “Good. After you. Come on Billy, don’t be shy.”

Bush: “Soon as a beautiful woman shows up he just, he takes off. This always happens.”

Trump: “Get over here, Billy.”

Zucker: “I’m sorry, come here.”

Bush: “Let the little guy in there. Come on.”

Zucker: “Yeah, let the little guy in. How you feel now, better? I should actually be in the middle.”

Bush: “It’s hard to walk next to a guy like this.”

Zucker: “Wait. Hold on.”

[Ms Zucker changes position and walks between the two men]

Bush: “Yeah you get in the middle. There we go.”

Trump: “Good. That’s better.”

Zucker: “This is much better.”

Trump: “That’s better.”

Bush: “Now if you had to choose, honestly, between one of us. Me or the Donald, who would it be?”

Trump: “I don’t know, that’s tough competition.”

Zucker: “That’s some pressure right there.”

Bush: “Seriously, you had to take one of us as a date.”

Zucker: “I have to take the Fifth [Amendment of the US Constitution] on that one.”

Bush: “Really?”

Zucker: “Yep. I’ll take both.”

[They reach the end of the corridor]

Trump: “Which way?”

Zucker: “Make a right. Here we go.”

Bush: “Here he goes. I’m gonna leave you here. Give me my microphone.”

Trump: “Okay. Okay. Oh, you’re finished?”

Bush: “You’re my man. Yeah.”

Trump: “Oh. Good.”",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"My mother said the tape was “old” and that he’s actually a born again christian. This was in 2020. She’s become even more fervent despite all events since.

"Trump was unfit for office from the very beginning. That is important for young voters to know. It's also important for them to know that the only reason we still hear about Trump despite his litany of crimes and scandals is because the Republican Party chose to stand behind him through everything. If the Republicans had any moral compass, they would have rejected Trump around the time when he was proposing to outright ban one of the world's major religions from America back in 2015.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"I feel like one of the big problems with Trump is that people seem to only see/remember the last 5-10 bad things he has done or said, which distracts from the previous 90-95 bad things he has said prior to that.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"* **[Most young women expect words to be involved](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2013.792326?casa_token=EvcYyZ5wHMoAAAAA:dsFZmPGUwuWaYaxrVaBUH9bjVhBME7yrtlbanwrHGets8BlHVJ-RcDN0woR_ozbe4ruQexK0sItoDw) when their partner seeks their consent**. [43% of young men actually ask for verbal confirmation of consent](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/masculinity-survey/masculinity-survey.csv). Overall, verbal indicators of consent or nonconsent [are more common than nonverbal indicators](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919322). More open communication also [increases the likelihood of orgasm for women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5087699/).  

* [**Physical resistance is not required on the part of the victim to demonstrate lack of consent**](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape), [nor does the law require evidence of injury](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/R-v-Heard.php) in order for consent to be deemed absent. Women who try to physically resist rapes [are more likely to end up physically injured, while those who try to argue or reason with the offender are less likely to be injured](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1015254631767.pdf). The increased probability of injury [may be small, but the consequences serious](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24686123/).

* **[Consent](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Vermont&group=9) can be [legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=District%20of%20Columbia&group=9) communicated [verbally or nonverbally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Montana&group=9), and [must](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Minnesota&group=9) be [specific to engage in the sexual activity in question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_regarding_rape#Canada)**. Behaviors which don't meet the bar for communicating explicit consent for a particular sexual behavior (like [accepting an alcoholic beverage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29072826), [going to a date's room](https://prevent.richmond.edu/prevention/education/rape-myths.html), [kissing](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent), or [getting undressed](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0959353514539652)) are at best indicators of [likelihood for future consent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X17308571).

* [**Silence is not consent**](https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/sexual-assault-and-rape/sexual-assault). [Fighting, fleeing, and **freezing**](https://www.utoledo.edu/studentaffairs/counseling/anxietytoolbox/fightflightfreeze.html) are common fear responses, and thus not signs of consent. In fact, [most rape victims freeze in fear in response to unwanted sexual contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological), even though [most rapes are committed by someone known to the victim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape). 

* **Consent must happen *before* sexual contact is made**, or a violation has already occurred. [Legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=utah&group=9), sexual contact that takes a person [by surprise](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=New%20Hampshire&group=9) deprives them [of the opportunity](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Rhode%20Island&group=9) to [communicate nonconsent](https://www.rainn.org/laws-your-state-montana). There is [often a long period of uncertainty described in victim's rape accounts where she felt shocked by the rapist’s behavior and unsure of what was transpiring](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1471-6402.00030). In fact, [most unwanted fondling, and many rapes, occur because the victim didn't have time to stop it before it happened](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17202573/). Most victims also [become compliant during an assault, which is a protective behavior that does not signify consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological).

While that tape is blatantly disgusting, sexist, and quite telling of his own morality; He has said far worst shit that only incites his garbage cult followers (yeah i called them garbage, sue me) to commit violent crimes against actual people who have done nothing wrong to anybody. 

So im sorry if i may be the lone person here (havent read the comments) to say it, but that oompa loompa has made a lot of statements more shocking than that hollywood tape. Like idk, threatening to kill political rivals, his “stand back and stand by” comment, inciting a coup, stealing classified docs (top secret ones too), etc..

But hey if the younger side of Gen-Z finds that to be “shocking” then ooooh boy do i have news for them.

I doubt he has set foot in a church in decades since his only religion is the worship of himself, the church of donald.

One can only wish that others of my generation would open their eye and ears and see this person for what he truly is, a self entitled, daddy funded narcissist, and a conman who has no business sense ( see his 6 bankruptcies, two of which were casinos!!)

We're not shocked because to be shocked, you have to have not been paying attention (both-siders) or getting this for the first time (gen-z). We're not shocked because we've seen cults before and we know these people are in till the kool-aid's dry.

Gen Z is shocked by Trump’s Access Hollywood video. We should be, too.
Let’s not forget Trump’s decades of documented sexual misconduct.

Oct 30, 2024, 3:30 PM PDT

Constance Grady
Constance Grady is a senior correspondent on the Culture team for Vox, where since 2016 she has covered books, publishing, gender, celebrity analysis, and theater.
In 2016, when Donald Trump was first elected president, today’s 18-year-olds were only 10. So when footage leaked of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women in that year’s truly horrifying October surprise, they didn’t fully understand what the tape meant or know what to make of it, if they were even aware of it at all.

Now, Gen Z’s new voters are rediscovering the infamous Access Hollywood tape, with some hearing it in full for the first time. Young TikTokers are making videos reacting with somber faces to the audio of Trump’s tape, grimacing as he gets to the infamous line, “Grab ’em by the pussy.” The most popular one has nearly 1 million views.

“This is actually soooo crazyyy,” a commenter marvles on one such video. Another adds, “why is this not blown up more?!” Another: “I can’t even process this.” Dozens and dozens of them say: “Boost.” You can tell that the legions of new viewers and commenters think the tape is important and they want more people to see it, because it’s one of those Trump things the rest of us have mostly stopped talking about.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"Go VOTE then, for the love of god don’t stay home. This concerns your future Gen Z",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"As a gen z, we were shocked when it first came out.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"I was 17 when this shit came out, I was disgusted and was angered in 2016. Shit was disheartening right before I graduates high school, been voting since 2018. So don't count this young gen z (later hurt back GenZ now) out",2024_11_03,05_39_46
Welcome to the realization America has many morons who just need a bit of encouragement to be their true selves. Let’s end them.,2024_11_03,05_39_46

Where are the Epstien tapes?,2024_11_03,05_39_46
I just hate that the aftermath was whether he grabbed her by the pussy or not. He admits he tried to seduce a married woman and this was while his own wife was pregnant with his son.,2024_11_03,05_39_46
I was aghast when I first heard this.,2024_11_03,05_39_46
Genuinely don’t know how they didn’t know about this. This is one of his most famous quotes,2024_11_03,05_39_46
Just wait til they find out he killed their grandmothers and grandfathers.  With how he handled Covid back in 2020 with his stupidity.,2024_11_03,05_39_46
"Huh. I guess it didn't occur to me that some young voters are too young to really know about this. We should all make sure all young voters in our life have seen this video.

Edit: If you're an 18 year old first time voter today, then the Access Hollywood tape dropped when you were 10.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

It’s hilarious how people don’t realize that of course people have known who Trump was since the 1980s. We’ve seen him for decades and yet so many still voted for him. Why is it they continue to overlook these obvious political career killing mistakes?!?! It’s maddening…maddening I tell you!!,2024_11_03,05_39_46

"I was 13 in 2016, and remember when it first leaked. I lived in the rural deep south, Bible belt Arkansas, and my family were the only liberals we knew of at all in this community, and we watched everyone else, in real time, go from ""moderate Christian conservatives"" split between supporting Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio or John Kasich, to by October or November, the majority already being fervently MAGA. 

At age 13, hearing the tape on the news was just surreal to me, obviously by that age you hear vulgar disgusting stuff teenagers say, but this in specific felt so gross and wrong for anyone to say, and completely disqualifying for a candidate of ANY form of office. 

And when he won in November, I was just completely shocked, halfway in denial and still hoping he'd be more moderate in office and maybe I and others were just overreacting. 

By the end of his term, he did so much more damage than I at age 13 back in 2016 could have even grasped or imagined. And by 2020, I was one of the vast majority of Americans who were directly harmed and had our life endangered by his willful ignorance and outright treasonous mishandling of the pandemic, as I had become disabled and immunocompromised that same year (2020). 

Every new generation who is coming of age needs to hear about the Access Hollywood tape and to be aware of the worst things Trump has done, don't let conservatives white-wash it or pretend it wasn't so bad. It's disgusting that awful rhetoric like that even has to be heard in political discourse, but as many Americans as possible need to be aware of it, so that we not only win decisively on Tuesday, but so that we can stop the spread of the MAGA movement and it's rhetoric for good.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

Trump wants “kind of generals that Hitler had” according to his former Chief of Staff John Kelly. https://youtu.be/pttEmrXdVRc?si=QUjhb2XBZABKIwhQ, https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/politics/trump-said-hitler-did-some-good-things-and-wanted-generals-like-the-nazis-former-chief-of-staff-kelly-claims

The Nazis did not start with genocide.

First, they accused Jews and immigrants of stealing jobs from Germans. They claimed Jews were killing babies and drinking their blood. Sounds similar to Republican claims that immigrants are stealing jobs, Democrats kill babies, and immigrants eat cats and dogs.

Then, the Nazis called for physical violence against their political enemies and the Jews. I recall Trump telling his supporters in 2016 to beat up protestors at his rally, and that he would pay for their legal bills if they did. He also told law enforcement to not cover the heads of people pushed into police cars so that those people would hit their heads. This past month Trump called for a day of violence where police could beat up suspects. Sounds like the Nazi Kristallnacht.

Trump ordered ICE to separate immigrant families and keep them in concentration camps. To this day, some of the children have not been reunited with their families. Sounds similar to what the Nazis did to their “undesirables.”

Hitler told Germany that only he could save the Germans from the Jews and communists. Doesn’t Trump say that only he can save America from communists?

"[Mike Godwins](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/12/19/godwins-law-trump-hitler-00132427) thoughts on comparing Trump to Hitler / Nazis.

> “Trump’s opening himself up to the Hitler comparison."" ""You could say the ‘vermin’ remark or the ‘poisoning the blood’ remark, maybe one of them would be a coincidence, Godwin said. ""But both of them pretty much make it clear that there’s something thematic going on, and I can’t believe it’s accidental.”
>
> ""If you’re going to compare somebody to Hitler or the Nazis or raise the specter of the Holocaust, be sure you’ve got your facts right. But there’s nothing categorically wrong with Biden’s — or anyone else’s — comparison of Trump calling people vermin or talking about blood poisoning to Hitler."" 

>""I think that it would be fair to say that Trump knows what he’s doing. I think he chose that rhetoric on purpose. But yeah, there are some real similarities. If you’ve read Hitler’s own writing — which I don’t recommend to anyone, by the way — you see a dehumanizing dimension throughout, but the speeches are an even more interesting case.""

> ""What we have of Hitler’s speeches are mostly recorded, and they’re not always particularly coherent. What you see in efforts to compile his speeches are scholars trying to piece together what they sounded like. So, it’s a little bit like going to watch a standup comedian who’s hitting all of his great lines. You see again and again Hitler repeating himself. He’ll repeat the same lines or the same sentiment on different occasions.""

> ""With Trump, whatever else you might say about him, he knows what kinds of lines generate the kinds of reactions that he wants. The purpose of the rallies is to have applause lines, because that creates good media, that creates video. And if he repeats his lines again and again, it increases the likelihood that a particular line will be repeated in media reporting. So that’s right out of the playbook.""

> The question is why do it on purpose. Well, my opinion is that Trump believes, for whatever reason, that there is some part of his base that really wants to hear this message said that way, and he’s catering to them. He finds it both rewarding personally for himself and he believes it’s necessary to motivate people to help him get elected again.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"Agreed. It’s definitely morphed into something else, but the underlying racist core is still there. 

As far as fascism goes, the key characteristics are all there with Trump and MAGA supporters: 

- Ultra nationalist i.e. a hatred of immigrants and belief that the U.S. is for Americans, mainly white Americans 

- Disdain for human rights i.e. desire for mass deportation, rolling back rights for women

- Enemies, like libs, women, immigrants, etc.c serve as scapegoats 

- Belief media should be controlled, which shows how Trump invented the whole “fake news” slogan and him rolling out a lawsuit against CBS for the Kamala Harris “60 Minutes” interview, even though he was invited to participate 

- Obsession with national security and violent tactics to control citizens

- Religion and government become one 

- Corporate power is the supremacy, hence Elon Musk being lined up as the regulation czar to determine what businesses like his own should be required to do

- Fraudulent elections; while we know Trump cried fraud, we’re seeing him and his followers be the most active participants in trying to rig the election through downright cheating or trying to involved election officials 

There’s a lot more to it than all this and we could probably list out examples all night about how Trump’s brand of Republican is more in line with the Nazi Party than the historic Republican Party here in the U.S. It’s pretty wild. He’s absolutely a

> Neo-Nazi personality Nick Fuentes has ridiculed Donald Trump for dressing up as a garbage man, despite once being one of his most outspoken supporters and former dinner guests.

> In a rant on his channel, the white nationalist streamer said MAGA was indeed a cult—echoing sentiments others have already said about the blind obedience of Trump’s supporters.

> “At the Trump rallies, they’re yelling trash for Trump, trash for Trump. And I saw other people. I saw white guys. I saw Hispanic guys, Hispanic guys inside trash cans jumping out of them with Trump signs, white guys with garbage bags that say trash for Trump,” said Fuentes.

Apparently the Atlanta Journal Constitution says my county is a battleground. You wouldn't really know it other than from watching television. The tv ads are about evenly split between Trump and Harris. But in everything else about the campaign it seems to me that Harris is way ahead.

I don't think I've gotten a mailer from Trump in a month. I have about six from the Harris campaign.

I've also had four people from the Harris campaign canvassing door to door in person, and multiple phone calls. That's compared to zero for Trump on both.

There are a few Trump signs out there on the side of the road, but I've seen more for Harris.

In the last month I've seen one bumper sticker for Harris and none for Trump. Imho it's telling that the cars with the ""thin blue line"" American flag *don't* have Trump stickers. I know they're still going to vote for him anyway, but I think it speaks volumes that they're not publicly supporting him with stickers anymore.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"I remember hearing about or reading news stories about women who would get a back alley or dirty hotel room abortion only to die in the ally or on the street. Stories about women who tried to self abort with a metal hanger. The depiction of metal wire hangers happened for good reasons, too many women died or did so much damage to their reproductive organs that they could never have children.

We have already seen too many women in Texas be denied a medically necessary abortion which would not just save their lives but would allow them to have the additional child/children they want. We have seen at least 2 women from Georgia and one (or more) in Texas die due to the way the laws have been written as to be so evasive that doctors fear for their careers and livelihood not to mention the health of their patients.

Of course women of my age and older remember what happened prior to Roe v. Wade. We were the ones celebrating our victory in 1973. May of us were on the protest lines again, we were the ones with the signs indicating our need to protest again to keep our right to self determination. We did not have nice things to say about the SCOTUS decision overturning Roe v. Wade. We will not forget what the Trump SCOTUS did nor will we forgive.

Yes, it's harder to get that sort of person to win the primary. That's a problem with the primary system - it encourages selecting candidates that will have a hard time winning the general election. The Republicans have been suffering from this issue as well, and I'm not sure of a good way to address it other than encouraging primary voters to vote more strategically or changing the voting system significantly.

The heart breaking this is if they got onboard with ample public funding for birth control and intelligent sex education and easy access to early abortion meds and procedures, and free maternal care and scans to pick up any developing problems, there would be a lot less mid to late term abortions.

"This is the party of small government asking for regulating women’s bodies. 

This is the same party that lost its shit for 2+ years because people were asked to please wear a mask to prevent spread of a new novel virus and they characterized it as a government takeover. Yet, they’re absolutely fine with regulating women’s bodies because they consider it “murder” because some religious text that they’ve never read, they believe doesn’t authorize it. 

Well guess what, follow your book of mysticism and leave me the fuck alone. Your religious beliefs end at your decision making. How the fuck would they feel if we passed legislation based on other religious texts? I’m sure I can guess. By the way, the Torah I believe doesn’t forbid abortion, so why should a young Jewish-American girl have to abide by this bullshit religious based legislation.

Even killing newborns wasn’t illegal in the time of Jesus and you’d think that would be a big deal but it doesn’t come up. I totally agree with you. My only point, which you didn’t seem to read, is that if someone truly believes actual healthy babies are being murdered then being upset about it isn’t weird. There are a lot of nice Christian people out there in red states, not very well educated, go to church and are surrounded by people who also go to church and they aren’t the GOP machine, they are just genuinely upset about what they think is happening. What they are being told is happening. I don’t think they are bad people, they are just ignorant and being lied to and kept dumb. They are being used to make something really bad happen to women, and it’s just going to get worse and worse if Trump gets in, soon followed by Vance and whatever sick rich misogynist fucks are pulling their strings.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"Trump actually raised middle class taxes taking effect after Biden took office, while keeping rich taxes low.

His Lumber tariffs started the rise in housing prices… PRECOVID!

He Made a 2 year deal with OPEC Aka Putin and Prince bonesaw, to artificially raise inflate gas prices for US oil industry execs (who also took Covid relief funds), then the 2 year long inflated prices STARTED inflation AFTER Covid because… THE KEY here being King Cheeto the “master of deal making” got taken for a ride… because….  it was not necessary in the first place, and… way too long as a 2 YEAR DEAL!!

Biden had to beg OPEC to turn the taps off before the deal ended and they basically said sorry, your orange clown signed on the line that is dotted. 

The day the deal ended prices started going down and so did inflation! 

There are charts that show an exact correlation, look it up. 

After he lost the election, butt hurt and knowing it would be time bomb in Biden’s lap, he emptied Afghanistan prisons full of Taliban, then withdrew all but a skeleton crew of our troops, leaving Biden no choice but to get the rest of our troops out ASAP for their own security.

Trump is and was a fucking disaster, takes credit for Obama’s economy, fucked it all up, and blames Biden for everything he caused.

It isn't your local politician. It isn't your presidential candidate, It isn't any political party. It is greed on the part of big business.

It has long been proven that if you leave businesses to their own devices, they'll absolutely 'shaft' the consumer and have no compunction about it. That is what businesses have done. They did it because there is currently no law or governing entity which oversees rate of price increases. I don't believe the average American has an issue with reasonable price hikes on products. They know and have come to except price increase on products and services. It is the RATE at which those prices have increased which alarm people.

And if Trump wins, they will truly believe they are better off economically, based on flimsy anecdotes or no explanation at all.

ETA: The sharp increase in prices in this particular moment in time is a consequence of deregulation, yes, but also of inflation from the pandemic relief they printed all that money for, and the fact that most of the recovery in the years that followed (96%, I read somewhere once) was slurped up by the ultra-rich.   
I certainly don't have the economic expertise to say that the Trump and Biden administrations printed the right or wrong amount of money, but I think that any administration would have printed some large amount, because inflation is superior to the counterfactual scenario of total economic collapse due to the pandemic.

"For those wondering about what really happen and how this conspiracy originated:

The belief that vaccines might cause autism can be traced back to a now-discredited study published in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield, a former British physician. Wakefield and 12 co-authors published a paper in The Lancet that suggested a potential link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. The study claimed that 12 children who received the MMR vaccine showed developmental regression and gastrointestinal issues. This controversial claim generated widespread public concern and spurred significant media attention, fueling fears about the safety of vaccines.

However, the study was quickly scrutinized for its flaws. First, it was based on an extremely small sample size of just 12 children, which was statistically inadequate to draw reliable conclusions. The study also lacked control groups, a fundamental aspect of rigorous scientific research. Further investigations revealed even more troubling details: Wakefield had undisclosed conflicts of interest, including being funded by lawyers pursuing lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers. Additionally, he had filed a patent for a separate vaccine, raising questions about his motives in discrediting the MMR vaccine.

Subsequent independent investigations were conducted to verify the claims made in the 1998 paper. Large-scale studies consistently found no link between vaccines and autism. For instance, a major cohort study conducted in Denmark, involving over 500,000 children, showed that the MMR vaccine did not increase the risk of autism. Other studies conducted by prominent health organizations, including the CDC and the WHO, reaffirmed these findings, establishing that vaccines do not cause autism.

The repercussions for Wakefield were severe. In 2010, The Lancet formally retracted the 1998 paper, citing ethical violations and false information. The GMC in the UK conducted an extensive investigation, concluding that Wakefield had engaged in professional misconduct, including dishonesty and the unethical treatment of children. As a result, Wakefield’s medical license was revoked, effectively barring him from practicing medicine in the UK. He was widely discredited in the scientific community and faced significant public criticism for promoting misleading information that contributed to widespread vaccine hesitancy.

This discredited study had lasting consequences, sparking a wave of vaccine fear that persists in some communities today. Public health experts have continued to emphasize that the original claims were fraudulent and that comprehensive research has shown vaccines to be safe and unrelated to autism. Despite the overwhelming evidence, the legacy of Wakefield’s disinformation has underscored the importance of maintaining trust in scientific rigor and ensuring that conflicts of interest are transparent in medical research.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"I’m wary of going too far down that path on an individual speech level, though I share the grave concern about the potential impacts of misinformation on this front. There is sufficient time for debate in the vast majority of situations and the evidence is overwhelming though, so it isn’t quite the same as the theater test in some ways that matter.

That said, we can’t sit on our hands and do nothing. We’re not indifferent to the consequences of rampant ignorance. To address that, I’d personally rather increase legal liability for those that spread the misinformation through commercial channels.

"I dispute none of what you wrote. I don't remember the details of Wakefield's fraud, only that it was fraud from the start.

[The British Medical Journal](https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452):
>The Office of Research Integrity in the United States defines fraud as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism. [Journalist Brian] Deer unearthed clear evidence of falsification. He found that not one of the 12 cases reported in the 1998 Lancet paper was free of misrepresentation or undisclosed alteration, and that in no single case could the medical records be fully reconciled with the descriptions, diagnoses, or histories published in the journal.

>Who perpetrated this fraud? There is no doubt that it was Wakefield. Is it possible that he was wrong, but not dishonest: that he was so incompetent that he was unable to fairly describe the project, or to report even one of the 12 children’s cases accurately? No. A great deal of thought and effort must have gone into drafting the paper to achieve the results he wanted: the discrepancies all led in one direction; misreporting was gross. Moreover, although the scale of the [UK General Medical Council's] 217 day hearing precluded additional charges focused directly on the fraud, the panel found him guilty of dishonesty concerning the study’s admissions criteria, its funding by the Legal Aid Board, and his statements about it afterwards.

Edit: A better summary paragraph, *ibid*.
>[J]ournalist Brian Deer now shows the extent of Wakefield’s fraud and how it was perpetrated (doi:10.1136/bmj.c5347). Drawing on interviews, documents, and data made public at the GMC hearings, Deer shows how Wakefield altered numerous facts about the patients’ medical histories in order to support his claim to have identified a new syndrome; how his institution, the Royal Free Hospital and Medical School in London, supported him as he sought to exploit the ensuing MMR scare for financial gain; and how key players failed to investigate thoroughly in the public interest when Deer first raised his concerns.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

*If* something happens, there's such a precise trail that they almost certainly know when something went wrong and who fucked up.

The awareness of this at every step, plus the general lack of desire to get in trouble or face a consequence, means things just usually don't.

Which makes sense, because why do it?

My folks, who are otherwise intelligent people, said they say 'undeniable proof of mystery magic boxes being counted to boost Dem totals in the middle of the night.'

I mentioned hearing that certain states had rules that said they couldn't count mail-ins until the polls closed, so 
 while I kept an open mind about concerns of fraud, I was at least less concerned about that specific one since it seems verifiable and plausible.

They said they saw someone say that wasn't true.

They also said Kamala is a whore who whored her way to get where she got. I pointed out she was elected, and that she must be *amazing* in bed and I am just as impressed with her if she fucked everyone in the state so well that they voted for her, and they said they understood that she got elected but ""most of the stuff that wasn't elected she fucked for.""

You know, because they were there in the room I guess?

What's wild is if my sister were to come to her and say, ""Someone said I slept my way to get to my job"", she'd talk for at least ten minutes about how hard it is to be a woman and how much they are persecuted. And despite 85% of every guy ever manwhoring (including the person they're voting for), this one specific person gets accused and now it's a problem. The supposed lovers of civic duty denigrate someone who has only ever took jobs to help people out.

I am sure she's just as human as the rest of us and I for-sure disagree with a lot of what she says and how she handles herself. But she's not an idiot or evil. Not even close.

Thanks for the tip, I'll watch it after the election. 

>Even the democratic party of the time ignored county votes to nominate Hillary in states that had chosen Bernie Sanders unequivocally.

I don't know what incident you are referencing even though I wouldn't have called the 2016 Democratic primary fair regardless, but it really is an apples and oranges comparison between how a private organization like the DNC or RNC runs and operates a primary and how a general election works. It's not evidence of anything when it comes to an actual general election, and the post title is still completely accurate.

> Harris was also “chosen”, not “voted for”. 

Harris was nominated the same way that every other DNC candidate was nominated, by a bunch of delegates getting together and voting for her at a designated time and place so that the nominee's name will be on the ballot for all fifty states. No Democrat challenged her, nobody was interested in challenging her, and if hypothetically they did challenge her they would have lost that challenge and Harris would still be the nominee right now, whether through delegate count or even if they had time or the rules in place for a second primary (which the DNC didn't).

Ultimately this is election is the easiest decision in the history of decisions. Do you want a senile rapist narcissistic Hitler-loving felon in the While House or Kamala Harris? Who do you think Michael Moore is going to vote for? 

And for the record I still have my Bernie Sanders shirt I bought in 2016, and supported him in the last two elections. But when I came down to it I still voted for Hillary in the general election just as I already voted for Harris this election. The only person at fault for the unusual circumstances of Harris nomination is Joe Biden, but if he didn't do what he did then Biden would be a nominee that 2/3rds of Democrats didn't want as the nominee despite primary results. He saw the bad options laid out before him and took the least worst one. If Americans are capable of making a much easier choice then this election won't even be close. We will see.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

It's a colossal task for your local auditor's office, especially for these last 2 elections in particular, but 100% of the poll workers I've ever worked with want nothing more than for your vote to count the same as everyone else's does, and we all care immensely that it happens.

I mean his Trump bibles are made in China so….at least he’s consistent?,2024_11_03,05_39_46
"Article:

On the campaign trail, Donald Trump threatened businesses that send jobs south of the border, while his own company that runs the Truth Social platform outsourced coding jobs to workers in Mexico, outraging some staff members. 

Former President Donald Trump’s social media company outsourced jobs to workers in Mexico even as Trump publicly railed against outsourcing on the campaign trail and threatened heavy tariffs on companies that send jobs south of the border.

The firm’s use of workers in Mexico was confirmed by a spokesperson for Trump Media, which operates the Truth Social platform. The workers were hired through another entity to code and perform other technical duties, according to a person with knowledge of Trump Media. The reliance on foreign labor was met with outrage among the company's own staff, who accused its leadership of betraying their “America First” ideals, the person said.

The outsourcing to Mexico helped prompt a recent whistleblower letter from staff to Trump Media’s board that has been roiling the company.

That complaint, reported by ProPublica last month, calls for the board to fire CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman. The letter alleges he has “severely” mismanaged the company. It also asserts the company is hiring “America Last” — with Nunes imposing a directive to hire only foreign contractors at the expense of “American workers who are deeply committed to our mission.”

“This approach not only contradicts the America First principles we stand for but also raises concerns about the quality, dedication, and alignment of our workforce with our core values,” the complaint reads.

A Trump Media spokesperson said the company uses “two individual workers” in Mexico. “Presenting the fact that [Trump Media] works with precisely two specialist contractors in Mexico as some sort of sensational scandal is just the latest in a long line of defamatory conspiracy theories invented by the serial fabricators at ProPublica,” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson declined to answer other questions about the company’s Mexican contractors, including how much they’ve been paid, how many have been used over time and how their hiring squares with Trump’s promises to punish firms that send jobs outside of the U.S. The Trump campaign did not respond to questions.

For a company of its prominence, Trump Media has a tiny permanent staff, employing just a few dozen people as of the end of last year, only a portion of whom work on the Truth Social technology.

Trump Media’s hiring of Mexican coders also prompted frustration within the staff, the person with knowledge of the company said, because they were perceived by staff to not have the technical expertise to do the work.

On its homepage, Truth Social bills itself as “Proudly made in the United States of America. 🇺🇸”

Both as president and in his campaign for a second term, Trump has criticized companies that send jobs abroad, particularly to Mexico. If elected, he has pledged to “stop outsourcing” and “punish” companies that send jobs abroad.

For example, Trump recently threatened agricultural machinery giant John Deere with tariffs if it went through with plans to move some of its manufacturing to Mexico.

“I’m just notifying John Deere right now, if you do that, we’re putting a 200 percent tariff on everything you want to sell into the United States,” Trump said.

He has made a similar threat against automakers building cars in Mexico, demanding they hire American workers and manufacture domestically. 

“I'm not going to let them build a factory right across the border,” Trump promised, “and sell millions of cars into the United States and destroy Detroit further.""

Trump owns nearly 60% of the social media company, a stake worth around $3.5 billion at the stock’s Friday closing price — more than half of the former president’s net worth.

The results of the election are widely seen as a major factor in the future value of the company. As the Nov. 5 election draws closer, Trump Media’s stock price has fluctuated wildly even as little or nothing has changed in the company’s actual business, which generates scant revenue. The stock closed Friday down 40% from its recent peak on Tuesday. Despite that drop, it has still nearly doubled since the beginning of October.

One Trump Media board member, Eric Swider, offered a defense of relying on foreign labor in a statement to ProPublica from his lawyer.

“President Trump maintains an America First policy, which includes prioritizing American workers. Trump Media, however, is a global multi-media company. For a global multi-media company to utilize subcontractors, which in turn may utilize coders located in a foreign country, is a practice common to the industry,” the statement said. “Such global multi-media companies like Trump Media would have no right to control the employment decisions of its subcontractors, which may employ workers in a multitude of different countries in addition to the United States.”

Swider, a businessman based in Puerto Rico, serves on the board alongside better known figures such as Donald Trump Jr. and Linda McMahon, the former Trump cabinet member who is now co-chair of his transition team.

The outsourcing to Mexico is not the only instance of Trump Media relying on foreign workers. ProPublica previously reported that the company used a foreign firm to source labor in the Balkans.

Nunes, for his part, is quoted in a new book about Truth Social, “Disappearing the President,” boasting about his ability to keep costs down at Trump Media, though he didn’t mention outsourcing.

“Nobody grew as fast as we did. I don't think there's any other example even close to us out there, especially with as little money as we spent,” Nunes said. “Don't forget that. We built this for a fraction of what these other companies were built for.”",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"I worked at a year-round Christmas decoration/ornament/etc. store during Trump's first real run for President for 2016.

Anyway, the reason I bring this up is because the boxes that these ornaments came in states (in very thick, bold lettering) ""Make America Great Again"" **right next to much smaller font that says ""made in China"".**

So there's a family in the store browsing and whatnot. I mean they were super friendly and caused absolutely no issues or anything so I was chill with em, but I did note something absolutely asinine that the father said about the Trump ornaments:

""HAH! damn right Make America Great Again"", he said to his family all in tow. *I didn't even jump in whatsoever on the conversation and the dad* ***then*** says (after seeing ""made in China"" for the first time on the lanyard part):

"Based on January 6 and Trump priming the pumps again for a “stolen election”, my guess is Trump will claim victory the evening of November 5, his supporters will celebrate, and then when it is announced a few days later that Harris won, all hell will break loose.

Remember, in 2020, it took four to five days for the election results to finalize.  This is due to election laws in a few states including, for example, Pennsylvania, one of the most important battleground states.  Pennsylvania does not allow election workers to begin processing mail ballots until Election Day, which means it will likely take several days before the results are known. Their Governor pushed for changes that would have allowed for ballots to be processed early. But Republicans, who control the Senate, failed to advance that. So in 2024, it will again take several days to finalize results.

Just as in 2020, be prepared for Trump to stoke anger again about “voter fraud” and spread conspiracy theories because a few battleground states will take a few days to finalize their results.

It’s my understanding Democrats have put attorney Marc Elias in charge of postelection litigation, with hundreds of lawyers and thousands of volunteers, to fight what is expected to be an aggressive Republican effort to challenge the results of the 2024 election.

Yup! Everybody and their mothers knows that.,2024_11_03,05_39_46
Thanks for stating the obvious. This guy is still voting a straight R ticket.  Trying to revise history to be that somehow he’s one of the good ones.

What was your first hint? The first two times he claimed there was cheating? The time he refused to concede? The time he said he wouldn’t concede this election unless it was clean and claimed he couldn’t lose unless there was cheating? Or the fact he’s already accusing dems of cheating in this election with basically no evidence.,2024_11_03,05_39_46

Trump is shouting that he is leading in the polls without any evidence that this is so. . When Trump loses he will scream that he was winning so ELECTION FRAUD. . This will give MAGA the permission to bring down Trump’s American Kristallnacht of violence and chaos and blood,2024_11_03,05_39_46

States will try and withhold their EC votes and force a House election, or get it thrown to the Supreme Court. It will be chaos and anarchy, a huge Constitutional crisis that will not go well.

People like GW Bush, Pence, Romney, etc.

Could that be a pipe dream? Yes. But it could also be why none of them have explicitly endorsed her. If they are holding back for that particular reason, it makes more sense but they also wouldn't be able to say it before the election.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"I’m actually curious if someone has made a roster of sorts to keep tabs on these people, especially considering some of them got months and not years. Obviously, there are some who got multiple years but a lot of the rabble did not. Someone tried and convicted in 2022 for 1/6 is more than likely back on the streets than they are to still be in jail, for example. An actual good use of face recognition or open source intelligence would be to compare those charged for 1/6 against anyone who might want to show up for round 2. 

They’ve shown they have no respect for the law and are not grateful for getting basically no real jail time and a few years of probation (in a lot of cases). Any one of them caught the second time around need to get real sentences, measured in years and not months. 

It’s mind boggling to think that the same people who were convicted are actually stupid enough to try it again, considering Trump failed to pardon them or pay their legal fees like they thought he would. I really, really hope anyone found to be participating in Treason: Part 2 is hammered by the legal system this time around and we don’t keep the kid gloves on for the sake of “healing the nation” or “moving on from the past”. We made that mistake during Reconstruction and cannot afford to do it again. 

The only way to move forward after the threat of Trump is to firmly snuff out what’s left of his seditious movement.

This scattering effect, called Rayleigh scattering, causes us to see the sky as blue when we look in any direction away from the sun.

It's still insignificant but they are ones more likely to do it.  Mainly because they aren't the smartest bunch and don't understand how little a double vote does while the risk is that of a felony.  It's so stupid to risk everything for one extra vote.,2024_11_03,05_39_46

"""Barely a hurdle"" is still ""a hurdle""

Think of it like this... how many people fill out their ballot and say ""ah shit, I need a witness... I'll just get X to witness when they get home"" and then something happens (set the ballot somewhere dumb, forget, X comes home late... whatever) - the fact that this is definitely a non-zero number is problematic.

Same thing with these stupid ""the ballot is not legit because the date is wrong"" rules. Grandma accidentally writes 1924 on the ballot... or switches day and month... or doesn't put the year...
WHY THE FUCK DO YOU NEED A DATE ON A BALLOT ENVELOPE THAT SHOWS UP WITHIN THE VOTING DATE WINDOW ?!?!? 

Back to the original issue - they match a signature anyway. What does the witness signature achieve?

As a social researcher I know the following is certain:

* every single additional thing you add to a data collection process (like voting or filling out a survey) creates an opportunity for attrition.

"That’s a good quote, and especially relevant in the last two weeks.   People that spent the last 3 1/2 years being dimly aware of what is going on politically are firing up their search engines to do a little research before voting.

That first quick search is probably leading them all to the massive trove of negative information about Trump. It’s not only negative, but incredibly negative, and on every axis.  

Inflation - it’s 2.1% at the moment, right where the Fed wants it.  Biden omits is working.  Nobel pride winners say it will spike again if Trump wins. 

Jobs - Unemployment is low.  Wages are trending up. 

Climate (big in Iowa) - gets worse faster under Trump, and the storms, floods, and droughts will be more severe 

Abortion - duh

Health - Trump wants to take us back before the ACA.  Has no plan for a better system.  

Fascism - also duh. 

Labor - deport farm workers?  “What kind of an idiot would want that. We know these folks!”

Education 

Trade wars - “tariffs on everything?!?”  Didn’t we lose a bunch of hog and soybean markets the last time he did that?

Felony convictions!?!

National secrets to our enemies? 

Miming blow jobs in front of kids?  Dressing up as garbage to “own the libs?” The recruiting arm of Epstein’s teen operation?  More makeup than Dolly Pardon?  Order the regular Army to fight US citizens? Write off the island of Puerto Rico as nothing but trash?

The list just goes on and on.  At some point, probably 2 in the morning after 5 hours of surprising internet surfing even the regular Fox viewers will conclude they have to vote for Harris.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"He will.

But litigating in 5+ states and trying to argue that they *all* had issues that just happened to cause you to lose (but someone the states he wins didn't have those same issues) becomes a lot harden.

I've commented a few times on it, but I suspect he's been campaigning in NC today because he pretty much needs to win it to be able to litigate in the fewest states possible (especially PA, if he loses it). Losing NC essentially would mean that he needs to overturn results in multiple states to ""win"".",2024_11_03,05_39_46
That's true and I'd love nothing more than a blue executive and legislative branch. But getting Trump out of politics is my number one priority.

"Personally I think so too, but r/Georgia is very divided about this. Of course none of us know much aside from anecdotes and vibes — presence or absence of yard signs and so on. I went to one of Harris’ rallies and it was a capacity crowd with great energy. Trump rallied here afterward and the venue his campaign booked was about a quarter of the size. That doesn’t necessarily equate to how the vote will turn out, of course, but I think it’s encouraging in that it shows great enthusiasm.

In any event, early voting turnout has been awesome, and so far women have outvoted men by a lot.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"Small point but reading between the lines here it's kind of not fair to separate ""points off"" and ""missing"".

"It also means that a state legislature is unlikely to decide to risk it all sending a slate of fake electors when it won't make a difference.

That's a genuine concern for January.

If five states need to pull bullshit, there's a good chance that one of them will have a blue legislature and say hell no.  Even if they are all red, they might be thinking ""If anyone defects we're fucked.""",2024_11_03,05_39_46

Cool. Thank you! I used to live in GA and I’m curious to see how this plays out.,2024_11_03,05_39_46
"Possibly, but it could also just indicate a polling error going in Harris’ favor across the board.

"> and she's even leading heavily in the senior vote. 

When you think about it, this makes perfect sense. Unlike Hitler and the Holocaust, there's still a massive generation of Americans who are old enough to remember what America like was like *before* Roe v Wade.

Also early voting returns. Ignoring the party affiliation it's showing women voting far more than men and bith parties voting early. His day of voting support is being cannibalized and in states that matter if you assume all democrats vote for Harris and ~10% of Republican women vote for her he'd need a massive win on day of to overtake her lead. But once again that only comes to fruition if everyone gets out and votes.,2024_11_03,05_39_46
"Don't forget, the left was complacent and lazy AF during 2016, partially because nobody thought Trump could win.

"> Someone please try to lie to me to make sense of this.

Think of it this way: You live in a city covered by a glass dome that makes the sky look green. Everyone you know lives in the city. All your news and other media is based in that city. So EVERYONE knows the sky looks green. Occasionally some weirdo or news source on the internet says the sky is blue but come on? You and everyone around you *clearly* know the sky is green. The news you get all your traffic reports and local news from not only say the sky is green, but the other news channels are *lying* to you. That they want to trick you into believing the sky is blue.

One day, the dome breaks and you can clearly see the blue sky for the first time in your life. Which do you think is more likely to happen? That you and everyone you know were **wrong** your entire life? Nope. You're more likely to deny what you're seeing: Maybe your eyes are playing tricks on you, or maybe the *sky broke*. Either way, within a few days the sky is back to normal and you pass off what you saw as a trick or hallucination.

That's basically how *all* people function: They're more likely to disbelieve a new truth than accept they've been lied to or tricked.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

> who are you going to vote for? Harris? There's literally no other choice but Trump.  
  
And you show how they do it here. The way you phrased this sentence, hell, the way you framed your entire comment, you make it seem as if Trump is the default choice for the entire electorate, and you imply that Trump will automatically get every single vote and that Democrats can only win by taking voters away from Trump.  
  
Why is Trump the default choice? 
  
You give an even better example here:  
  
> Obama did a lot of drone strikes and torture continued at Gitmo during his terms, so even as good as he was, he was a lesser evil, not a greater good.  
  
This is the typical ‘Obama was not literally perfection, therefore lets vote for the convicted felon conman who bankrupts his companies, who is a rapist, and who consorts with state enemies **while also conducting tons of drone strikes like Obama** (except Trump changed policy to stop reporting on drone strikes because if the public doesn’t know about it, that means its okay, right?).’  
  
You ironically fall for the same trap that OP is trying to figure out by basing your entire comment on the premise that the issue is with the Democrats and noone else.  
  
Its the media and social media, which push divisive and damaging political messaging onto **everyone**.  Its literally unavoidable by this point, and until someone does something to rein this in, future election cycles will only get worse. It does not matter what Democrats do internally about their ‘messaging’ or policies. In fact  that is quite literally irrelevant. There is no magical ‘correct’ set of policies that will somehow allow Democrats to win elections.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"Yeah, I would have snagged his Passport, but fleeing would be the same as admitting he lost.

Also, I'm no sure it's that easy to ditch his Secret Service team.  My understanding is an ex-president can request they no longer get protection, but doing that right after losing an election would raise a bunch of red flags.

Planes flying international also need to fly a flight plan, and ever since 9/11, if you deviate from that - expect to be intercepted by something fast and armed.  If it was carrying an ex-President, I'd expect this to be doubly true.

Finally, it would depend where he tried to go.  I'm not sure he has access to a plane that could make it to Russia or China in one shot, which really leaves something like Venezuela.

Anything less than that will suggest, in the future, that so long as you have *enough* power, the suggested legal response would then always just be: ""let them be free completely while they see their influence dip"".

Justice isn't supposed to factor in any of that, **at all**, into deciding who gets punished to what degree.  If that were how things were supposed to go, then the only cost (in the end) for anyone at all wanting to repeat what Trump did, would be ""you won't go to jail, but society is going to hold you *socially* accountable because you suck so much"".

"Reminds me of [an article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-anxiety-disorder-mental-health-political-divide-us-1.4762487) about anxiety in the age of Trump way back in 2018. A WH staffer's marriage crumbled:

> Washington therapist Steve Stosny recounted how an official with the Trump administration came to see him not long ago. At work, the official explained, he felt anxious about his high-pressure job in a highly scrutinized White House. At home, he faced a more personal turmoil: his liberal-leaning family grew to resent him for working for Trump.

>""His daughter was starting to hate him,"" Stosny said. ""It was very hard on his spouse, too. The wife couldn't take it anymore. It's tough when one spouse is at war with the children.""

> The patient eventually left his job, but the damage was already done. The couple began divorce proceedings, Stosny said.

It's deeply sad but how does one reconcile ""I love you"" with ""you are actively helping destroy the country, daily""?",2024_11_03,05_39_46

That doesn't fully answer your questions, though, about what was going on in their marriage during Trump's first term while they were still married but George had turned against Trump 

George Conway seems to have been on board with Trump until after he was elected, and George accepted a senior position in Trump's Department of Justice but, George has said, he pulled out at the last minute when the ongoing ""shit show"" of the early Trump administration and the moral awfulness of Trump somehow really sunk in for George and he realized he couldn't continue to be associated with and work for a man like that. As for why that happened for him then and not much earlier, I don't know.

What he says is important, but understand that it is designed to suck the oxygen out of the room. We can't talk calmly about important issues because there's always something to be outraged that seems to take priority. He wants everyone to talk about him and he is succeeding.

Trump has hijacked the national discourse.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

He clearly slipped into the mental subroutine where he orders his political enemies to be executed. They call it “the weave”.,2024_11_03,05_39_46
He quite literally shared posts on truth social saying she deserved a military tribunal and firing squad only a few months ago. How is it that he always manages to say things in the worst way. Like every time. He's either purposefully doing it or a freaking moron,2024_11_03,05_39_46
[removed],2024_11_03,05_39_46
"This is a man who has declared previously that Liz and others should face a televised mi;litary tribunal for treason (Carrying the death penalty). Who has stated that he wants to bring back banned methods of execution like the firing squad, including sending a bullet to the family of the executed and making them pay for the cost of the bullet. These are quotes directly from his mouth.

A man who riled up his supporters, told them to fight like hell and march to the capitol, then sat back while they built gallows in front of the capitol, stormed the building shouting ""Hang Mike Pence"". This man sat back while his followers attempted to execute an elected official in the streets in order to keep him in power.

This is a man who said ""Hitler did some good things too"", who praises Putin and Kim Jong Un, who invites adversaries to Mar-a-Lago to go take a nice dump in his bathroom full of nuclear secrets.

A man who says he will deport 10-20 million people using the military and end immigration in 6 days. How do you think those 6 days would go? While armed forces are dragging people's neighbors, friends, colleagues, lovers, children, parents, etc out of their homes and stacking them onto ships, trains and planes to drop them off to die in the desert somewhere? You think everyone just sits back and the country doesn't tear itself apart?

How on earth can you vote for someone like that? How on earth do you look at a future where Americans are pitted against eachother, seeing eachother as the enemy? That's your idea of America? That's the country you ""patriots"" want to build?",2024_11_03,05_39_46
">Yes and No. Being unapologetic is part of his brand.

Dude he has no idea what's going on anymore...

It's time for people who have been around people who had the same condition to let people know what's next:

He's going to start doing that phasing in and out of reality thing, then he's going to start getting bouts of the shakes, at that point, he won't be able to hide the serious neurological condition he has anymore, which to be clear, the brain is part of that system.

I'm sorry but, the real reason that his behavior is getting worse and worse rapidly, is because his brain's health is rapidly deteriorating. That's the real reason that he's ""turning into Hitler.""

It only works for his groupies anyway; giving them a temporary relief, before trump again exposes how dark and bleak his inner world really is.

I've been banned from this sub five times now, each time for being uncivil with Trump supporters. I earned those bans, and you earned yours. Don't whine about it like you're being oppressed.

As for this story, you're right. It's being taken out of context by a lot of Democrats—just like Republicans took Biden's ""garbage"" comment out of context. Is it intentional? Fuck if I know. What I do know is that this is all the result of the way Trump has degraded political discourse in this country over the past decade. This all goes back to him.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"Is he in cognitive decline? Yes.

Is he mean because he's senile? Nope.

He's always been a mean bastard. His BIOS is being an asshole. His OS is self-interest. Take, take, take and give only promises.

None of these.are affected by his cognitive decline. If anything, they provide a reliable fallback. When Trump is cornered he throws people under the bus. When he is caught unprepared (he always is  lol), he diverts the issue to shit talking.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

DO you think the citizens of this country are going to just sit on their couch, while armed forces kick down doors and drag their neighbors, friends, colleagues, lovers, children, parents, etc out into the streets, tie them up, load them up on ships, trains, planes like cordwood and dump them over the border?

You think that would be a bloodless affair?

Do you think America's adversaries would sit back and do nothing while the country tears itself apart from within. All of the nations that have sat in the shadow of the US military for decades, are just going to sit back and watch while the country ravages itself.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

Not saying that we should send our troops on bogus missions and put them in unintentional danger, but they knew that their job is dangerous and likely involves them being in combat at the order of the US Gov.

Trump made an ""analogy"" that portrays his political opponent being killed. Not tom mention the numerous times he's stated that her and others like her (Miley) should face a televised military tribunal and be tried for treason. (If you weren't aware, this carries the death penalty)

This is a man who riled up his crowds and then sat back and watched while they built gallows in front of the capitol and stormed the building shouting ""Hang Mike Pence"". He stood by and watched while his supporters attempted to execute a sitting official in the streets in order to keep him in power. 

WTF happened to republicans? 20 years ago, the thought of a sitting politician using deadly force to remain in power would be gut wrenching to the ""patriots"". Watching their leader schmooze with Russia and make positive statements of dictators like putin and Kim Jong Un, would have you all seething. Having the leader of the US saying things like ""Hitler did some good things too""...would have you all up in arms.

But now, it's just every day for you to have your leader threaten the life of someone else. To have his followers fire bombing ballot boxes after crying about ""stolen elections"". To have his followers stealing ballots from tenants of their buildings and filing fake votes. To have his followers waving weapons around at polling places, destroying the property of people who support the other candidate, assaulting people for voting a certain way. This is patriotism to you?",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"It's not being taken out of context as much as people say it is... if at all. He declared a scenario where Liz would likely be killed. Many believe he was talking about a firing squad. Many believe he was talking about sending her to war.

He's said multiple times, including on his early campaign page that he wants to bring back firing squads. Including making mention of executing people and sending a bullet back to their family and making their family pay for the cost of the bullet.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"Right. If anything, it is just making the existing tendencies he has always had more visible and frequent, and potentially more dangerous. He has always been this way, it’s just that his brains limited capacities for self control and awareness and all that are declining. In the future we can expect with a high degree of confidence that he will only get more erratic, unstable, and dangerous, not just for the nation, but perhaps for anyone even in his presence. This isn’t just senility. It is so much worse than that. 

Anyone else thinking of that cutscene from Wolfenstein where you meet a senile Adolf Hitler on Venus? A few years ago I would’ve said this comparison was a bit silly, but here and now, I feel like this is actually a reasonable depiction of how a guy like Trump is going to act if he gets back into power and stays there.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

The violence of his tone is proportional to his fear, but it also serves as a way to keep his base angry and at the ready were any consequences to finally hit Dear Leader.

He hasn't changed and gotten more angry or meaner; he just isn't hiding it anymore, because why would he? His supporters like it because they feed off of it, and he's surrounded himself with sycophants who wouldn't have made the cut eight years ago by people still expecting some kind of reasonable continuation of government.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

While this specific statement definitely fits with his pattern of violent rhetoric, I'm simply trying to be intellectually honest when I say that it seemed like he was trying to lean into the ""war hawk"" line of attack and did it in an offensively clumsy way. That's all.

Regardless, this single remark possibly being taken out of context doesn't negate all of the other openly authoritarian rhetoric he keeps using.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

">Two days before Halloween, a Pennsylvania postal worker was delivering a box of mailed-in ballots to the Northampton County Courthouse. A man filming with his phone began asking questions and followed the postal worker into the building.

>The man doing filming was told that the man with the box of ballots was a postal worker.

>“I dunno, apparently he’s with the post office, but that looks very suspect,” said the man filming, zooming in on what he said was “an obscene amount of ballots.”

>The video then zoomed in for a closeup of the postal worker’s face. As of Nov. 2, it had nearly six million views.

>County officials in Pennsylvania confirmed to local news outlets that the man filmed in the video was an acting postmaster, doing his job. After the video went online, he began receiving threats.

"For those who can't read the article:

The Republican Party can’t force Fulton County to hire more of its handpicked election workers right before Election Day, according to a judge’s ruling Friday.

Fulton Superior Court Judge Kevin Farmer rejected the party’s last-minute effort to install partisan poll workers for Tuesday’s election.

The county hired 23 of 61 election workers submitted by the party, but a GOP attorney argued in court that the county should have been required to hire all the poll workers it requested.

“You apply for a job, send out 10 resumes (and) don’t always get called back,” Farmer said. “Some of your folks got hired. … You got a fair percentage.”

Kevin Kucharz, an attorney for the Republican Party, said state law compels Fulton Election Director Nadine Williams to hire the GOP’s election workers.

“There is no purpose in letting parties submit lists unless there’s an intent of the General Assembly to give those people proper consideration and priority,” Kucharz said. “The statute exists to give political parties an inroad into the political system.”

But Farmer said the law doesn’t say political parties get priority in hiring. It only requires consideration and equal representation among political parties that submit names of potential poll workers.

The Democratic Party didn’t submit a list of poll workers it wanted Fulton to hire.

“Please do not let these people throw a wrench into our elections process,” Kaye Burwell, an attorney for Fulton County, asked the judge. “We’re on the eve of Election Day.”

Farmer said an evidentiary hearing is required to determine whether the county considered the Republican Party’s proposed poll workers, and state law gives the county at least 10 days to respond.

The party’s lawsuit can be considered in the coming weeks, but not on an emergency basis before Election Day, Farmer said.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

> Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris has pledged to make the enhanced subsidies on premiums permanent, while her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, has made no such commitment and during his presidency repeatedly worked to weaken the ACA. Among the almost 20 million affected by the potential sunsetting of the subsidies is business owner Chrysa Ostenso.

> Allowing Biden administration policies to sunset would cause subsidies for lower-income families to be &quot;Significantly lower&quot; and subsidies for moderate-income people such as Chrysa Ostenso, whose household income is more than 400% of the federal poverty level, to be &quot;Totally eliminated,&quot; Dietz said.

> The Washington-based Urban Institute published a report that estimated that the expiration of enhanced subsidies could cause 4 million people across the country to become uninsured.

"Being Gen-Z myself (although more of a cusper), i have voted in every single election except for 2016 because i wasnt 18 yet. Every election is just as important as the last one.

So as a message to any and all Gen-Z voters:

If i can make the time to go out and vote and found the time to vote in past elections while working a full time job and attending school with full time credit hours, then you can find the time too. Stop being lazy, or pushing it off until it’s too late, or making excuses about not voting. Trump and the entire Republican Party do not give a fuck about me or you. 

So to remind those struggling with student loan debt or whatever else:

- Trump nominated the judges that would later go on to strike down Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan. They fucked you out of 10-20k of potential relief. 

- Trump hates the LGBTQ community and would seek to oppress a lot of your friend’s rights.

- Trump wants big government to come in and tell you what you can and cannot do with your body.

- The GOP is all for being pro-life up until those same kids end up dying in their school’s classroom and then its just “thoughts and prayers” with the cycle repeating once again.

- The GOP will not raise the national minimum wage despite inflation rising regardless. Instead, billionaires will get additional tax cuts while forcing lower income families to pay more taxes. Lower waged workers will be paying more while the rich enjoy the extra couple million in bonuses. That is not fair. 

- worried about the job market post-grad? It will be much much worse than it seems now

I could keep going. But my point is that Trump does not give a fuck about anybody but himself. He is only loyal to the money and only loyal to the highest bidder. He is an unstable, pedophile, who’s only goal in a hypothetical 2nd Term is to get revenge on anybody who he deems deserves such. That’s not a leader.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

There are other examples but for the sake of discussion I’ll go with these easy ones. I guess I’d like to hear why you think he cares so much about those things.

Mainly because you’re implying that he cares more about those things than the other option. Meanwhile, Harris has been running on a campaign for all people, big tent, endorsements from prominent Republicans, has not ever tried to overturn an election or denigrated constituents, AND her whole career has been spent in public service.

Kamala is not for all people, she’s made that clear a couple times in smirky remarks from interviews or demeanor. Trump has never completely sidelined a group which makes him more for all the people. Trump has however sidelined organizations or politicians, which isn’t where the vote comes from. 

Predominant republicans supporting Harris isn’t reason enough to switch to Harris or to say that Harris is for all people. Anyone who does seems like anything a corrupt politician would do to try and stay in the spotlight or take a seat on the winning side. 

I guess what I’m saying is that I believe Trump is running for more pure reasons. We can say it’s because of the prosecution, but they wouldn’t have done it if he wasn’t running again. Harris, the pick that wasn’t picked has very unclear motive to run. It just doesn’t give me an overall good feeling that with international tensions at rise that when asked an important question she might just cackle and talk in circles because she doesn’t know the answer.

"Let me just address this “for all the people” thing. This is way different than “smirky remarks” from Harris. They are not equivalent, and I think you understand that.

Trump tried to illegally overturn an election without evidence. He said that my vote was fraudulent. I live in WI, I was a municipal clerk, and I worked on the recount. He asked GA to find him votes to win. He tried to litigate his way past fair election losses across the country, without evidence. If that isn’t sidelining a group, half of the electorate, I don’t know what to tell you.

He said “so what” to his crowd wanting to kill Mike Pence. He sure wasn’t for that guy.

In 2016 he really hammered on racist tropes and “they’re not sending their best”. There are shitty people of all backgrounds and it’s wrong to take the immigration discussion to that place. I have Mexican in-laws that I love very much. He isn’t for those people.

He approved a toxic joke denigrating Puerto Rico. He isn’t for those people.

Trump has encouraged security/crowds to beat up protestors. He isn’t for those people.

Trump has talked about using the US military against what he calls “the enemy within”. He isn’t for those people.

Finally, regarding the “motive” to run. How is that a red flag? Some people run because they think they can make the country better. And yes, we can talk about the prosecution being Trump’s reason to run: of course the cases would be happening even if he wasn’t running, he is alleged to have broken many federal laws. You think people should get away with that just because they are private citizens? You and I wouldn’t. I would argue that it’s a way better look for Harris running on improving our country’s wellbeing vs Trump running to stop his litigation. It’s quite damning that you can look at a negative reason for Trump running, see nothing of the sort about Harris, and then think “man that must be bad about Harris”.

And, pure reasons. My goodness, the guy has never been transparent. He did not release his tax returns, or his medical records. He didn’t even release a healthcare plan. Musk admitted that the economy will crash under his economic plan.

If you watch the debate (please do so) or really any rally, you would see that Harris clearly and forcefully articulates her plans for America. She isn’t cackling and talking in circles. Trump literally spends time at rallies talking about Hannibal Lecter, Arnold Palmer’s dick, and simulating a blowjob on a microphone. You think that’s better on the international stage?

Look I think it’s really clear from these examples that you have not applied your criticism equally to both sides. It’s laughably bad that you think Kamala talks in circles and laughs too much after every gaffe Trump has had in the last week alone.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"Millennials can be argued to start at 1980.

This ignores the microgap of those born in '88-96. This is the ""Pokemon generation"" or the ""Max Martin musical acts"" generation(Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, N'Sync would be the talk of many pre-teens and teens). They were minors, but they might have noticed the 2000 election being stuck in a recount, and feeling sympathetic to Gore and the environmental message. 9/11 occurred in middle or elementary school, so they weren't served up for military meat initially, but some might have joined after 2006.

Financial crisis '08 hit them right when they were in college or graduating from it.

Yet the original poster thinks this is generation that only consumed South park and The Simpsons to shape their outlook.

The only political Simpsons ep I remember was the Clinton-Dole alien episode, and that episode's point was that the masses are so stupid, they couldn't recognize real politicians from aliens or realize whatever they say(which is true, as politicians are generally engaging in lawyer speak--they are often precisely laywers--while the masses think it's custom, personal message) is pretty much nonsense.

The Monica Lewinsky scandal would have passed over the heads of these later millennial children then, because it just wasn't time for puberty yet; thus the Clintons scandals did not effect the general millennial outlook towards them.

"I’m not on a computer, so I can’t make too lengthy of a reply. I think anyone can agree that questioning the election, or double checking is a fine task to do, no? The election was extremely close as far as the electoral college goes. Asking people to do illegal tasks doesn’t have much integrity and should be frowned upon. Donald’s Trumps rallies however, I’ve seen some clips, I saw the Puerto Rican joke. I thought it was a bad joke, and I don’t think the campaign approved of it beforehand based on what I’ve heard. However, it’s on a similar level of Dave Chappelle’s jokes with the transgender community. 

Just to let you know, my hopes were on Ron Desantis to be nominee or this one guy that couldn’t even gain enough ground to be allowed on the debate stage. Every week he was a couple points behind as they kept raising the cap as time went on the choose a nominee. There’s no world where you were hoping Kamala would be running for president in 2024, it just wasn’t happening. It wasn’t anyone’s pick. Everything Kamala has done in the spotlight has been heavily rehearsed, which isn’t a bad thing, but isn’t a good thing when you don’t get new lines. Kamala was never actually nominated against other candidates, although I understand that the circumstances had put her in the best position to be nominee (including the Biden and Harris campaign money). 

Trumps medical records, taxes, etc. I personally think is a private matter and a matter of privacy for all citizens. If he wishes to share it, he could. 

I really don’t think someone who’s been shot once and almost shot again playing golf would continue running for the wrong reasons. I would think many politicians would quit after the first shot. 

I have looked at both though, I watched most of the DNC. I watched the presidential debate, I’ve watched parts of her rallies if it’s on the TV. I don’t think anyone wants the same thing as the last four years, maybe some people do, but I don’t. 

I had mentioned to my democratic uncle after I watched the DNC that it was nice to see the DNC repping a lot of the colors of the American flag, something that a lot of woke democrats push aside as they think it stands for imperialism. His response to a complement was “They’ve always been more American” 

I just can’t get over the fact that within the democratic party you can’t be a free thinker, you have to be an all or nothing person. Any time I’ve agreed with a democrat in my personal life it’s been “it’s not enough” or “but what about this”. It’s just not a party that’s inviting to me.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

By your own definition, millennials didn't have a lot of voting power for the Gore and Kerry elections. It was only during the Obama campaign that millennials finally had enough numbers to start changing elections.

And millennials, like every other age demographic, share part of the blame for the Hillary vs. Trump years. Absolutely. But they are not primarily to blame for the events that happened while most of them weren't old enough to be eligible to vote.

"He literally asked GA to find him votes. That is blatantly illegal. All of the cases he brought had no evidence, and he knew that, case closed. His lies resulted in people dying.

Taxes are not a private matter for presidents because they can show foreign debt and conflicts of interest. Medical records are important, especially for an elderly candidate. Don’t you want to know if he is physically capable and of sound mind to hold office? Harris released hers. Transparency matters.

Plenty of “free thinkers” in the Democratic Party. Again, Harris is currently endorsed by people ranging from Sanders to Dick Cheney. That is hardly “all or nothing, you have to agree with all of it to join us”.

And yes he would run after being shot at if he was afraid of pending litigation.

And yes obviously the campaign vetted the entire routine and put it on the teleprompter. No campaign lets someone on stage without clear instruction of what to say. They even made him drop a joke calling Harris a c**t.

All that stuff, the election interference, the Cheney-in-the-firing-squad, the bad hombres, the “knock those guys around”, the “good people on both sides” (regarding a Nazi march), the “enemy within”.

"\>Given that the post I replied to is now deleted, I can't go back and check, but no, it wasn't.

Yes, it was. I did not pin the election losses exclusively on the Millennials, I am pinning the elections on the non-voters. And sorry to break it to you, but for a generation that likes to bitch about how the Boomers have ruined their lives, the Millennials haven't really done much to do the bare minimum to fight back; voting. At least the Gen Zers have made historic turnouts since 2018 (albeit they're not doing enough).

\>By your own definition, millennials didn't have a lot of voting power for the Gore and Kerry elections.

Wrong. There were already millions of young adult Millennials back in the Gore and Kerry days: [https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/age-distribution-for-united-states-population.html](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/age-distribution-for-united-states-population.html)

Those Millennials certainly had a lot of power in the swing states.

\>But they are not primarily to blame for the events that happened while most of them weren't old enough to be eligible to vote.

I didn't say they were primarily to blame, that is not the point. The point that u/ Hardass\_McBadCop was making is that the reason why Boomers have dominant influence over public policy is because they are the ones who are voting most of the time. It wouldn't be that way if Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Zers had mobilized. And the fact is that Millennials DID have the chance to elect Gore and Kerry. Not mention they didn't show up for Hillary, who should have easily won 2016.

The Millennials and the Gen Zers will have to act more responsibly and take action to fight back against the policies that are harming them instead bitching on the internet about old people having all the power. You want to get rid of the Boomers? Vote them out.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

Basically it's this: there is a significant gender divide among Gen Z in regards to candidate support. *But*, Harris is still favored by both groups: overwhelmingly by women and slightly by men. In the Harvard study I posted (which as I said was a much larger sample than the Sienna poll I see cited in a lot of these articles) the gap among likely male Gen Z voters is actually much bigger: 53%-37% and Women are more like 70%-30%. Still a big gap, but both strongly favoring Harris

What OP keeps posting is an article about how Trump is attempting to activate the Apolitical young male vote to try and flip those numbers. This isn't a surprise, it's Steve Bannon's playbook and exactly what he did in 2016, only back then it was going on infowars and seeding the memesphere on places like Reddit and the Chans. The medium now has shifted to the podcast influencer griftsphere, but it's the same thing.

>Rhetorically matter-of-fact, the piece succinctly lays out many of the reasons Trump’s critics think his second term would be disastrous for the country—the implicit point being that nobody really needs a lengthy review of all Trump’s actions; everyone already knows what he’s about.

It really is an obvious choice. Now we need to vote.

The manufacturing sector was in a recession all of 2019 because of his trade war, and we were going to experience an economy-wide downturn in his last year even without covid—and then he went and completely fucked that up.

Again, I can't stress this enough: It's not just about ""mean tweets."" It's not that he needs to get a filter.

"I can understand you listing out your important issues and saying that your preferred solutions are more in line with the Republican Party's beliefs. That's fine. I was a Republican many years ago, so I understand where you're coming from.

What I'll never understand is how you can just look past all of the people in Trump's administration who've come out against him. It's unprecedented in American history. These are people from his own party who worked with him up close on a daily basis. These are people he appointed. They know his temperament and his personality far more than the rest of us who only see him from afar. They know him better than the talking heads on TV. They're telling us that he's an authoritarian and that it's an incredible risk to give him an ounce of power. His own vice president has refused to endorse him. 

This should all be a big flashing warning sign. Instead, Trump supporters shrug it off and choose to believe a single source—Trump himself. A man who cheated on every wife he's ever had and defrauded a children's cancer charity. 

You're free to do that, of course. No one is going to stop you from placing all of your faith in one man. But you're going to have to get used to the idea of being lumped in with Donald Trump. The notion that the Republican Party is the home for tradition and values and patriotism and common decency has flown the coop. That became laughable when the party decided to stand behind Trump after January 6. 

There's a very good reason that many Republicans are choosing to abandon ship. You'll survive the next four years just fine without him in office. It's less clear whether the country can survive another four years with him as president. You don't have to vote for Harris. You can just leave that top spot blank. No one will ever know.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

When your entire life has been getting your way, you can't comprehend why something doesn't go your way.  You don't understand why your illegals acts are now in court.  He doesn't want to be held to a higher standard because he feels that he is the higher standard.

"Even though for my whole adult life (first voted in 2016) I have only known about the Trump era and cannot discernibly look back at other eras (perhaps a little bit of the Obama era in high school), I think Trump simply exposed a lot of rot that was hiding beneath the surface for a very long time. There is a particular affliction within this country that people conflate freedom of speech with freedom to believe any reality other than their own. That, combined with our material wealth, excess privilege, and our relative social isolation compared to many countries, allows for willful ignorance and paranoid stances on simple constructs of reality.

If you do look back at American History, this is a core tenet that drives much of our cultural 'traditions', and I think it gets exposed from time to time again. For example, the Civil War was fought over the idea of slavery (some regressives will tell you otherwise), which pro-slave advocates fought over the very nature of reality of this country and it's 'traditions'. Really we all can boil it down to self-serving principles lo and behold, but there have been many iterations of this channeling of willful ignorance that occur many more times in our history (Mccarthyism, weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the Jacksonian economic ideas, Prohibition, etc..)

Trumpism and the MAGA movement is only the latest form of that willful ignorance that is blind to how it damages the country. But as long as the people pushing the MAGA movement preserve the 'traditions' of what this country is about and stick it to the people that are driving us towards atheism and a multi-cultural and global society (aka elitists and liberals), they are psychologically more than okay with their moral hypocrisy and inconsistency within their own rhetoric. As long as they get to define freedom for the rest of their countrymen without consequence, as crazy as their views are, they really do think they are saving us from eternal damnation as a society. We can blame Russia all we want and other foreign actors such as China or Iran,. All the Russians saw (they have a better understanding of how our country functions then we do sometimes), is how easy it is to ruse our countrymen to fight against ourselves over our basic tenets our democracy and institutions. If anything, we have no one to blame except ourselves for the position we put ourselves in much of the time because we do have this weird deliberate ignorance about us that has dictated much of our policy.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

> NEW YORK - Vice President Kamala Harris has made an unannounced trip to New York to appear on &quot; Saturday Night Live,&quot; briefly stepping away from the battleground states where she&#039;s been campaigning with just three days to go before the election.

> Actor Maya Rudolph first played Harris on the show in 2019 and has reprised her role this season, doing a spot-on impression of the vice president, including calling herself &quot;Momala.""

> &quot;Maya Rudolph - I mean, she&#039;s so good,&quot; Harris said last month on ABC&#039;s &quot;The View.&quot; &quot;She had the whole thing, the suit, the jewelry, everything!&quot;.

"This was awhile ago, but I worked in a venue that had motor driven microphones that came out of the floor.   The speaker was super cranky to the tech team during setup.  When he got ready to come on stage he said ""Fuck these techs, we are not paying"" to his manager.  It was overheard by a stage hand, and word got around.  

The sound guy was the hero.  Every few mins he would bump the microphone up and down and the speaker would adjust.  Towards the end he bumped it down, then down, then down and the speaker kept leaning down more and more.  It was time for the speakers big finish, the sound guy bumped down one more time and just before the finale, hit the up button for a long hit.  Microphone hit the speaker in the mouth before the last line.  Electrics then did a stage blackout and mashed the houselights to full.  It was glorious, speaker holding their face, speech unfinished, audience saying ""WTF"" and laughing.  

And we did get paid, during the show the stage crew blocked the speaker and manager's car in until the money was turned over.

"Let’s ignore the homophobia for a moment. Bear with me here…

As a gay man who has seen every iteration of Tucker Carlson since he got his start—from the bowtied, young Republican dweeb trying to seem like a reasonable adult to the current bro-douche who uses the word “dude” like he’s one of the cool guys—it is amazing, and I mean *shockingly amazing*, that Tucker Carlson is accusing someone else of being *gay*.

I always assumed Tucker was gay; total power-bottom vibes. I figured he was just in the closet. Hell, I can even remember feeling sorry for the little dork.

Let’s be honest about Tucker. Even if he’s not a gay man hiding in a glass closet, he is most *definitely* **not manly**. I’m more manly than he is. I probably own more guns than he does, too. I’m also more of a sensible conservative than he is—even though I’m a liberal—because no right-minded conservative would vote for Donald Trump.

Tucker… sweet pea… any time you want to meet a real, live gay man and compare your manhood to mine, I’m game, you punk ass bitch.

Tim Walz is the dad I wish I’d had. He’s the dad a lot of us wish we’d had (and I wish Tucker had had a father like him, too, because then maybe we wouldn’t have to listen to him work through his own insecurities on TV). I’m voting for Walz as much as I’m voting for Harris. He’s exactly the kind of *man* America needs.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"TLDR

In a New Republic article, Tucker Carlson’s recent fixation on Minnesota Governor Tim Walz reflects Carlson’s struggle with Walz’s unforced, non-traditional masculinity. Carlson’s mockery—often using juvenile, homophobic insults—highlights the discomfort some on the political right have with Walz’s straightforward support of LGBTQ+ youth and effortless masculinity. 

Unlike Carlson and other figures who emphasize performative machismo, Walz represents an acceptance of diverse expressions of masculinity that unnerves traditional gender ideologues. This dynamic underscores broader political anxieties around changing gender norms.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"They cannot conceive of an adult who doesn’t treat masculinity like a 13 year old boy.

Their own masculinity is a constant, draining performance.  At all times, they must be doing the most masculine thing.  They gotta hate girls(while also being obsessed with them as sexual objects). They gotta hate gays.  They can’t express any affection towards another male (be a best friend, their own father, or their male children) without worrying about “gay” jt comes off. They gotta make their entire personality “masculine.” They live their life like the 12 year old’s understanding of an 80s action star. They haven’t had a moments rest from deliberately performing their sex and sexuality since their first pube.

The very concept of a guy who isn’t worried about any of that, but still ticks a bunch of masculine boxes?  That a guy who will hug his son in public, that waves a little weird, that doesn’t police people’s sexuality, or sex, a man who is comfortable around women, so effortlessly achieves the performance they work and sweat at every waking moment?

"It has nothing to do with feminism.

There’s this idea that because something is happening with men it *must* be to do with women. But that’s horseshit. The only way into establish it’s true is to separate every variable that can possibly differentiate men and women and test to what extent each one relates to loneliness.

Feminism as a force in education has been around since at least the ‘70s. This crisis in male mental health has been a thing since the early ‘00s and gathering pace since the ‘10s. It just doesn’t have any connection to feminism. In fact on measures of loneliness and depression *women are affected too*. On some measures, *worse*.

This isn’t a women-vs-men thing or a feminism-too-far thing, or whatever. It’s so weird that people have latched into feminism as a causative force. It’s almost like a right-wing shaping-the-conversation operation…

The real question is what emerged in the late ‘90s and gained pace through the ‘00s and ‘10s that made people—especially kids and young people who perhaps adopted it early and more enthusiastically—more isolated, less inclined to spend time together physically, more dopamine-addicted, less socially capable, more distracted, and therefore lonelier and lower achieving?

Might there be *multiple interlinked* things like that, some of which were taken up by boys and young men (on average) earlier and more enthusiastically than by girls and young women?

People get super defensive about things like video games and porn, and insist on outsourcing blame for their effects to feminism. But feminism had been around for decades before this “crisis of masculinity” emerged. Video games and porn—at the scale and accessibility they developed and spread during the ‘00s and ‘10s—were completely revolutionary. It would be more surprising if they *hadn’t* had some colossal effect on their overwhelmingly-male user base than if they had. Ten years behind came social media, with a slightly female-oriented user base. And we’re seeing the same crisis emerge among young women, about a decade behind.

This has nothing to do with men versus women or with feminism or society swinging too far to support one side. It has everything to do with the internet and its related forces being revolutionary and harmful. “Because feminism” is a distraction and a salve so that people can justify not changing behaviours they like. It’s like that person everyone knew in 2011 who’d tell you about how this one guy in Peru smokes twelve cigarettes a day and lived to 120.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"Sometimes all it takes is a little bit of introspection from a situation that could have gone really bad, but only luck saved you. 

I’m no Tim Walz, but I had a few moments like that. In my early 20s, I was driving myself, my then-partner, my roommate, and their partner back from a gathering a few hundred miles from home, driving during daylight, no bad weather. Less than halfway home, all my passengers fell asleep. 2/3 of the way home, I fell asleep, and drove off the interstate at about 70. Pure dumb luck about exactly where that happened, no one was hurt, total damage to the car was ~$50 parts and labor - this was the mid 80s, things were cheaper then - at the repair place a block from my apartment, AAA towed it home for free. But a 1/2 mile either direction we would have gone over a hillside, everyone would have been hurt badly, maybe killed. I haven’t driven tired since, if I feel myself getting tired I pull over somewhere safe and take a 20 minute nap. 

Same with drinking. I once found myself going *waaaay* over the speed limit while probably well over the BAC limit, I slowed down, and always have a lot of water and sober up before driving anywhere. 

And learning from others, I used to never wear my seatbelt, even after it became law, because it wasn’t law when I was growing up or for several years after I began driving. Then I heard a friend, who probably fell asleep driving, drove off into the median and rolled his car, everyone was killed, at least one was ejected during the roll. The cops said that if they’d been wearing their seatbelts they would have still all been injured, but not killed. The next day I began wearing my seatbelt religiously. 

So, nothing permanently bad happened to me or mine from those earlier dumb choices, but they could have, and I realized it before it got to that point, and changed my ways.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

If Trump hoped that Pence would eventually come around, put party over country, and grudgingly throw his support behind the Republican ticket, those hopes have been dashed.

It must be hard for some of these people to wonder why their friends think they are Nazi adjacent, bigoted, stupid, uninformed.

When they reach out to Google they get fed their lane and they remain confused. 

Trump has a produced a Bully tactic. He muddies accusations against him by reversing them back. He projects his actions on his enemies (the radical left enemies that will need the military to stop is an interesting example - his followers may need to be stopped with the National Guard.)

We need a name for this style other than Fascism. Like a political version of the Gish Gallop.

I use to refer to the Chaos Theory of Government: be less than competent on programs you don’t support, then blame government/opponent for its inability to help people. Accumulate more power. Rinse and repeat. 

I do hope we have psychologist researching this phenomenon and updating from early Fascist research.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

Arthur said in one interview that Garfield hadn't been ""honest or square"" about one controversial appointment. Garfield ended up being assassinated a year into his presidency, so we'll never know how their conflict would have continued.

"Interesting thought.  If Biden were to use the wartime powers act, I think he could nationalize SpaceX, revoke Musk's citizenship, and deport him.

I wonder if there are reasonable ways for him to shut down Twitter as well under his ""core responsibilities.""  I'd actually love to see Twitter become a non-profit and go back to what it was, so maybe he could combine it with NPR?

Sadly, I'm sure Biden won't do any of this, but it would definitely make the world a better place on his way out :(",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"He still have his security clearance, and is the CEO of the company.  He doesn't do much on the engineering side of the house, but he's the one that (working from memory) first wanted to charge the US for operating starlink over Ukraine, then is accused of regularly cut off starlink access in specific portions of Ukraine and Russia.  For accuracy, I know one of the reports of him turning it off turned out to be false, he just wouldn't extent coverage over Crimea - ironically claiming US sanction if I remember.

Recent rumors are that he also was asked by China through Putin to not provide Starlink coverage to Taiwan.

So while he's not doing the micro stuff, he is still directing US policy on the Macro level.

On the issue of immigration law, I don't think that's been proven one way or the other yet - just accused.

What I'd been more interested is if you could strip him of his US citizenship and force him to sell off some of his US properties like we are maybe doing with TikTok.

If he's kicked out, you could also argue Twitter would be in the same situation as TikTok.

So, I'll be surprised if he faced any consequences, but there are certainly some fun things that could be done to him if anyone has the balls :P",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"I find it hard to believe the US didn't know about these already, but was, for whatever reason, quietly ignoring them.

Still, there is a massive double standard here.  If I so much get a contact high from someone smoking pot, I would have lost my security access (contractor back in the day) and be barred from military facilities (for whatever reason, they *really* don't like marihuana at the federal level).

And what does musk do?  Likes up a big one on a broadcast podcast with Rogan!

Again, at best, I would have gotten a review and a reprimand (never mind the doing it in public part), but I'm pretty sure my Security Clearance would have been struck and I would have been standing outside before I could blink, and probably still wouldn't be let onto any military facility today.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"I think it comes down to that he's been shielded from his crimes by the corporations taking the fine/charge.  The only other one I'm aware of is his smoking weed with Rogan, which would lose anyone else their clearance on the spot, but apparently we as a country decided to ignore that.

Now, having conversations with ""friends"" in Russia is not illegal, when your ""friend"" is the leader of a country that is very much hostile to the US, that's one hell of a red flag.  My hope is that the CIA was aware of and monitoring these calls, but if not, the nature of these calls needs to be immediately investigated, and that is where I think something that could affect Musk personally (as opposed to being able to hide behind his businesses) could be uncovered.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"Unfortunately, I don't think it can.  The Government can exercise eminent domain on property and equipment, and the can use the defense production act to tell you what to make, but they can't actually strip you of your ownership.

If there was specific criminal cause, I think they could kick you out as CEO, kind of like how Trump is no longer allowed to do business in NY, but other than fines, Musk would still own SpaceX.

However, that's general law.  The US essentially created the TSA by nationalizing airport security industry, and there's been multiple cases where companies have been at least partially or temporarily nationalized after bankruptcy (the most recent being the bank and auto industry rescues done by Obama.

With SpaceX's current status I don't think either of these options are valid though :(

What you need is to actually catch him handing off US secure documents to the Russians or the Chinese.  That's about the only thing I can think of that would outright break him loose from SpaceX, and as much as I'd love to see him gone, I honestly hope he's not trading US tech secrets :(",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"I think if you found out he'd been selling secrets, or otherwise compromising national security, it would give you the ground to prevent him from doing business in the US, or exercising his shareholder rights.  The company would be put under stewardship until next steps were decided.  This is basically what has happened to Trump in NY.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

It has always been illegal to enter the US on one type of VISA when you intend to do something else.  Musk entered on a Student VISA which requires you to be enrolled in a US school.  He never enrolled nor attended University.  Thus he stayed in the US illegally.

Yeah I’m sure they know but politics is probably getting in the way here. Imagine if they revoke the security clearance of the man bankrolling Trump and in doing so kills one of his businesses. There’s also a factor of NASA is now reliant on SpaceX for many launches now,2024_11_03,05_39_46

"According to the courts, he doesn't need justification.  He can just say our stockpiles are lower than they should be, and as commander and chief, I'm taking over the assembly line.

But it's really broad, as Biden invoked it for clean energy technologies, I believe based on a report that Global Warming needed to be considered a National Security issue.

And both Biden and Trump used it during Covid. Trump used it to crack down on hoarding, limit exports of medical goods, and increase production of ventilators and other supplies. Biden used it to speed up vaccination and testing efforts.

So you don't even need an active war, just something that you can claim is connected to National Defense, and it becomes a very flexible little tool.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"To be fair, *especially* if Trump wins, I hope Biden just goes whole hog - let Ukraine off the hook - start actually investigating Israeli war crimes . . . all sorts of fun things.

Of course, I also probably would also charge three of the SCOTUS judges with undermining the Rule of Law and Constitution for their ""the President is immune stunt,"" and at least had Thomas investigated for corruption charges.

"I will track down the relevant sources for you. He was on a J-1 Visa.  He got a bachelors then was accepted into Stanford but never attended. He stayed on a J-1 Student VISA which he then has claimed was turned into an H-1B VISA.  He claimed that it was the way it works but that is not how it works. H-1B VISA's are temporary work permits which require a sponsor.  Legally speaking he could not sponsor himself.  Being in the US on a J-1 VISA would have required him to leave the US when he was no longer enrolled in a school, then have a sponsor give him an H-1B VISA to return to the US.  Legally speaking he could not found a company in the US on a J-1 VISA. 

>The visa allows temporary entry into the United States to participate in an exchange program.
>J-1 visa holders are authorized to work if they enter the U.S. as part of an exchange program that specifically authorizes working in a certain industry or profession.
>Spouses and children of exchange program participants may be entitled to the J-2 classification and employment visas, although their income must not be used to support the J-1 holder’s participation in the program.

Legally speaking he was also required by law to admit to whether or not he stayed in the US at any point illegally before he could become naturalized. 

We have documentation that his board of directors knew of his illegal status and there were meetings about the subject and what to do about it. We have documentation that he did not disclose those as he was legally required to do upon application to be a US citizen. 

In the 1990's they did not enforce those rules as often.  However, considering the rhetoric from the people demanding that everyone follow those laws, you would think that Elon Musk's own status would be an issue and that he should be held to the exact same standard that he is publicly insisting others be held to. 

He's an immigrant, who doesn't seem to want to integrate, instead he wants to turn the US into South Africa.

"I hope they finally start holding people accountable too, but I suspect we're going to get the same old ""reconciliation policies"" we've been seeing all along. I do think that Republicans and their sponsors have no idea what actual consequences are and likely won't understand it until Democrats stop trying to placate the zealots. It would be karmic justice if Democrats started to use the actual laws equally and I would love to see Elon Musk denaturalized for breaking the immigration laws and his attempts to overthrow democratically elected governments.

*****
> Trump and his vice presidential pick JD Vance have been running a campaign that they say puts the working class first, vowing to protect everyday Americans from an influx of immigrant labor, to return manufacturing jobs to the U.S., to support rural areas and families with children and, generally, to stick it to the elites.

> Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not respond to a detailed list of questions from ProPublica about whether Trump wants to distance himself from his first-term record on issues affecting working-class people or whether his second-term agenda would be different.

> Trump hasn&#039;t faced many of these questions on the campaign trail or in debates or interviews, as the candidates and reporters covering them tend to focus more on the middle class.

"Republican party is the party of Unity, Peace and Free speech. Biden, Harris, and the fake news have done everything in their power to eliminate free speech,  silencing people who come out with the TRUTH. We all know why they do this and it is for money. Politicians should have the best interest in the American people, not their own pockets. They do it through sponsorship by of the biggest corporations in the world, passing legislation to benefit them and paying democrats off. This makes Americans sick and poor. They have also increased the cost of living by 50% in the past 4 years when it should only go up 2% each year on average. How did they do this? unwise spending of our hard earned tax dollars and an increase in tax for all WORKING CLASS AMERICANS. They have made it so hard for us to live because everything is so expensive. If they would start making energy in the united states and stop funding the wars (which Trump will do) the inflation of this country will be restored. Trump also had the best economy of all time but who can be surprised?, he’s one of the most successful businessmen on the planet. That is the #1 thing affecting the working class so I believe in Trump. MAGA 🇺🇸",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"It’s embarrassing how misinformed this comment is. “Not their own pockets”? Trump made $1.7 billion while in office in violation of the emoluments clause. He overcharged the Secret Service by 300% to stay in his hotels. The US is producing more oil now than it ever has. Inflation, that Trump is largely responsible for, is the lowest it has been in 3.5 years. Trump gave tax cuts to billionaires while raising taxes for the middle and lower classes. He tanked Obama’s economy. He added an unprecedented $8.4 trillion to the national debt. He has the worst jobs record of any president in modern history. He’s a failed businessman and a serial fraud and conman. If he was so successful, why is he selling watches, shoes, bibles, crypto, NFT’s, coins and Christmas decorations? ",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"If that’s true, then why are everyone from Liz Cheney to AOC **united** against Trump?? I’ve never seen so many republicans, many from Trump’s own cabinet, endorse a democrat. 

Perhaps it’s because Trump calls American citizens the enemy within and wants to use the army against them. He is suing news stations for interviewing his opponents, so no free speech there. 

Many economists have ridiculed Trump’s economic plan. Is it really a plan? Does he ever have a plan? All he did the first time was blow up the deficit and lost jobs. I’ll be shocked if he has a concept. 

Trump is not a unity president. He’s an awful and sick man whose mind turned to soup. He’s too old to be president.

When China shut down everything it meant that no one was doing refining work for things like metals.  It's amazing in and of itself that the US is doing so well.

Newsflash: The entire globe was hit with the COVID-19 pandemic (that's why it's called a pandemic).  The US has actually recovered faster than the rest of us.

"Plenty of economists have commented on this and most agree that it was neither Trump nor Biden's fault, but mostly due to COVID-related disruptions and corporate greed. Biden did a lot to manage inflation, and the US got off pretty well AND avoided a recession.

It also included a tax cut for the middle class, but that one *slowly expired*, reducing the amount of money Americans had available to them.

Elon wanted an app with free speech, THE FIRST AMENDMENT, and the most important right in our democracy. These companies PAY the democratic party so they can silence people who know what’s really going on. Why would they do such a bad thing and why should you believe it!? Because they have power and they don’t want to lose it. They do whatever they can to keep taking our money so they make Trump a criminal to try to keep him out of office. Why does he have so many supporters? Because people are starting to see the truth about the political leaders in this country. They don’t care about us but Donald Trump isn’t a part of their corruption. In fact, he’s gotten people from the democratic party to endorse him like Bobby Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbert. The news media made them seem like horrible people but go ahead and listen to them talk and you’d be blown away.

"I’m glad you asked that. First I want to start by saying I don’t think Trump is perfect. Nobody is perfect. But who else is going to get the job done? Trump is a very influential person and he knows a lot of good people. Just look at his previous record. I know you’re gonna say it was horrible but it really wasn’t, look up a comparison of data between the Trump and Biden administrations and it’s clear who outperformed who. The most important part of his administration that helped lower and middle class was job opportunities and decreased taxes which decreased inflation making cost of living cheaper. When cost of living is cheaper we have more things we can do with our money, go do fun things, get better food or whatever. When you’re struggling financially like most Americans are today, you can’t live beyond your means. It’s kinda sad how bad the economy has gotten and there’s no way you like paying $4-5 for gas. Personally, I see Trump as a very humble man who cares about his family and hard working people. He will place tariffs on other countries which will increase job opportunities in America dramatically benefiting the middle class. He’s also way more competent than Harris and since it’s a 2 party systems it’s obvious who the best candidate is.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

He cares so much about his family that he cheated on every wife he’s ever had? Second, the average gas price is $3.12 and gas prices rose under Trump because he colluded with Putin, Saudi Arabia and OPEC to decrease oil production. Third, Trump’s tax plan gave triple the tax cuts to households in the top 1-5% than it did for the bottom 60%. Fourth, tariffs are not placed ON other countries. They’re placed on imports FROM other countries and will be passed onto consumers which will cost a minimum of an extra $4,000 per year.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
">As for Bobby Kennedy, he’s labeled a conspiracy theorist for speaking up about a correlation between the decline in health and invention of vaccines.

And there we go.

The first vaccine was developed in 1796. Here are some figures for life expectancy between 1700-present: [https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy#:\~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20global%20average%20life%20expectancy](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20global%20average%20life%20expectancy) Do you want to go back to 18th century standards of health? 

Diseases eliminated or drastically reduced by vaccines include: Diphtheria, polio, rubella, and smallpox. I'd include measles and pertussis in that list, but guys like your dear ol' Bobby K. are rooting for a comeback. Have you ever seen an infant with pertussis? I'm sure you can put your amazing research skills to work to find a video on YouTube.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

*""In this op-ed, Teen Vogue's editor in chief argues that voting Harris is our best chance of stopping the irreversible damage of another Trump presidency.""*

>I know we’ve all compartmentalized in various ways to even make it this close to Election Day. We’ve avoided the news or ignored headlines and stories because we need to get on with our lives. But democracy is not guaranteed. It is a group effort that requires we all be involved.

>Right now, we have the power to stop Trump. Should he win, we may not have these tools at our disposal again. Trump is on the record telling conservative Christians he just needs them to vote this year and then [they won’t have to vote again](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/us/politics/trump-votes-christians.html). “Four more years, it’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians,” he said this summer, one of many comments that should have set off a weeks-long scandalous news cycle but got subsumed by, well, everything else. He has an [army of election deniers](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/13/swing-states-election-deniers-vote-count) ready to do his corrupt, anti-democratic bidding.

>There are [any number of things you can do](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ways-to-get-involved-2024-campaigns) right now through Election Day: volunteer, phone bank, canvass or knock on doors, write postcards or letters, offer to drive people to the polls, [volunteer as a poll worker](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-to-become-a-poll-worker).

[It can be challenging](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBfRCuQx3jK/?igsh=MWQwcnZ1anNyNWM3NQ==), but life under a Trump-Vance administration would be infinitely more so.

>Hillary Clinton comfortably won the popular vote in 2016 — by *millions* — but lost the electoral college by razor-thin margins, in part because people thought they couldn’t make a difference, or that it was work best left up to somebody else.

>No one is coming to save us. We have to save ourselves, and each other. Any of the issues you care about will be impossible to fight for under a Trump administration.

>If you’ve got any anxiety or concern about this election, I urge you to channel that into action. There’s no more putting it off or tuning it out. This is it.

"No one is saying Harris is that good. There was a reason why she dropped out early in the 2020 democratic primary race. That being said, she is much better than Trump. She is younger, can form sentences, and doesn’t form bonds with US adversaries. That alone should win it but beyond that, she doesn’t have 34 felonies and many other court cases against her. She doesn’t claim political interference when people dislike her or disagree with her. Her background as a prosecutor is a great foundation to being a President. Unfortunately her campaign started historically late and she is still the underdog. Additionally, this country tends to swing to the extremes every four years and the incumbent usually doesn’t perform well. It will be an interesting election",2024_11_03,05_39_46

Trump being unable to even hear someone disagree, and maintaining no basis in reality is scary. like trillions wasted on building walls as a a giant gesture that no one sane thought will solve immgration. he killed 43% More repubicans during covid because of his horrible messaging, promoting horse dewormer and weakening the use of masks.

Now trump’s disastrous ideas include tarriffs that will make everything crazy expensive (thought you disliked inflation, lets make it 10x worse?)

"To my fellow citizens, your qualms and reservations for not voting for Harris or at all are completely valid, especially on Palestine. Nevertheless, I implore you to do so for purely strategic reasons. You have the opportunity, which expires Tuesday evening, to choose your opponent and battleground for the next four years by voting for Harris. A Harris administration will be exponentially more pliable in regards to ending the genocide in Palestine come next week due to AIPAC funding being neutered till the midterm elections in 2026 and the Presidential election in 2028. 
If we allow via inaction a Trump turned Vance administration to to gain power we will have too many fronts to fight domestically (elimination of bodily autonomy for Women, LGBTQ persecution, climate shattering deregulation, mass deportations of non-whites, violent crackdowns on dissidents, and every other Fascistic measure outlined and ready to be signed on day 1 in Project 2025) to apply any pressure on Israel, stop the flow of weapons, and save Palestinian lives.
If we shirk away from our collective duty to show up and do our duty on Tuesday we will assuredly lose decades of progress we have fought so hard to attain. I voted for the Green Party in 2016 as a protest to Clinton's war hawking. I will not make that mistake again. If you ever wondered what you would do when Fascism rears its ugly head, you're currently doing it. Vote now and stomp them back into irrelevance.

"Most commenters haven’t read the article ofc. It’s aimed at voters, mostly young, who do not want to vote for Kamala due to the Biden / Harris administration’s complicity in genocide in Gaza. It makes the point that Trump would be far worse in every way imaginable not just for Gaza but on every other aspect of American life with a focus on our ability to organize and protest. 

When you’re young it’s especially hard to stomach that you almost never get to vote for a candidate who you feel truly shares your ideals. And you haven’t been through enough hell in life to understand that taking the better option is just that — the better option. That incremental progress is better than scorched earth that sets a movement back a generation.

That’s where we are now. Trump set us back a generation with his Supreme Court appointments and nearly a decade of destroying democracy. The level of propaganda and Nazi outrage here that has been entirely normalized would even look out of place decades ago.

If Trump wins we’re finished and there certainly will be no more Gaza. He will give Netanyahu whatever he wants in exchange for beachfront property. 

We’ve brought very few refugees here from the crisis, and make mistake that Trump is including them with all the immigrants he wants to immediately deport. And by “immigrants” he means black and brown people. 

Teen Vogue targets our most racially diverse generation ever. Half of Gen-Z’s population are people of color. Trump is targeting that half of the population, plus all white women who do not want to be baby factories slated for death if they ever need life-saving abortion care or related medical care.

And I think that Biden has been the best president of all time, and I’m angry he hasn’t gotten a chance to serve a second term. 

But this isn’t about what’s best or fair; it’s about what’s not catastrophic. Kamala Harris doesn’t have a great platform. She might be a little irritating as president. Walz might have made some dumb mistakes.

"A bit of a controversial take: You shouldn't elect leaders based on ideals because that's not actually what their job is about. No President in American history, and the vast majority of political leaders in world history wouldn't pass some voter's standards today. I'm not even talking about an unreasonably high standard. Just a basic ideal of what a President should do. Help the poor? Stop wars? None of them would do a better job of that than the current crop of people. Not Washington, not Lincoln, Not Kennedy, no one. A lot of people are holding out waiting for a leader that has never existed and will never exist.

The President is America's manager. Their job is to keep things profitable for the nation, and to guide the nation through challenges that are unavoidable in as steady a job as possible. Sometimes that means doing good things, but really a lot of the time that means making some ugly choices that puts the American government and American economy above other nations and even some American citizens. If you take a honest look at history, that's what the job has always been and will always be.

With that being said, we know what Trump is like as a leader and it's a fucking incompetent mess. You get the same ugly choices except with a lot more pettiness, chaos, bad PR, and bad long term consequences. At least Harris will do a reasonable job of keeping things steady. It's not romantic.

I know this sounds condescending, but I’m basing it off myself. Let me explain. 

When I was a teen I had a punk phase. During the 2000 election, I was *very vocal* about how I didn’t want Bush to win. How he was horrible. 
Deep down, watching the returns, I was secretly hoping he would win. ***Not because I was secretly conservative***. Not because I supported any of his policies. The complete opposite. ***BUT***, deep down in that twilight between conscious and subconscious, I felt like with Bush my righteous rage against the system would be more justified than under Gore. I’d have more to protest. I could be all Black Bloc about shit and it would make way more sense and more people would sympathize with it. 
Ya, I was secretly really happy with how it went down. 

Of course I matured and grew out of this. This naive selfish myopic cosplay ***of wanting to be*** Winston Smith.

"They may not know the dilemma Biden and Harris are facing and they think Netanyahu is puppet of Biden and Harris. If Biden and Harris are not doing what they think will stop Netanyahu, it must be because Biden and Harris want Netanyahu to continue, or they don't care about Palestinians. 

The only people who commit war crimes are Hamas and Netanyahu coalitions. Both Harris and Biden are very clear on pushing everyone to cease fire. They push for the two state solution for long term peaceful coexistence.

Biden and Harris support sending arms to Israel because most Americans support it. They don't want Netanyahu to continue the aggression. But Netanyahu wants to continue because he wants to remain in power and he wants trump to get elected. This has been very clear from the start.

Biden and Harris's hands are tied because they will see more revolt from democrats and independents if they stop sending arms to Israel, but Netanyahu is gleefully killing Palestinians because he gets to throw one stone for two birds.

I would like to see them pointing out how “illegals” pay taxes and yet don’t receive the same benefits. I would like to see them pointing out that lack of immigration is causing countries like Japan to go into crisis as their aging population is not replenishing the workforce. I would like to see them more often point out how “illegal” immigration is a relatively new thing in our still young country and that many Americans ancestors came over when the border was effectively open and that led to incredible influxes of talent in the innovation gene pool.

His unqualified support of Israel has damaged my perception of his presidency severely, but you can’t honestly say anyone who has held the office to date would not have done the same, so he still ranks among the best when we’re speaking in relative terms.

Religious ideas imposed on non religious people. They want to tell people who they can marry, yet time and time again they turn out to be closeted homosexuals, awkward. 

They do on the other hand want to keep government from protecting you and your family from large corporations that poison the water and the food and the land but that would require critical thinking skills.

"If it doesn't matter, then why not spend 10 minutes to drive to the polls? Worst thing that can happen is losing 10 minutes.

By the way, I do not agree with you that it doesn't matter. Because Trump was president in 2016, he chose three Catholic supreme court justices that took away a woman's right to choose what happens to her body. A new woman dies every day because doctors in Texas and other states can no longer perform an abortion if a pregnancy puts a woman's life in danger. Here's one ~~that died~~ that was reported on yesterday. She had a miscarriage and because Trump was elected, doctors had to watch her die because they could not legally act to save her life.

I just really hope you, your family or friends don’t die because of the conservatives fucked up ideas. In order to prevent women dying you need to vote for Kamala. If you don’t want to vote then don’t. It’s your choice. Just hope it doesn’t turn out to be a bad one.

"I could write a thousand words covering all of that, but I’ll just pick “losing Roe” without pushback. 

The president has no authority to overrule the Supreme Court. However, the DOJ under Biden established a Reproductive Rights Task Force to  find legal ways around state abortion bans. 

For example, in 2022, they “obtained a preliminary injunction blocking the enforcement of Idaho’s total ban on abortion as applied to medical care required by EMTALA.” 

Here’s an overview of actions they’ve taken to protect reproductive healthcare access:
https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/fact-sheet-justice-department-efforts-protect-reproductive-rights-health-and-justice

So if you’re upset about Roe/Dobbs, then blame the Republicans in Congress who are the reason we don’t have laws passed that protect access to reproductive rights. Democrats would pass them in a second.

Higher taxes and increased regulation often harm growth and innovation, leading to less investment and fewer jobs. The evidence shows that Trumps approach is better for driving domestic growth

"That's my point though, at the time there were more people than not that felt the same way as she did.  Not to say it's right, of course, just to say that was the mores of the day.


There's a scene in the movie Lincoln that shows this, a couple of people are brought in and asked how the felt about abolition, and they agreed that the slaves needed to be freed to win the civil war...but when pressed on whether they supported equal rights for those freed slaves, they immediately balked.


If all those people had taken the stance ""freedom without equal rights is pointless"" then slavery would have persisted.  I'm betting that women's suffrage would have suffered the same fate, had people taken the modern stance you espouse.


I'm not saying they're right or you're wrong, of course, I'm just saying that casting judgment on someone who existed hundreds of years before you did, based on the modalities of today, is a fools errand.  Context is important.  We can laud someone for being more progressive than others of their own time, even if they weren't progressive enough by today's standards.  If we can't, then we need to be prepared to be considered monsters in 200 years just the same and that just doesn't seem right to me.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

Susan Anthony lobbied very hard for most of her activist life for the rights of black people for full citizenship rights including the right to vote.   She worked along side abolitionists and other more forward thinking people at a time when it would have very unpopular to do so.

> A video purporting to show recently arrived Haitian immigrants illegally voting in Georgia for Kamala Harris was produced by a Russian government-backed disinformation unit, according to US authorities.

> Though the agencies didn&#039;t specifically name a particular source for the videos, disinformation experts, including Darren Linvill of Clemson University, pointed out that the voting video strongly resembles earlier ones produced by Storm-1516, a Russian government-backed propaganda unit that has been targeting the Harris-Walz campaign for months.

> While AlphaFox78&#039;s post has been deleted, screenshots of the video are still spreading widely on X. &quot;This Russian activity is part of Moscow&#039;s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the US election and stoke divisions among Americans,&quot; the intelligence agencies wrote.

>Hundreds of thousands of people showed up to protect this place and to hold moderate Democrats accountable, and that was the key to victory here.

>***You know who didn’t show up for this place? Jill Stein. She doesn’t show up for these frontline battles. Ever.***

>*Stein says she’s against fracking, but Stein has hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in the oil and gas industry. Did you know that? Did you know that she actually profits off of the oil and gas industry, that she has had investments in the Keystone XL pipeline and multiple fracking companies?*

>*Did you know that she has investments in Raytheon, that she’s had investments in ExxonMobil? Did you know that she has investments in Home Depot—one of the most rapacious companies in the world, guilty of horrific deforestation throughout the world?*

>*How is it that the Green Party candidate hasn’t divested her own personal fortune from fossil fuels? It’s sheer hypocrisy. And so is the strategy of running for president every four years but never showing up for battles like this.*

>*In 2016, Stein defended these investments by saying they are mutual funds and indexed retirement funds.*

>*But that, plainly speaking, is bunk.*

>*Her claims are a slap in the face to the entire fossil fuel divestment movement. It is easier now than ever to have investments that are fossil free; doing so is a huge plank of the environmental cause. Hundreds of real activists were arrested this summer in New York City calling for Citibank to divest as part of the Summer of Heat campaign. For Stein to ignore all this and still attempt to call herself an activist is beyond hypocrisy, it is political malpractice. Shame on you, Dr. Stein! Shame on you for profiting from fracking and oil drilling.*

"Multiple parts.

Part 1

""Progressives can truly win in this election, even though we have a moderate Democrat on the ticket. And it’s not by voting for Jill Stein. But first, a little history…

Not long ago the entire upper Delaware River basin in Pennsylvania—one of the most beautiful areas in the country, in the watershed for New York City, southern New Jersey and Philadelphia—was on the chopping block for fracking.

A 75 mile stretch of the Delaware River could have become a toxic oil field. Fracking is an environmental apocalypse: millions of gallons of toxic fracking fluids, radioactive waste, underground water contamination, hundreds of thousands of truck trips, air pollution, land scarring, massive public health crises, and depleted water supply. Everything about the practice is toxic; it is inherently contaminating in the long and short term.

Our community was quick to understand the threat and organize and mobilize against it. Every little town along the Delaware across New York and Pennsylvania had a mom-and-pop anti-fracking group spring up. My film Gasland, on HBO, was part of this campaign, and our Gasland tours went from town to town, Johnny Appleseed–style, fostering our new movement.

Amazingly, we won. We banned fracking in the Delaware River basin and in New York State, saving the water supply for 16 million people. One of the greatest achievements of the environmental movement in this century.

We did this by convincing the Democratic governors of New York and Delaware and the president at the time—Barack Obama—to ban fracking here. These were all moderate Democrats. Not exactly Bernie Sanders, if you know what I mean.

Republicans would have just said no. This whole place would have been completely fracked to hell. We would have lost. And the whole gorgeous, life-giving national treasure of the Delaware River would have been a toxic fracking zone.

Our victory against fracking kept more carbon and methane in the ground than almost any other single environmental win in history—making it a huge win for the climate as well.""",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"Part 2 of 2

""Here is the key point: I’m not in love with Kamala Harris’s positions on fracking. I find it utterly infuriating when moderate Democrats think that they need to pay lip service to a toxic destructive climate monster of an industry to win Pennsylvania. I don’t actually think that is true, because studies have shown that 70 percent of Pennsylvania residents want fracking either banned or much more tightly regulated.

But I don’t need to be in love. I need to be able to vote strategically.

Hundreds of thousands of people showed up to protect this place and to hold moderate Democrats accountable, and that was the key to victory here.

*You know who didn’t show up for this place? Jill Stein. She doesn’t show up for these frontline battles. Ever.*

*Stein says she’s against fracking, but Stein has hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in the oil and gas industry. Did you know that? Did you know that she actually profits off of the oil and gas industry, that she has had investments in the Keystone XL pipeline and multiple fracking companies?*

*Did you know that she has investments in Raytheon, that she’s had investments in ExxonMobil? Did you know that she has investments in Home Depot—one of the most rapacious companies in the world, guilty of horrific deforestation throughout the world?*

*How is it that the Green Party candidate hasn’t divested her own personal fortune from fossil fuels? It’s sheer hypocrisy. And so is the strategy of running for president every four years but never showing up for battles like this.*

*In 2016, Stein defended these investments by saying they are mutual funds and indexed retirement funds.*

*But that, plainly speaking, is bunk.*

*Her claims are a slap in the face to the entire fossil fuel divestment movement. It is easier now than ever to have investments that are fossil free; doing so is a huge plank of the environmental cause. Hundreds of real activists were arrested this summer in New York City calling for Citibank to divest as part of the Summer of Heat campaign. For Stein to ignore all this and still attempt to call herself an activist is beyond hypocrisy, it is political malpractice. Shame on you, Dr. Stein! Shame on you for profiting from fracking and oil drilling.*

I’m not in love with Kamala Harris’s positions—on fracking, and on some other issues. But I will tell you what I am in love with. I’m in love with our movements.

I’m in love with what we can do. The entire history of progressive progress in this country is of movements pushing moderate presidents. It happened with FDR and the labor movement. It happened with LBJ and the MLK and the civil rights movement. It happened with Obama and Biden and the movement for gay marriage. We organize and push them—and that’s how we get what we want. That’s our progressive history in America.

But in order for us progressives to do our jobs and fight effectively for a more just and equitable world as a movement, we need to have Harris in office. If we have Donald Trump in office, there’s no chance in hell that we’re actually going to advance an environmental agenda.

So I urge you to please believe in us as a movement. Love us. Believe in our power. We have done this before—and we can do it again with a moderate Democrat in office. Which is the only choice we’ve got right now.

If everyone in who voted for Stein in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan had voted for the Democrat instead, Trump would never have been the president.

We have the true power. It comes from the bottom up.

And I believe in us.

A vote for Harris is a vote for us, a vote for our movements to have a fighting chance for change. Progressive politics and advancing our agenda in this country is not something that happens every four years when you vote, or every four years when a toxic egomaniac like Stein (or Trump, for that matter) runs for president. It is a daily commitment. So vote for Kamala Harris. Join the movement—and I’ll see you on the front lines.""",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"> even though we have a moderate Democrat on the ticket.

who?

Harris was a senator that voted to the left of Bernie

And ran on Medicare4All in the 2020 primary

She's not wasting political capital on it right now, but if she gets a Dem majority in the House and Senate she will be more supportive than actual 'moderate' Democrts",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"*Does she really care about the environment?*

Or is a big (or only) part of what she's doing just about the money and her own agenda?

I say she invests in gas and oil because she doesn't give a rat's you know what about the environment...

I mean, it's mind boggling that someone who claims to be part of the GREEN party would

invest in those things that hurt our environment. *I can't stand people and want to live*

*on an island with cats and dogs and squirrels and birds*😂",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"I think his point is that she recently said she would NOT ban fracking. But who knows?

Also, in case you missed the below?

He labeled journalists covering his rally “monsters,” mocked trans people, and called his opponent a product of political correctness and “stupid,” with a racist and sexist subtext hard to miss.

Still annoyed this story isn't more widespread.  Wolff is a jackass for sitting on it for so long - and any news organization is going to want to vet the heck out of this since Wolff is not the most reliable source.,2024_11_03,05_39_46
">According to Wolff, Epstein had placed a bid on a house in Palm Beach, Florida, for around $36 million and asked Trump for advice about moving the property's swimming pool. The former president is then said to have ""gone around Epstein's back"" and bid $40 million for the house, said Wolff.

>""Epstein knew that Trump didn't have the money, therefore Epstein's conclusion was that he must be fronting for someone,"" Wolff said.

>""And in fact, in that classic money laundering setup, Trump bought the house for $40 million, bought it through borrowed money, and then the house was put on the market not long afterward and immediately sold for $96 million to one of the oligarchs in the close [Russian President Vladimir] Putin circle.""",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"Well, at least Wolff released it to the general press and not to . . . whoever the Democratic equivalent of Giuliani (I still feel like the latter was illegal).

But again, the timing is ridiculous - If had been a month ago, it could have been vetted - it's an audio recording, or at least a lot of it is, so all that would have to be confirmed was that it wasn't modified.  But there's no reasonable time to do that at this point.

Edit: I've been corrected - Wolff only released some short snippets on his podcast.  He did not - so near as I am aware - provide any material to a real news outlet.  Coming through a secondary news source, it will likely be a bit harder to check the audio for modification (it's would have been compressed).  What's there is certainly not pretty - but really, if they guy wanted to be a legitimate reporter rather than a podcaster, he could have done this broadcast a month ago, then provided the tapes to MSM, and probably gotten a lot of mileage out of it.

So yeah, I'm starting to see why MSM sources might be wary of this.  Heck, I don't even think MSMBC has picked the story up.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"I’ll be overly fair here: if I thought I wanted the most impact from these tapes in real life, *right now* is when you do it. Right on time for Election Day, not enough time to properly dissect them. I’m not saying that is what Wolff is doing. I’m not giving him the benefit of the doubt (edit to add: especially without hearing more). But… I actually think the timing would be impeccable from a damage caused standpoint. Even better than the Comey Letter was.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

>For Trump, Tuesday is judgment day.

>“He branded himself as the guy who gets away with it,” said [Gwenda Blair](https://journalism.columbia.edu/directory/gwenda-linda-blair), a Trump biographer, adding that, should he lose, “he is facing a lot of moments of reckoning. He could go to jail. He could end up considerably less wealthy than he is*.* No matter what happens, and no matter whether he wins or loses, there will be a reckoning over his health. Death, ill health, dementia – those are things even he can’t escape.”

>The property developer and reality TV star has spent his career pushing ethical and legal boundaries to the limit, facing countless investigations, court battles and hefty fines. Worthy of a novel, his has been [a life of scandal on a gargantuan scale](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/trump-scandals.html).

>In the 1970s Trump and his father were sued by the justice department for [racial discrimination](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html) after refusing to rent apartments to Black people in predominantly white buildings. His property and casino businesses, including the Taj Mahal and Trump Plaza, filed for bankruptcy several times in the 1990s and early 2000s.

>[Trump University](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/06/trump-university-court-upholds-25m-settlement-to-give-students-money-back), a business offering property training courses, faced multiple lawsuits for fraud, misleading marketing and false claims about the quality of its programmes. In 2016 Trump settled for $25m without admitting wrongdoing.

>The Donald J Trump Foundation, a charitable organisation, was investigated and sued for allegedly using charitable funds for personal and business expenses. Trump eventually agreed to dissolve the foundation with remaining funds going to charity.

>Trump and his company were ordered to pay more than $350m in [a New York civil fraud trial](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/16/donald-trump-financial-fraud-case) for artificially inflating his net worth to secure favourable loan terms. He is also known to have paid little to no federal income taxes in specific years which, although technically legal, was seen by some as bordering on unethical.

>But Trump became a fixture of the New York tabloids and hosted his own reality TV show, [The Apprentice](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364782/). Blair added: “His early realisation was that if you get famous, if you get large, people will get out of the way. He spent the first part of his career as a real estate developer, making himself seem the embodiment of enormous tycoon-level success even though, in fact, many things he did weren’t successful and his father kept bailing him out.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"While I agree Trump has no place near the White House, I disagree that being a felon should disqualify you from office. 

First, it opens up a very real possibility of politically motivated charges and convictions to remove your opponents from running. Obviously, opponents can still be charged and convicted, but now can at least run again once out of prison. 

Secondly, we have to be hopeful that someone found guilty of a crime 20, 30, maybe 40 years ago has reformed and their record doesn’t reflect who they are now. Actually, the fact they served time, and experienced the other side of the legal system may bring a valuable perspective. Maybe they are running on a criminal justice reform platform. 

Ultimately, it should be up to the populace to decide if the criminal history is a positive, negative, or neutral factor in a candidate’s profile. And THAT is where WE’VE failed this time.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"It's a super tense and careful situation to manage.

Any action will look like an attack from MAGA's perspective, they're conditioned to it.

First, for the matter of fact, the news media and social media need to be reigned right the fuck in. News media needs to be neutered, it's one thing to claim free speech but it's another to do whatever the fuck this is. The integrity is non-existent and plays only to be a mouthpiece for the billionaire owners. National security should not be a sacrifice for profits. Then there's the factor of just the amount of wealth who have been supporting Trump. They've unionized themselves of course and have for decades. I figure they're holding that as security that they don't get targetted. But I don't think the nation will be satisfied until the super public facing ones are arrested.

Then what do you do to deal with the actual people? They have established themselves as terrorist organizations but they don't exist in a vacuum. They're well connected with police insiders, military connections. The only way to get rid of them is to blitz them in one foul swoop so not to trigger some kind of domino scenario.. But that's a nigh impossible task.

The world is watching too, of course. Much of what happens in America gets felt in ripples in other countries. There's an anticipation in the air, like, well what if Russia makes moves to incite something bigger in their disinformation agenda? They've already got plenty hooked. The war they started is being fought on the international battlefront right now via the internet.. It's looking really fucking bad right now because plenty of nations are contending with their own MAGA idiots too.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

> Elon Musk&#039;s troubled canvassing operation on behalf of Donald Trump and the Republican party is now facing a lawsuit in southern California filed by two women who say they were cheated out of wages and expenses as they knocked on doors for an embattled Republican congresswoman.

> The suit accuses Musk&#039;s America PAC, which has poured more than $100m into this year&#039;s election campaign, of &quot;Willful violations of the California labor code&quot; by paying the plaintiffs less than it promised and refusing to make up the difference.

> Musk&#039;s Pac is one of several named defendants in the suit, along with a hiring and payroll company, Liberty Staffing Services; a national canvassing company, the Blair Group; and Representative Michelle Steel&#039;s re-election campaign.

I'm not surprised the early voting is more evenly split this year, with Trump actively pushing to get out early, with many Democrats waiting for in person because it's harder to interfere with their vote (or at least, that's the narrative).

I'd find it hilarious if Texas flipped blue, but I'll still be truly happy to let it go to Trump so long as Allred kicks out Cruz (and Harris wins through other states).

To your point about money, part of it is that the financial map let Dems hit a lot of spots that Republicans usually didn't have to defend, and that outsourcing ground operations to Musk seems to have been a disaster - meaning more money had to go from GOP coughers to trying to support some sort of ground game.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

>A running concern for Milley was the prospect of Trump pushing the nation into a military conflict with Iran. He saw this as a real threat, in part because of a meeting with the President in the early months of 2020, at which one of Trump’s advisers raised the prospect of taking military action to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons if Trump were to lose the election. At another meeting, at which Trump was not present, some of the President’s foreign-policy advisers again pushed military action against Iran. Milley later said that, when he asked why they were so intent on attacking Iran, Vice-President Mike Pence replied, “Because they are evil.”

>Military members are not, however, absolved of moral responsibility simply because orders are within the limits of the law, for they also take an oath to “support and defend” and to “bear true faith and allegiance” to the Constitution.

>On June 2, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff – the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the U.S. military – went so far as to issue a service-wide memo reminding troops of that oath, one that may well be at odds with what the president may order them to do if he were to send them back into U.S. cities.

And eventually, you have to play the strategy game just like the rest of us all are too.

"I fully agree, and personally I feel there is strong reason to hope. Right now I get people want concrete action, but she really has no power in the Biden administration and we know that man is beyond all reason on Israel, so how's she supposed to force him? Spike his coffee and start a coup? As for speaking out, I mean she's careful not to scare the boomers but has still been dropping not-so-subliminals *constantly* since Biden stepped down... it was literally the first thing she did, which is wild already, and she's only got more vocal since.

Remember when the party brass refused access for the Uncommitted Movement on Gaza during the DNC nomination, and also threw those hard Israeli Nationalists on stage as an extra fuck you? Kamala made damn clear that was a DNC choice, not her own, and that they don't get to speak for her new administration -- she personally invited the protest organizers to meet face-to-face, and lent her own voice to speak up on stage in their stead (they *still* declined her meeting, claiming it was just to buy their silence... but I think that's a drastic mis-read and lost opportunity, like a speech is nice but this woman is offering a private ear and working relationship with the hopefully-soon *most powerful person on the damn planet*). 

As for the DNC speeches themselves, the furthest left voices on that stage Bernie and AOC both gave just the bearest half-sentence of ""ceasefire & hostages please"",  but Kamala went on for fully 4 paragraphs -- like, that is a *choice*, she obviously cares... it wasn't all perfect, but damn sure she took pains on that stage to humanize Palestinian suffering in a way I don't think I've heard from a major politician *ever*. 

Remember, this election is already horrifically close without her alienating  90% of mass media along with the biggest most electorally engaged voting bloc in the nation (centrist boomers, sucks I know but somehow young leftists who mostly refuse to vote anyway didn't quite make the cut). And yet still she has constantly shown support in every way that isn't (arguably) political suicide... I really don't understand the expectation for her to spell this out for people any more obviously than she already has. 

For sure, having to read between the lines can be crazy-making, like interpreting tea leaves... but I can't really fault her playing strategically with the whole damn world at stake. Would I play everything the same in her position, hell no, but if we in the US refuse to even consider the one greatest ally we have on this (or possibly *ever will* have, if the other one gets in)...  well, to any voters reading, I don't think any of us get to wash our hands of this just because we chose to sit it out.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

The complete systematic and intentional destruction of civilian infrastructure, including the complete destruction of their healthcare system, educational institutions, and water and sanitation, along with blockades that have and are causing mass starvation, and forced displacement of most of the population, meets some definitions of genocide.

There is reasonable debate to be had about the specifics because there is not one solitary definition and it also requires some evaluation that is hard to do while the war is going on and third party access to Gaza is severely limited, but it is clearly close enough.

"The person I responded to deleted their comment, but I spent time writing this up so I will post it anyway.

>Yes, based on that explanation you are using that word incorrectly lol. “Close enough” (in your opinion) doesn’t give you carte blanche to spew ugly misinfo unchallenged. You’re posting stupid nonsense online in a public forum, expect to get a response back.

I only said close enough to leave room for nuance. I believe it does meet the definition of genocide, as do many. Thanks for trying to use my attempt at being nuanced against me though.

>It’s wildly irresponsible to just lightly throw out a loaded word like “genocide”; all you’re doing is engaging in “Holocaust inversion” and attempting to justify the extreme actions of Islamist terrorists by fabricating a false narrative.

I am not lightly using this word and it's insane that you are accusing me of attempting to justify terrorism by calling out the complete destruction of an entire society. One atrocity does not justify another, especially one that is orders of magnitude larger in the scope of destruction and death.

>The primary reason infrastructure in Gaza has been hit so hard is because A) it’s a war and Gaza is small, and B) Hamas has been using civilian objects as military sites. According to international law, this means they are no longer civilian objects. I’m sorry that you don’t seem to understand this.

66% of infrastructure in Gaza is not being used as military sites. 100% of the Gazan healthcare system is not being used as military sites. And international law does not allow for the complete destruction of a society's infrastructure because some of it may be used by Hamas. You quote international law but then ignore the fact that the UN has accused Israel of committing crimes against humanity due to their attacks on infrastructure: [https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/10/un-commission-finds-war-crimes-and-crimes-against-humanity-israeli-attacks](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/10/un-commission-finds-war-crimes-and-crimes-against-humanity-israeli-attacks)

You can't have it both ways. Either you care about international law or you don't.

>Even so, Israel still warns civilians ahead of time with mass text alerts, roof knocks, and fliers w/ evac routes.

This doesn't do much good when so much of the infrastructure is destroyed that you reach a point that there is nowhere left to go.

>Additionally, 20% of Israel is Arab, many of whom are descended from these same people. Israel is not rounding these people up and exterminating them, further disproving your claim.

This is not a requirement to be considered genocide. The definition according to the Geneva Convention: *""In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:*

*Killing members of the group;*

*Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;*

*Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;*

*Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;*

*Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.""*

Note, it is any of the following with the intent to destroy the group in whole, or part.

It does not require the destruction of 100% of an ethnic group. What is happening in Gaza meets all these definitions except the last one. The intent can be established by many statements from those associated with or in the government itself, as well as various plans, both made public, such as the Generals Plan, and leaked, such as the concept plan to push Gazans into Egypt.

I'd also draw attention to this: [https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/edge-gaza-israeli-settlers-applaud-thud-artillery-fire](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/edge-gaza-israeli-settlers-applaud-thud-artillery-fire)

>Every war in existence is a “humanitarian crisis” btw, but no, the famine rumor has already been debunked. COGAT delivers aid every day, Hamas just pilfers it.

""Trust me bro"". The United States, who has been the closest partner of Israel during this, sent a letter accusing them of blocking aid, and this is not the first time. So are they lying then? Is everyone lying but Israel?

>The blockades exist because since Day 1, Hamas has sworn to destroy Israel, and has fired rockets and incendiary balloons over the border to accomplish this goal, while brainwashing their citizenry into militants for the past 18 years. Plz read an actual book. My god, man.

If she gets voted out and her old district is won by Dems. Colorado will add two Democratic Representatives to Congress. Go Colorado Go!,2024_11_03,05_39_46
">“I don’t appreciate, as a Christian, people saying they’re Christian to get your vote and then turning out to be a lowlife, and now I just kind of think of her as a lowlife,” one voter told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. While some Republicans said they’d hold their nose, despite Boebert’s “antics,” just to avoid voting for the Democrat, that may not be the case for everyone. 

But still gonna vote for Trump, who pretends at religion so poorly it is laughable. Boebert could *host* a weekly gang-bang on the church lawn and still be more Biblically literate and *Christian* than Trump and his Two Corinthians^^TM, repeated adultery and constant malicious lies. Their *imperfect vessel* is a chamber pot.

I voted against her and I just convinced my coworker to as well,2024_11_03,05_39_46
"Boebert doing the Lord's work. Turning deep red House Districts into Democratic Congressional Seats.

She fled CO-03, an R+8 district after holding it by only 500 votes in the ""red wave"" election of 2022. Her neighbours literally held a street party to celebrate. Her family had terrorised them for years.

Carpetbagged over to CO-04, an R+14 district and her bizarre and extreme behaviours may shift that too.

I mean, who would have thought that conservative rural folk are conservative. Boebert too gross and extreme for them.

I'm excited. Though, TBH, +14 districts never flip, that math don't math. It's Electoral Science. Boebert is a miracle worker doing the Lord's work. I'm praying for her.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"Nothing would make me happier than seeing ""bobo the handjob clown"" lose her race.  I've said this before but it bares repeating.  Bobo is not, in any way, representative of the real people of Colorado.  She's an embarrassment to herself, her family and our entire state.  At no point, in her entire public life did she do ANYTHING actually helpful for her district.  This woman is a trashy narcissists, criminal and a sociopath.

To her and her orange jebus savior, this is all just a reality TV show where they can get rich by embracing the WORST aspects of our society.  They don't, and will not, ever care about their fellow people.  The playbook is so tiresome at this point.  Find any reason to manufacture cultural war, lie about it as loud as you can, flame the fans of distrust among the most vulnerable people in our country.  Rince and fucking repeat.

What she is alleging is totally insane.  Nobody's going drive all across town all day giving fake names.  It's absurd on its face.  Say they do take your fake names.  They'll also ask for your address.  They're then going to check if you actually exist.  If you don't, your vote won't count, and if they find out who you really are (there are cameras everywhere and there's a good chance they can link to to a car license plate), you will go to prison.

"It's NY.

You either show proof of identification (a valid SS# or driver's license or other form of unique ID) when you register to vote, or you show it at your polling place when you go to vote. You still have to provide the state with some form of identification at some step in the process.

You report to the specific polling place your local board of elections has assigned to you, which has a list of all registered voters in the precinct, and your name and signature (given either when you get your driver's license in NY, or when you register to vote) are checked against records when you go to vote to ensure no one votes multiple times and no one votes under someone elses' name/identity.

There are plenty of safeguards in place against the type of fraud she seemed to enjoy fantasizing about, without requiring someone to have a specific piece of ID on their person at the time of voting.",2024_11_03,05_39_46
"many states do not require an ID. but the vote is tied to your address that you are registered to. if there are multiple votes by someone of the same name at the same address, it gets caught. if you tried to vote and give an address you are not registered at, you will not get a ballot.

well, you might get a provisional ballot, but unless you are mentally incapacitated in some way (say, 90s and possibly senile), it will get caught and something will come of it. 

even though US elections are locally run, there s a lot of steps in place to prevent voter fraud. stuffing ballots is a thing of the past. 

as a side note, the only way voter ID would work in the US would be if it is both free and required. AKA a national ID card, which has long been seen as unwanted and arguably now unnecessary. But once national ID cards became possible, it was seen by many quarters as ""papers"" that could be used to restrict travel like in the soviet union or under the nazis. the closest the US probably came to it was the Clinton proposed national health ID for the failed national health insurance legislation, which all but certainly would have resulted in everyone getting an ID card of some kind (or be signed up for one at a hospital visit).",2024_11_03,05_39_46

Edit :  
>Many of Trump’s former White House staffers, cabinet secretaries and commanding generals are frantically attempting to warn against his madness, that he is “a fascist to the core”, as former chairman of the joint chiefs Gen Mark Milley has unequivocally stated. In private conversation, former staffers and others with intimate knowledge of Trump, all reliable people, talk about the real man as far viler than those who haven’t seen him behind closed doors could possibly know.

>Knowledge of Trump’s vileness is widespread among top-level Republicans. “They all hate him,” a former senior Trump adviser told me categorically. And they all have stories, some exhibiting his narcissism, others his malice: how, for example, the time two senators from one state were summoned to the Oval Office to listen to Trump say he would travel there to have a mountain named after him. As a rule, they agree with Senator Mitch McConnell that he is “despicable”. Unlike those former Trump staffers waving their arms, they are silent and complicit.

>Now, former staffers speculate about the hazy fine line between Trump’s infantilism and his dementia. There is no responsible person left around Trump. He has learned the lesson, sealed by January 6, not to trust the “normies”.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

"As usual, these types of things have a sand grain of truth in them, and then they are encased in a pearl of crazy. Stick with me guys. 

Fluoride in the drinking water should not be removed, but much more strictly regulated. 

We started putting it in our water due to apparent health benefits such as teeth health, due to tests performed with 100% pure lab created medical grade fluoride. 

That is NOT what goes into your drinking water at home. 

Fluoride is a by product of many industrial metal production, did you know that? 

Fluoride additives contain metal contaminants that must be diluted to meet drinking water regulations. However, each raw additive batch supplied to water facilities does not come labeled with concentrations per contaminant. This omission distorts exposure profiles and the risks associated with accidents and routine use.

Local governments purchase this for their water supplies from various industrial companies. It's NOT the same as what was used as testing justification to make this nationwide policy. And so, it very may be the case that adding ""fluoride"" as its managed today is a bad thing. Good policy based on good science but implemented with poor execution. It's basically super diluted waste water from steel foundries coming out of your sink. Yes there's fluoride, but there's other stuff too. 

The podcast ""Stuff You Should Know"" has a great episode on this. 

An article on the topic: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4090869/

Oh, and its a bit of a dramatic way to say it, but fluoride really does ""turn the frogs gay"". It messes with their sex determination processes in their development cycle. Like I said - a lot of the dumbass conspiracies are based on a grain of truth. 

TLDR: Fluoride is fine, but in the quest of doing things as cheaply as possible, we put a lot more than just fluoride in our water, and also regulate it poorly.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

>Moreover, fluoride itself may be dangerous at high levels. Excessive   
fluoride causes fluorosis—changes in tooth enamel that range from barely  
 noticeable white spots to staining and pitting. Fluoride can also   
become concentrated in bone—stimulating bone cell growth, altering the   
tissue’s structure, and weakening the skeleton.  
Perhaps most worrisome is preliminary research in laboratory animals   
suggesting that high levels of fluoride may be toxic to brain and nerve   
cells. And human epidemiological studies have identified possible links   
to learning, memory, and cognition deficits, though most of these   
studies have focused on populations with fluoride exposures higher than   
those typically provided by U.S. water supplies.",2024_11_03,05_39_46

The National Guard will be activated from Nov. 4 to 7 until just after midnight, according to the release. The adjutant general will determine how many members of the Guard will be called.
