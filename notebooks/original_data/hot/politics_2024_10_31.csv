"This is the uphill battle we face with MAGA:

A MAGA family member (I barely talk to) fully believes Harris wants to switch OTC drugs to requiring a prescription so that Big Pharma can charge more and that the only person that will fix Big Pharma is Trump.

This despite the fact that under Biden, hearing aids now have OTC options and no longer require a prescription all the time.

"I'm a Catholic, and my priest gave us the annual election schpiel at the end of last Sunday's mass about how this election is about voting for the lesser of two evils. He didn't come out and say vote for Trump, but he did say that only one candidate is for protecting the right of the unborn and to keep that in mind when we we're filling out our ballot. With that being said, I guess my choice is easy. I have to ""vote for the lesser of two evils,"". This is why I will be voting for Kamala Harris on election day. 

There needs to be a separation of church and state in this country. I don't want the government to get involved in my faith, and my faith should not try to get involved in government business. On a faithful level, I don't agree with abortion. At the same time, I do feel women should have autonomy over their own bodies. Women should be allowed to get pregnant without the fear of dying during pregnancy just because they can't get the proper health care. Or if they are raped they should have the opportunity to seek an abortion. Who am I to say you can't do this or that with your body just because it goes against my faith. 

A lot of Catholics and Christians demonize women who get abortions. They think they are monsters who get an abortion just on a whim. When in reality, that's no the case. It's a deep personal and emotional decision. If it's truly wrong in God's eyes, then he will be the judge in the end, but we as Catholics should not try to regulate what someone does with their body. At the same time, Trump is the complete opposite of what the Bible teaches, and I wish more Catholics and Christians would realize this.",2024_10_31

I said ""Look, I get it. Maybe you don't like her personality. Democrats have a problem of nominating really really smart people with deep experience but not much in the way of personality. For every Bill Clinton or Obama, there are more Al Gores and John Kerrys and Hillary Clintons and Joe Bidens with personalities which just seem to turn people off. But which one is going to surround themselves with the better people and which one has the stronger moral compass? That's what you need in a President. Not someone to micromanage whether gas is 2.99 or 3.19.""",2024_10_31

"So because I had a bit of time and I enjoy stats, I thought I would have a look at the cross tabs of the recent Fox News, CNN, CBS and Redfield and Wilton polls that all had PA tied.

In terms of party id (care, this is self defined and may be different to how they are actually registered) the polls showed in % (D/R/I)

Fox News.  44/46/10. Lean R+2

CNN 34/38/28. Lean R+4

CBS 31/33/34 Lean R+2

The Redfield one was very difficult to get to the cross tabs but best I can read it is R+3.

Now, there is nothing wrong with an R lean as such. The pollsters, like Generals are fighting the last war and trying to account for Trumps over performance in previous polling.

But riddle me this…all of them have weighted their polls with difference mixes that then just happen to come to an exact tie? It is, if nothing else, a heck of a coincidence.

Just for comparison, the Atlas sample that had Trump up 2.7% has a R lean of +5. It also interestingly has the sample breakdown of White 75.0%, Black 2.2%, Hispanic 14.7%, Asian 2.3% and Other 5.8%.",2024_10_31

She was responding to a story about Amazon donating $2.7 million to Seattle-area schools, and the second half of that tweet said ""I'm so sick of corporate 'philanthropy'. It's a PR sham.""

So not only was she responding to a story about a city on the opposite coast, but she was telling a *corporation* to pay taxes to the cities they operate in, instead of occasionally make a charitable donation. It wasn't directed at *people*, but the ad presents it like it was.

Wednesday night, he told a Wisconsin crowd he wants to ""protect the women of our country,"" and, ""I'm gonna do it whether the women like it or not.""

All the messages and rallies since have been staged to serve 2 purposes.

> Women are dominating early voting in the 2024 election so far, prompting concern among some of former President Donald Trump&#039;s allies.

> While it is not known how women who have cast ballots early have voted, the data is worrying supporters of Trump who fear it may indicate he will not be able to win in November.

> It is not known if the increased turnout among women is only beneficial for Harris since Trump has seen success in his recent calls for Republicans to cast their ballots ahead of Election Day, after previously attacking all forms of early voting.

Think about it. Everything has been going downhill since then, and the Republican Party has gotten more and more extreme since then. 

Assuming history books continue to exist, they’ll put 2010 as one of the most consequential elections in the nation’s history. If Democrats win in 2010, they keep their state level advantage and the House. With more favorable maps, the Democrats hold onto the Senate instead of losing it in 2014. With control of the Senate, Obama is able to replace Scalia with a liberal justice, giving the liberals the majority on the Supreme Court. Not to mention by holding onto majorities in both chambers of Congress, Obama’s agenda wouldn’t have been cut short halfway through his first term, and he might have been able to pass even more reforms in healthcare, finance, and education. With more reforms and legislative successes to run on, Democrat turnout in the 2016 election would have been much higher, and a Democrat would have succeeded Obama instead of Trump. With that, we get even more liberal justices on the SCOTUS and all through the federal courts. The pandemic response team wouldn’t have been disbanded, so even COVID may have played out _much_ differently. And of course, Roe v Wade remains intact.

Instead, the left sat out the 2010 election, and the opposite of everything I just said unfurled. And it will take literal decades of record voter turnout from the left to even start undoing the damage.",2024_10_31

I still felt that if people felt comfort and believing helped them in their life, that was fine and they could do their thing and I would do mine.

But as I've seen how absolutely vile some of the loud Christians are, I've changed my mind.  I'm more in line with the French view of laicity - religion should be personal and *private.* Want to pray?  Fine, do it silently and don't expect everyone else to wait for you or join in.  Want to go to church on Sunday?  Fine, but don't expect any sort of special treatment because of your piety.  Want to read the Bible?  Fine, just don't try to force everyone else to treat your book as special just because you like it.

It was a shock to me as well, but not necessarily because I thought she would win, rather that so many people didn't see Trump for the wannabe dictator that he is. 

I can't tell you how many people I spoke to who were VERY begrudging votes for Clinton. Like... Looking for any possible excuses not to vote for her. Her good polling didn't help the situation. People felt comfortable withholding their vote for her because ""she was going to win anyways"". 

This time around, it feels very different. There's excitement to vote for Harris. There's a buzz in the air. People aren't going ""well I don't like her, but I feel obligated to vote for her"".. they're actually happy to do so.

We welcome yours and your family's votes to keep that horrible person away from the levers of power, as well as his party, while it still has a taste for American Fascism.

This is when you *persuade* and *move* the electorate that progressive policies are the BEST thing to do. Not when in campaign mode when you must meet them where they're at to win.

And so in this respect, I propose to emphasize 2 things:

**1) Campaign Finance / Election Reform** 

- Abolish Electoral College
- Abolish FPTP for something such as Approval or STAR voting 
- Overturn Citizens United and SpeechNow decisions.
- Crack down on foreign influence on our elections (laundering, SuperPAC engagement, foreign lobbyists such as AIPAC).
- Implement Publicly Funded Elections (or a Clean Elections model)

**2) Education on Critical-Thinking and Navigating Media**

- Teach Americans how to spot Formal and Informal fallacies in news & opinion.
- Give Americans a rubric for distinguishing truly Fake news from Real News. 


Like I want to see ads that *inform*; speeches that teach. Adopt the Katie Porter style of engaging the electorate with a whiteboard.

"Here's a link to their full endorsement article: [A second Trump term comes with unacceptable risks](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/10/31/a-second-trump-term-comes-with-unacceptable-risks)

> By making Mr Trump leader of the free world, Americans would be gambling with the economy, the rule of law and international peace. We cannot quantify the chance that something will go badly wrong: nobody can. But we believe voters who minimise it are deluding themselves.

> The case against Mr Trump begins with his policies. In 2016 the Republican platform was still caught between the Mitt Romney party and the Trump party. Today’s version is more extreme. Mr Trump favours a 20% tariff on all imports and has talked of charging over 200% or even 500% on cars from Mexico. He proposes to deport millions of irregular immigrants, many with jobs and American children. He would extend tax cuts even though the budget deficit is at a level usually seen only during war or recession, suggesting a blithe indifference to sound fiscal management.

> The risks for domestic and foreign policy are amplified by the last big difference between Mr Trump’s first term and a possible second one: he would be less constrained. The president who mused about firing missiles at drug labs in Mexico was held back by the people and institutions around him. Since then the Republican Party has organised itself around fealty to Mr Trump. Friendly think-tanks have vetted lists of loyal people to serve in the next administration. The Supreme Court has weakened the checks on presidents by ruling that they cannot be prosecuted for official acts.

> If external constraints are looser, much more will depend on Mr Trump’s character. Given his unrepentant contempt for the constitution after losing the election in 2020, it is hard to be optimistic. Half his former cabinet members have refused to endorse him. The most senior Republican senator describes him as a “despicable human being”. Both his former chief-of-staff and former head of the joint chiefs call him a fascist. If you were interviewing a job applicant, you would not brush off such character references.

The biggest expectation of a second Trump presidency is that the full force of the federal government (including the DOD) will be turned against Trump's perceived enemies.

>The article is a little too *both sides are bad!* for my liking

Financial and economic takes on politics don't generally judge politicians by social issues - they judge them on how it will impact the markets, the economy, small and large businesses, banking, returns, etc. 

It's why many people try to clarify that they are ""fiscal conservatives"" - to distance themselves from the social implications. It's as if they are saying ""I'll happily fly a pride flag outside my shop and employ women at equal pay, but at the end of the day it's my shop that I'm voting for""

This stance doesn't really hold up with so much on the line this time around though. When everything is more or less status quo, you can get away with ""I'll vote for my own interests"" but this time is so obviously different.",2024_10_31

"Voting for a Trump can be a perfectly rational decision depending on context. If you’re a Christian whose priority is to end abortion, you vote for him.

Too many people on Reddit just want to ascribe racism or stupidity or hate to all Trump voters without taking to time to actually understand the nuances of why people support him. Certainly there are segments of his followers where that is the answer, but even that can be rational. The only way to beat this Maga movement is to steel man their perceptive so that we understand it and can undermine it effectively. Anything else is a band aid.",2024_10_31

"The only shocking thing is that it's taken this long for the economist to endorse. It's not like we haven't known for months that Trumps economic plans were tantamount to economic suicide.

"These two dimwits deserve each other. Just a few months ago, Trump used to call him ""the dumbest member of the Kennedy Clan"" and said that he was a ""total fake"":

>""He’s one of my favorite candidates, Cornel West. And I like — I like her also, Jill Stein. I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100% \[votes\] from them. He takes 100%. Kennedy is probably 50/50, but he’s a fake. He's a fake. He's a total fake.”

>– Donald Trump, June 2024

RFK Jr. went even further, calling Trump a ""sociopath"" incapable of governing and doing a massive rant on Twitter highlighting Trump's numerous shortcomings. 

[RFK Jr. said Trump ‘barely human’ and ‘probably a sociopath’ in recent texts](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4811282-robert-kennedy-jr-trump/)

>“I think Donald Trump was a terrible president. \[...\] I don’t think he’s capable of governing of meeting the expectations and fulfilling the promises that he raises with his rhetoric.”

>– RKF Jr, July 2024",2024_10_31
"At the risk of beating a dead Central Park bear:


RFK Jr will destroy public health worse than Donald Trump's pandemic response. Where Trump as haphazard, aloof and stupid, Bobby will be deliberate, demanding and dangerous. If allowed, RFK Jr will dismantle the institutions we take for granted. The ones that keep our kids alive and the ones than keep rampant disease from destroying our economy. 

He believes (or says he believes) in Chronic Childhood Disease. And that this ill-defined class of illnesses have a single toxin responsible. A single toxin. He has no proof and presented no evidence to support this claim. He's looking for a needle in a haystack. He'll send America on an expansive and fruitless wild goose chase. Spending precious dollars that will be pulled from more worth while programs looking for this. All the while driving out hardworking public servants through constant vilification. 

He started the 'World Mercury Project' *after* most drug companies stopped using Thimerosal in their injections. He went to Samoa to dance on the graves of children claiming, with no proof, they were victims of vaccines. He ran around the world during the pandemic claiming lockdowns were akin to Nazi Germany. He own family has distanced themselves from his campaign and his deadly anti-vaxx stance. 

More children will die if Donald Trump gives Robert F Kennedy Jr an ounce of power.",2024_10_31

Trump gets him to do that by making some promises Trump knows he will not keep, but will give them out to get RFK, Jr to go along. FWIW, this is Trump’s MO with every segment of the electorate. Just pick one, and you will see. Now that Trump got RFK, Jr to step down, he no longer needs him.

"Most people don't understand just how deep RFK Jr. has been in conspiracy/antivax circles since at least 2005. There was a study done a while back - can't find it on short notice - that linked basically all antivax propaganda spread online to something like just 6 or 7 seminal sources who were actually writing it - everyone else was basically just parroting and forwarding it.

RFK Jr. was #1 on that list. He has, for decades now, been a superstar of the antivax circuit (yes, it really exists, and pays people like RFK Jr. millions of dollars in speaking fees) whose propaganda has cost untold loss of human life and human suffering in general. His rhetoric can be directly linked to a measles outbreak that killed 83 people. He has claimed that the suffering Anne Frank encountered was nothing compared to what antivaxxers go through. Etc.

He's not just an idiot, he's one of the monsters of history. Medical science has given us the closest thing to a silver bullet we've ever had to defeating *one of the four goddamn horsemen of the apocalypse* and he is the superstar of a movement that has dedicated its existence to fighting it.",2024_10_31

Meanwhille, the price dropped because faceless Reddit and Twitter influencers and millionaires are manipulating them to pump it up and get rich. Then they bought more. Then the rich people influencing them sold when the price went up. They've been doing it for years now.

And to cope and keep them interested, they've convinced them that holding their worthless stock is a virtuous stand against the very people using their stupidity for easy gains.

And I just could help but laugh given my discussion just the day before.


Second: my late grandfather in law.  Again very fox newsy - lock her up bumper sticker etc.   but the amusing thing was how his views changed depending on whether he was primed by Fox News on a particular topic or not.   If he was primed: “of course the billionaires deserve to keep all their money” if we wasn’t: “omg the rich people are destroying my old neighborhood.”  So basically depending on whether he saw it on Fox News or saw it in real life his views would swing from extreme right to extreme left.",2024_10_31

I say, “Google owns YouTube.” I explain it was an algorithm issue, they say it’s not an algorithm issue.

I’m just… “what? That’s literally what you’re angry about!”

Part of me thinks that most of the polls are already rife with inaccuracy and the people at the top of the companies running these want a trump win. So they subtly influence the polls to look like trump is going to win to dampen democrat turnout and encourage maga.

The other part of me thinks they dont want maga to see harris winning at the polls and resort to violence to try to “”fix things””. Harris and Trump “are effectively tied” in a lot of polls nationwide and maga is already setting fire to ballot boxes and swinging machetes at voters. Imagine how further deranged if they knew they were losing hard.

Instead these polls got them right where dems were in 2016; complacent in things as they unwittingly march to defeat, in what they thought would be a slam dunk of a win

However, I’ve had my fair share of disagreements with other people on nuances and left-leaning contains a very wide tent of ideas. Which is what politics used to be - there were heated exchanges on what the tax rate ought to be and how progressive it should be, but there was an underlying agreement that taxes are good and a progressive tax system is the best option. Now, there isn’t even that. right wing extremism things we should eliminate taxes all together. That is just one example of how this isn’t a “both sides hive mind” world. 


The MAGA subs demand absolute loyalty. If you question something or even suggest that a MAGA talking point is false, you’re shadow banned. Now that’s what I would call a hive mind. Yes, you’ll be down voted into oblivion on this sub if you are going to spew alt-right talking points, but if we’re really going to chalk up needing a basic grasp and understanding of reality as a “hive mind”, then I don’t know what to tell you.

Biggus doubtus. These militias have never amassed in coherent large groups, theres a reason. Now, they're not all heavy seals, but lots are. Some cells have decent command, most don't (watch videos they themselves release, among others).

They're ideologically aligned in a broad way, but not organizationally. They seem to lack the ability to move large groups in unison.

If it is a blue wave, I don't see the Court giving Trump the presidency, but they might make it harder for people to exercise the right to vote in the future.

This means the House of Reps will likely vote for Trump and Mike Johnson will certify it. If for some reason republicans dont all vote for Trump the the riots will commence and they will try and breach the capital to kill Congress again. 

I can tell you this 2 of the three commissioners in my county are already gearing up to deny our election results in our county in Pa (we are a red county). They are doing this so that even if Trump wins our county, Pa will still look like it has voter fraud. Trump is also saying Berks county has election fraud. Hes and the Republican Party (MAGA party) are already laying the ground work to get this election sent to congress. 

This plan works two fold because if he loses it was fraud. If he wins he beat the corruption and he can now put them behind bars.

But if they do I hope they keep the cameras rolling as the assholes receive wave after wave of teargas and rubber bullets. 

If any of these fringe groups are communicating on sites or apps then some govt agency, probably the FBI, will be keeping tabs on what the plan is to some extent before it happens. It would be easier for them to have smaller groups attack multiple places nationwide. I don’t think it will be about being in DC to overthrow the election anymore, I think they are just going to be livid. But maybe if there are certain dates between Election Day and the inauguration when the states individually certify before it goes to DC then those would be the days to look out for imo.",2024_10_31

"We're joking about this, but two things hold here:


1. People who follow the Economist who knows what this means
2. People who just hear the word ""economist"" and assume what it means


In both cases, it ties Harris to ""economic endorsement"" and that's what's needed right now.


Big W.",2024_10_31
"> If The Economist had a vote, we would cast it for Kamala Harris

***VOTE BLUE*** and take someone with you to do the same. And volunteer at https://go.kamalaharris.com today! Even just 15 minutes can make a world of difference!",2024_10_31
The Economist has more courage than everyone still working at the Washington Post and the LA Times.,2024_10_31
"Here are some highlights from the Economist's endorsement article:

> By making Mr Trump leader of the free world, Americans would be gambling with the economy, the rule of law and international peace. We cannot quantify the chance that something will go badly wrong: nobody can. But we believe voters who minimise it are deluding themselves.

> The case against Mr Trump begins with his policies. In 2016 the Republican platform was still caught between the Mitt Romney party and the Trump party. Today’s version is more extreme. Mr Trump favours a 20% tariff on all imports and has talked of charging over 200% or even 500% on cars from Mexico. He proposes to deport millions of irregular immigrants, many with jobs and American children. He would extend tax cuts even though the budget deficit is at a level usually seen only during war or recession, suggesting a blithe indifference to sound fiscal management.

> The risks for domestic and foreign policy are amplified by the last big difference between Mr Trump’s first term and a possible second one: he would be less constrained. The president who mused about firing missiles at drug labs in Mexico was held back by the people and institutions around him. Since then the Republican Party has organised itself around fealty to Mr Trump. Friendly think-tanks have vetted lists of loyal people to serve in the next administration. The Supreme Court has weakened the checks on presidents by ruling that they cannot be prosecuted for official acts.

> If external constraints are looser, much more will depend on Mr Trump’s character. Given his unrepentant contempt for the constitution after losing the election in 2020, it is hard to be optimistic. Half his former cabinet members have refused to endorse him. The most senior Republican senator describes him as a “despicable human being”. Both his former chief-of-staff and former head of the joint chiefs call him a fascist. If you were interviewing a job applicant, you would not brush off such character references.

The article is a little too *both sides are bad!* for my liking, but hey, if it convinces anyone to not vote for Trump, you won't see me complaining.",2024_10_31

"If he wins this time, our great ‘liberal media’ would have had a large part to play in it. Not taking steps to fact check and clarify the misinformation/disinformation is extremely hurtful to the democratic process. Yeah we did it a few times is just not enough. It has to be done consistently. For example, about the economy, inflation has been historically low in the US throughout this last decade, with extreme money printing and low interest rates, simply because the supply side is always controlled. There is always abundant supply of stuff here and thus inflation was low, even though there is always excess money in the system. This is what happened during Trump’s time too. He DID NOT do anything in particular to effect low inflation. Then along came Covid and inflation spiraled due to global supply chain disruptions. The Fed’s denial through second half of 2020 and most of 2021 exacerbated it to a certain extent. And now inflation is close to target albeit with raised prices, which is absolutely hurting household budgets. But Trump DOES NOT have a plan to counter this besides harping on that ONLY lowering energy costs will bring prices down. It is laughable. And I have not heard the ‘so called liberal media’ point this out EVEN ONCE all the while claiming Harris does not give specifics of her plan. It is fucking sad. I fully understand that even if the media gives an objective take on this, it is not going to appeal to most MAGA but at least, to those on the fence, it might and the media has unfortunately forsaken this important role of theirs.",2024_10_31

He’s going to go up 0.1% in Pennsylvania with 1% of the vote in and call the state for himself,2024_10_31
"Ah, but will you be ready if he does it on *MONDAY?*

Surprise libs!",2024_10_31
Trump has claimed victory every Tuesday for the past four years. What’s new?,2024_10_31
It's not him declaring victory that worries me.  It's his goons stealing the election for him.  I don't expect her to reveal her strategy to counteract their shenanigans that will deny her electors and give Trump the majority.,2024_10_31
"You can’t have a peaceful transfer of power if only one side is willing to peacefully transfer power.

That is the threat to democracy, not the possibility of lawsuits or sending a mob to attack the capital building.

The underlying threat is that Donald Trump does not believe in democracy but we are all pretending he does.",2024_10_31
So the warning shot has been fired... they are ready for him,2024_10_31
"It seems like if she wins Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, she will have won the swing states that are unlikely to refuse to certify and she will win. Is this incorrect?",2024_10_31
"He's going to cry fraud when he starts losing the battleground states. He's going to incite terrorism from his phone. His militia-wing of the base will become activated and people will die. 

There's no doubt in my mind this is going to happen. He has literally everything to lose if he loses this election and his moral depravity has no bounds.",2024_10_31
"He’s as predictable as Christmas, OF COURSE he’ll do this. Glad to hear that it won’t catch her campaign flat footed.",2024_10_31
"The lies have already started, so Harris needs to be prepared to address the nation. If RW radicals engage in violence, we'll just let law enforcement, National Guard, the military, etc. do their job.",2024_10_31

I expect Trump to declare victory around 8am Tuesday morning,2024_10_31
"Hot take:  Trump’s team is so insecure that they have been telegraphing their intent for years in the struggle to stay in the spotlight-  I.e. feeding their base the red meat they so crave…

Kamala knows everything we do, and likely much, much more as VP.

Simply put:  Trump has to get beat in his own game, while playing by his rules.  

Only then will his base even have a chance to start recovering from the brainwashing they’ve ingested for however many years…. And then only maybe.

Kamala has done it since day one:  her policy positions make her the adult in the room, and this country needs that adult more than we collectively understand.  

I am heartened to have it confirmed that “they have the bullshit handled” when it comes to the barrage of falsehoods implying that our elections aren’t fair-

Can’t wait to see it",2024_10_31
[Here is Robert Reich explaining how Trump weaponized the red mirage. Tricking Republicans into thinking it's abnormal](https://youtu.be/5XEQ_7zZ-bw?si=UdEGl_3HBgOVYrT7),2024_10_31
It needs to be a blowout. He can't declare victory if he's  trailing through the night,2024_10_31
"I just want to say this should be a joyful time. We're on the cusp of our first madam president, Kamala could go down in history books forever in this country if she wins on Tuesday, she'll be talked about a hundred years from now. That is quite special to think about. 

And it's being marred by the fact that her opponent is the biggest jackass on the planet that spawned a cult of bad faith violent assholes and a corrupt judicial system. It's as uphill and ugly as it gets.

Despite all that, victory is still very much attainable for her.",2024_10_31
There is a 100% chance he will declare victory in prime time on election night. There is a lot of reporting that he is mad that he waited in 2020.,2024_10_31

What he declares is irrelevant.  People need to stop acting like he has powers he doesn't.  That only gives credence to his shenanigans.,2024_10_31
It's time America removes this ugly orange stain on their history once and for all.,2024_10_31
"Democrats get a lot of flak about not standing up to republicans in congress (sometimes rightfully so) - and that’s what makes me anxious about another insurrection attempt. I hope Dems don’t play nice to avoid a major conflict & don’t end up taking whatever Republicans try doing.

We all need to be mentally and emotionally ready for this as well and not fall to pieces but hold ourselves and each other up. Sending lots of love.,2024_10_31
Hell he'll do it by Friday,2024_10_31
"If?  I mean, he’s already suing for “cheating.”  He has a plan for his personal success and that includes declaring victory during the red mirage.  But guess what: anybody can declare anything at any time.  That don’t make it so.",2024_10_31
"If there were ever a time the Democrats have to go low, and for the jugular, it’s this election. Kamala and her legal team need to fuck their shit up hard the moment they start. It’s literally a fight or flight moment. ",2024_10_31

"What in the absolute fuck, though. Every insane thing the modern day GOP does is so much more insane than the last thing, that we have normalized all of this. 

The mere fact that one party has to have hundreds of lawyers at the ready for the other party to attempt to steal the election - in the United States - is baffling to me. And yes, I understand this also happened at Bush V Gore, but it’s jumped the shark now.",2024_10_31
"Remember: Republican-majority districts tend to be smaller, so they report results faster.  The larger, Democratic-heavy districts take longer to report their results.

This happens in every General Election - it's expected.

Trump lies and claims that Republican leads are erased by fraud or whatever, because all he ever does is lie.",2024_10_31
"Yep, election isn’t over until EVERY vote is counted. No stop the count bullshit.",2024_10_31

"When it comes to the election result, the danger are the state officials and the courts that could hand Trump the victory.",2024_10_31
Well he's going to. But this time he's not the president and nobody in the swing states is going to go to jail for him so he can cry all he wants. It's literally the oval office or a jail cell for him.,2024_10_31

"Two things I'm certain of in an otherwise completely baffling election. Trump will declare victory almost immediately, and all sorts of fake results will be spread all over social media, particularly Twitter.",2024_10_31
He's going to immediately claim victory and then say the election was stolen when he loses.,2024_10_31
I'm sure she meant *when* he prematurely claims victory.,2024_10_31
"Yeah no fucking shit he's going to claim victory Tuesday. Even if he's losing (let's hope) by an undeniable margin, he'll still day he's winning and everyone's just cheating. Regardless of what happens he'll say he's winning and he's going to cry and stamp his feet and start every legal challenge he can to stop votes from being counted. And you can bet your ass he has loyalists in place in as many districts as possible to help him with whatever greasy plan he's concocted. This shits gonna get real ugly and I just hope so many people go vote and there are enough decent people left to stand up to the wrongdoing and our country gets through this",2024_10_31

I don’t want to know what’s going on, and I don’t want to see what’s going on. I can only control what I can control. God forbid Trump wins. If that’s the outcome, my wife will be calling her business contact in Europe, and we will be taking work visas overseas long term. I can’t take another Trump presidency. The amount of racism and aggression I experienced during his presidency was demoralizing. Back then, I was in the service, and I was begging my UDM (unit deployment manager) to give me a long-term deployment anywhere. I didn’t give a shit where it was.",2024_10_31
"What do you mean ""if""?",2024_10_31
The fact that we can absolutely count on him to throw a temper tantrum and claim fraud should be SO concerning to anyone who values healthy adult behavior in a president. Why do so many people not?,2024_10_31
Trump is going to declare victory before the polls close. This isn't a big surprise. He's a criminal and a con man and his people are going to flood the zone with as much shit as possible.,2024_10_31

"Of course she will. She’s not stupid, and neither is Biden. They’ve been screaming their evil plan to the hills",2024_10_31
He will probably claim he won right after he gets his first state.,2024_10_31
Maybe this time they won't give up immediately like the Gore campaign did in 2000.,2024_10_31
I feel like news outlets like to call it well before voting is done. I feel bad for people living in Hawaii.  It is one thing if your state isn't a swing state.  It is another if they are calling the election before you even get off work.,2024_10_31
"What does she mean ""if?"" He's already been calling this election for himself for months, just like he did the previous ones.",2024_10_31
Harris should claim victory the moment the polls open on Tuesday,2024_10_31
"Harris will be in Pence’s position on Jan 6. Now that the Supreme Court has clarified that a US President has full immunity, I’d understand if Harris Biden resort to using Trump’s court against him.",2024_10_31
"What a waste of resources, having to deal with republican fuckery",2024_10_31
I'm surprised he hasn't claimed victory already to be honest.,2024_10_31
Don’t do what Al Gore did. We can’t afford it. MAGATs will NOT be gracious.,2024_10_31
He's already filing lawsuits claiming it was stolen.,2024_10_31
"Even if the electoral map came up like the opposite of 1984, with 49 blue states and one red (or orange?) state, that lying fascist fuck would still claim he ""won"", and won bigly!",2024_10_31
"I’m worried the media will help him like they’ve helped him all year. If he falsely claims victory they’ll just parrot it, framing it as a he said she said. They’re also going to do their “race to 270” on Tuesday even though it’s not a fucking race. It’s a count. It’s not over when someone crosses the finish line. It’s over when all the votes are counted, unless it’s a landslide. But the fake urgency gets views.",2024_10_31
"They're definitely going to claim victory before 9pm and start the lawsuits, it's all been planned. It's highly unlikely but the best destruction to this plan would be if a very unexpected state flips, they wouldn't be ready for that, their planned lawsuit flood would be thrown out of whack.",2024_10_31
No matter. According to SCOTUS  Biden can just jail trump indefinitely,2024_10_31
"They're already setting fire to ballot boxes and it's not even the weekend yet. We are in for a long week next week, get ready.",2024_10_31
"Why do they even bother using the word ""if""",2024_10_31
"The thing I think the US needs to get on top of is how we are at the point where this man is able to run again. He said the election would only count if he won last time for months leading in. Then he asked people to find votes. Then he incited an insurrection. He was not held accountable for any of this. And he is doing it all again. 

And if he wins he will turn democracy off. We all know it. He’s basically doing it now, as much as he can get away with. He’s only operating within the system as much as he absolutely has to.

The US needs an urgent review of the timescales involved, and the penalties for, in being prosecuted for this type of activity. The only saving grace is that Trump is so damn stupid, and his sycophants are so damn stupid, that they haven’t been able to pull it off. Now you are giving them another chance? As they say, hurt me once, your mistake. Hurt me twice, my mistake.",2024_10_31
"There is no ""if"", he definitely will do it. He's going to try a constitutional crisis. Ask any of the diehard MAGA types, they don't think it's possible that Kamala can win. Either trump wins and the election is legitimate, or Kamala wins and it was rigged and stolen. This is insanely dangerous. Trump has had 4 years to come up with a plan to steal an election, and he has been working to get rid of all the little known patriots who prevented him from stealing the election in 2020. There are less people to stand in the way, and many of them would be sympathetic now to Trumps crazy claims.",2024_10_31
"IF he prematurely claims victory? There's no if. There is a 100% chance he is going to declare he won early so that he can claim to his base that the election was stolen from him again as soon as Kamela catches up to him and surpasses him in votes. And you know they'll all just take him at his word, stir themselves up into a violent frenzy, then the sequel to January 6th will occur. What I'm more worries about Tuesday though is the potential for violence and domestic terrorism on election day. I am absolutely certain there are supporters of his out there who would shoot up voting areas in left leaning areas under the guise of Patriotism and defending the United States from those evil liberals trying to steal the election from Trump. Absolutely terrified of something like that happening Tuesday, and the MAGA terrorist traitors probably won't even think twice about killing liberals since they assume Trump will just pardon them. Fuck everything about Trump, his disgusting supporters, and the living hell we are dealing with because of them.",2024_10_31
Surely Dem Governors of KY or KS (or NC if the NC is a trump win) could refuse to certify until GA or NV  does since it removes the numerator and denominator (eg 270/538 without KY means Harris needs 267/533),2024_10_31

Even if Trump loses and we get past inauguration major issue, they will keep significantly undermining our country until they are in power. Their motivations fall into three categories greed, power and trying to self fulfill some clearly evil prophecy.

"Hell I’m not pretending. The fucked up thing is the folks around him and many republicans in congress aren’t either, because it should be a step too far for anyone who has taken an oath to serve the country. But Trump is the voice of the GOP, he gets the headlines. So he has succeeded in taking control of the narrative. And angry people (his constituents) are very quick to accept their enemy (anyone not a republican) is cheating because of course they would, they’re evil. 

As long as humans have had civilizations we’ve felt threatened by people who arent in our tribe. This is the “default” behavior, and we’ve spent generations teaching people to accept being united at a higher level… at a state and national and international level. To accept those outside our group, that we should all have equal rights and opportunity. Freedom of speech is very valuable and important and I agree with that right — but without an adequately prepared population apparently one person can completely upend generations of progress, mostly through rhetoric.",2024_10_31

The thing is that most swing states have updated their election counting laws to allow mail in ballots to be opened a processed DURING Election Day.  There's not going to be the super late night drops like in 2020.

I have witnessed this for 7 presidential elections. Every time vote tallies are reported (and they were ahead), they think it's over and any more vote tallies reported is cheating after the game is already over. As if when votes are reported is the final score in that state.

They watch it like a football score. When they were going on in 2020 about how they won on Election night ""and then suddenly overnight"" Biden had more votes they really thought someone looked at the ""scoreboard"" and made up points for Biden. They wanted the vote counting to ""stop"" because they absolutely believed the reports that had them ahead is the final count, and only when they are ahead.

It's not a sports score. Different counties have different makeups for votes between Democrat, Republican, or Independent. Some are more ""blue"" than others are ""red."" It is lost on them. Completely lost.

You can't really find an average Republican that doesn't think votes were made up for Gore in Florida for 2000. They are convinced dead people voted for Clinton's 2nd term.

> Trump and House Speaker Johnson may attempt to have Republican-controlled states delay certifying their election results past the December 11, 2024 deadline. This could reduce the total number of Electoral College electors below 538. Under their interpretation of the 12th Amendment, Trump would then only need a majority of the remaining appointed electors to win, rather than 270 votes. Speaker Johnson could enforce this December 11 deadline since he'll still be in power until January 3, 2025.

The House only matters in a contested election, in which the states vote individually. The Speaker only presides over this, it's ultimately easy math. In theory a speaker could try to whip votes to a particular party, but that would never happen with Johnson, the GOP, or really even the DNC/Jeffries.

If there's a contested election that reaches the House, Trump wins. He only needs 26 states and he has 30 at least. Maybe more/fewer if either party really sweeps the House, but it is Trump's math almost no matter what.

Don't let this be a contested election. Vote, make sure your vote is counted, volunteer, guard, and watch. And donate your money and your time.

Harris and all down ballot elections are holding mass vote bank drives this weekend. It's EASY! Train over Zoom for 30 minutes, get a list of people to call, most vote banks also give you caller ID protection (dial/text thru numbers) to make sure your real number isn't out there.",2024_10_31

If Democrats win the House, Johnson won't be speaker even for a second on January 3rd. The House doesn't exist anymore once it adjourns, the first thing the new one does when they assemble is choose a new speaker. So Jeffries would be elected and sworn in and then swear in the rest.",2024_10_31

Shapiro is going to tell him to go self fornicate and sign the certification as he is required to do by very clearly spelled out laws. At best Republicans will piss and moan about some mail ballots arriving late or not being filled out correctly, which they are already challenging with mixed results.

">Existential crisis every 4 years 

More like every two years and every school board election, and also yes.

Religious fanatics and fascists don’t just give up. The GOP is no longer run by the old guard who seduced the religious right to their cause and dog whistled to racists. Nor is it even run by the religious right and the racists.

It’s run by their children and grandchildren, people for whom it was never a grift but a sincere belief. They have people screaming at them internally that spending $60 million dollars on “Kamala is for they/them” ads is pointless and stupid but they won’t stop because the objective isn’t to appeal to voters, it’s to make voters hate trans people.

It’s why they’ll never stop pushing on abortion. If someone *genuinely believes* that God demands they save every six week old fetus and that it is God’s will when a thirteen year old is raped or a quirk of fragile human physiology sentences a pregnant person to death, then leaving it as a state’s rights issue is not enough. Those terrible crimes must be stopped and the perpetrators punished. Even Trump admits that and he’s probably paid for abortions before.

(Nevermind that if their god ordains that a child be raped and go through the horror of a pregnancy at 12, then their god is evil)",2024_10_31
"
Democrats do not understand the threat. They know Republicans are dangerous but at the same time each Democrat wants to win reelection because they are politicians. If they don't then most of them are rich enough to not have to worry about the things you do. They do not think the voters will back them up if they try and shut down Republicans. For example, Trump never got in trouble. Trump never went to jail.

We are looking at 12 straight years of a Democrat in the White House. This is important but sometimes I feel like Republicans see this as more important than Democrats do. Biden, he was old school. He thought Republicans might maybe want to help make America become a better place. Took him like a year to figure that one out. Kamala, I think, is willing to square up with Republicans because she's looking at 8 years in The White House and she's not 80 years old.

The only way we make it out of this is Kamala becomes a leader AND, big AND here, all the Not-Republicans back her up when the time comes. 

Democrats do not understand the threat. Trump should have been in jail but Democrats were all ""Well, that would look bad and what would the other countries think? What would the moderate Republicans voters think about my reelection?"" It should have never gotten this far but time, and time, and time again, Republicans back Democrats into a corner and their response is ""When they go low, we just let them.""

>WHAT PLANS ARE THERE TO ADDRESS THIS VERY OBVIOUS ISSUE EVERYONE WITH HALF A BRAIN CELL SEES IS HAPPENING?!

Fuck if I know. I don't think I'm alone on this but if Kamala does not come out of the gate swinging I think a lot of people are done. Just fucking done. Kamala needs big moves early on if she doesn't want a tsunami of apathy to roll back in. Democrats letting Republicans sabotage everyone's daily lives constantly isn't going to work anymore. A lot is happening in the next 20 years.

The Jan 6 Marines not getting the book thrown at them and basically being put back into an even *more* secure role in the military tells me that the Marines, at least, might be down for another insurrection. Even worse, I am still chewing over the stats that 20% of the people arrested on Jan 6 had military or law enforcement backgrounds.

If it were 10% I would still be worried, but 20% is a lot bigger threat, especially if there is top brass that would be willing to lead them, which sadly I think there might be one or two in the military if one were to look at the statistics from Jan 6 as a direct reflection of the entire military and their leaders.

That's what keeps me up at night, in the end. Trump and his merry band of fascists are acting like they've already won and the billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk that are jumping ship over to his side at this part in the race is definitely cause for concern. When the billionaires start to jump ship to fascism it's usually because they're seeing something others aren't seeing and it tends to be the very start of a successful fascist coup :\

No agency is going to broadly support a political group that calls for cuts in funding, deserved or not. That’s part of why a lot of teachers lean to the left. Understandably, LEOs don’t like the party that calls for them to not be able to purchase new APCs, grenade launchers and other wild stuff. Especially agencies that are in places that don’t need cops in tanks, like mine.


Unfortunately, the agencies STILL buy shiny new toys. They instead skimp on training and salary for their workers. Those who wise up quit. Those who don’t replace them. This leads to a reduction in the requirement qualifications for new hires, which leads to underqualified and undereducated LEOs who are more likely to use their position to offend.


Then there’s the social stigma. How many times have you heard “fuck cops?” How many times in a month do you say “fuck cops?” We’ve cultivated a divide between the average American and those who are supposed to be protecting us.

Musk has modified this scheme multiple times, so crime depends on what he was doing on a given day.  Some days it seemed to be an election bribe scheme, some days a fraudulent payment for one day of “work” as a Trump spokesperson, some days an illegal lottery. 

It’s a crime for the “winner” to take an election bribe, but it’s not necessarily a crime to be the recipient of the illegal lottery funds.  As for being the “spokesperson” who receives the fraudulently oversized payment for one day of work, it would probably depend on whether the person is deemed to have been knowingly engaged in misrepresenting the value of the work.  

As for the IRS, whether the payment they receive is legal or illegal, they still have to pay tax.

Yeah, but in those cases, the ""no purchase necessary"" case are people taking advantage of a loophole. The companies offering the the sweepstakes are *hoping* people enter by buying the bottle of soda and checking the cap. The people mailing in for an entry are just something they put up because enough people are buying the soda to make it worthwhile. 

Here, getting people's addresses and phone numbers he can spam with electioneering communications is the whole point. That's why Musk is doing this. Collecting people's contact info isn't just some beauricratic necessity to administer a sweepstakes to get people to buy soda, it's the only thing he wants.

But, yeah, it's definitely not the strongest case, despite Reddit calls to deport him over this.

The companies offering the the sweepstakes are hoping people enter by buying the bottle of soda and checking the cap. The people mailing in for an entry are just something they put up because enough people are buying the soda to make it worthwhile. 

The ""no purchase necessary"" thing is about *the company running it* using a loophole, not the people entering the contest. The super simplified legal logic is that as long as there's a way to enter for free, it's not a lottery. (I don't think we're disagreeing here, just wanted to make sure that info was clear)

But there's nothing (besides morals, privacy policies, etc) specifically stopping those other companies from using the entries as marketing data, and it seems naive to think they aren't likely doing so anyways. In that aspect, he doesn't seem to be doing anything tangibly different legally. Arguing otherwise seems like an impossibly high bar to reach, and even then would be entirely based on speculation about motive unless there's a smoking gun somewhere. 

>Do you have a link to the lawsuit? I couldn't find it yesterday. I'm going off this quote from it I saw in a CNBC that seems to be their rationale in classifying it as a lottery (where you have to offer something of value to enter) and a sweepstakes (where you don't).

I was going off of the text of the OP's article, where it quotes the argument at the bottom. 

But this would reclassify virtually ***ALL*** sweepstakes as lotteries, and that seems like a reach for what this case is about. I can't think of a situation where customer data ***isn't*** valuable to a company to some degree, so you can't just set the bar there. And would open the door to a massive amount of tangentially related cases arguing about whether or not contact information counts as payment in any number of different situations. 

>But obviously, even if the court decide it is a sweepstakes, they can still get in trouble for running an illegal sweepstakes.

Agreed, he's clearly doing ***something*** wrong here, I just don't believe ""Having to identify yourself to enter counts as payment, so it's not free to enter"" holds any water.

The hope is if more Trumpers (who are about +10 to +12% more male) have voted early there had to be a corresponding spike in females to hold the ratio to its 2020 level.

Yeah, I'm not sure either about Trump's total for Men this year vs. 2020 vs. 2016. But the gender gap between him and Harris is wider than it was between Trump and Biden in 2020. Crazy times this year. Election night will be interesting!",2024_10_31

"I agree that the early voting data is not something we should read too much into. It is quite possibly, probably even likely, that it’s a factor of who is voting when, not how the demographic break down will turn out in the end.

That said, based on polling we know that there has been a significant shift in the polling results for white women since 2016. They’re obviously no where near what black women do, but even a few points can make a big difference.  Point being - I feel like there is a good likelihood that the female vote is running up higher numbers for Kamala than it did for Hillary.",2024_10_31

"Honestly the polls are too inaccurate for me to give a good example. The trend seems to be that Harris has widened the gap from 2020 by a couple of percentage points. (54-55 Harris v. 42-43 Trump this year, against 54 v. 43 in 2020.) 

But these polls all have multiple points of error for each candidate here, so I really do not think we can know. It seems reasonable to assume that there is at least a *slight* trend, but it might not exist, or it might be much larger than the polls show. 

At this point everything is noise. There are too many factors involved in this election to be able to reasonably compare to past ones.",2024_10_31

Just a snippet:

""United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain late Tuesday called for working class unity against Republican nominee Donald Trump in the final stretch of the 2024 race, warning that the former president would serve the interests of his own class and embolden the nation's executives to intensify their decades-long war on the labor movement.

Responding to members who question why the UAW is involved in the political process at all, Fain said during a video livestream that ""we are up against a billionaire class that will not stop their attack on us at the bargaining table.""

""They will not stop at the workplace, they will not stop at the border—they will take every inch we give them,"" said the president of the UAW, which has endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. ""We don't engage in political activity because we like a candidate. We don't do it for ourselves, as your union leadership. We don't do it for the Democratic or Republican parties. We engage in politics as a union because it is core to our fight for economic and social justice.""

Fain said that the United States is currently trapped in a ""vicious cycle"" in which the ""ruling class has waged a one-sided class war on the working class, and they've been winning.""

""We're in a vicious cycle where the billionaire and corporate class take more and more for themselves and rewrite the rules of the game to keep it that way,"" said Fain. ""They use their insane wealth to buy off politicians and elections. The lap dogs of the billionaires then pass more laws that restrict unions and keep working-class people down. They consolidate the fruits of our labor into the hands of Wall Street and corporate America, and that cycle goes on and on.""

""It is an embarrassment to our democracy when billionaires can openly buy elections. But it's also a devastating situation for the working class.""

Fain acknowledged that ""it's a bipartisan issue"" and that billionaires have ""done everything they can to buy off both parties,"" characterizing the GOP as the outspoken party of big business and condemning ""corporate Democrats"" who ""have also cozied up to the rich.""

**""It is an embarrassment to our democracy when billionaires can openly buy elections,"" said Fain. ""But it's also a devastating situation for the working class.""**

But in the 2024 election, Fain argued, the choice is stark.""",2024_10_31

If she somehow doesn't win the presidency, I'm going to be absolutely devastated. Not even because Trump is going to set out to systematically destroy America as we know it, but because we would be robbed of the opportunity to see her put America back on the right track and restore our place in the world order as a champion of liberty and freedom. 

America has long been the tip of the spear when it comes to fighting tyranny and dictatorships around the world. Our allies, and the world in general, need us to step back into that role with Harris at the helm. The vultures of Russian and China and the billionaire oligarch class have smelled blood in the water in America ever since Trump won the Republican primary almost a decade ago because they all knew that Trump could be bought and/or manipulated.

Harris cannot be. She has spent her entire life as a public servant and bleeds red white and blue. Trump and his kind are clearly terrified of her, and for good reason.....",2024_10_31

> Vice President Kamala Harris gave a speech on Tuesday night that largely exorcised the dark forces that have hung over the National Mall ever since January 6, 2021.

> In a video, the president referred to Sunday&#039;s rhetoric as &quot;Garbage,&quot; and the GOP and its flying monkeys insisted that the president had referred to the former president*&#039;s supporters as &quot;Garbage.&quot; Oooh! A &quot;Deplorables&quot; moment! The popinjay political press-Axios and, inevitably, Tiger Beat on the Potomac-gleefully glommed onto the meretricious barbering of what the president said.

> Sitting about 1,000 feet behind her in the White House, President JOE BIDEN was busy undoing all of that, handing Republicans fuel to undermine that argument precisely one week before the first votes get counted.

"A deeply reactionary speech, but par for the course for Democrats, I think.

> Nearly 250 years ago, America was born when we wrested freedom from a petty tyrant.

Identifying as ""we"" even though the vast majority of her crowd would have been disenfranchised when the country was founded. Unless you're a rich landlowning white guy, there is no ""we"" when it comes to the founding.

She continues this conflation of the ruling class and everyone else below: 

> Across the generations, Americans have preserved that freedom, expanded it, and in so doing proved to the world that **a government of, by, and for the people is strong and can endure**. And those who came before us...**on farmlands, and factory floors, they did not struggle, sacrifice and lay down their lives only to see us seed our fundamental freedoms. They didn’t do that only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant.**

Labor organizers and civil rights activists were spied on, shot, deported, and locked up by the U.S. government. And continue to be. That government has a lot of work to do before talking about ""us"". She wants to claim Stonewall while giving a state's rights argument about trans people? *Oof*

> We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths—that all of us are created equal —is the star that guides us still...to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that **our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.**

This universalism, from the same party that refused to let a single Palestinian on the main stage at the DNC while letting multiple fascists speak.

And they continue to do it today. They are soft-peddling the hate-speech uttered by Trump and his Nazi sycophants at Madison Square Garden, while excoriating Biden for mirroring what Trump himself called America and calling Trump's supporters 'Garbage'.

Trump isn’t lying when he said Iran was broke when he was in office, they were set back years from not being able to trade oil. Now Iranian funded military groups were able to massacre Israelis on behalf of Palestine. Trump wants to drill more on American soil and lift restrictions.

My energy bill for my home has gone up 50% in the last 2 years alone.

You and I both know Trump is a liar. The reporter does as well, but the word boast is a more accurate descriptor, as it not only does not imply intent like ""lie"" but it also describes the way in which he is speaking. 


It is as if people on this sub expect every news outlet to be expressly partisan in every single word they use.",2024_10_31

I swear if marketing and advertising get a hold of AI before other industries someone will tell it they want 100% market share and the AI will destroy the world but one person and place the product in that person's hand the product they were tasked with selling and claim success.",2024_10_31

Currently, 63% of registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents have already voted or plan to vote before Election Day, compared with 47% of Republicans and Republican leaners.

From Iowa; it’s been surprising & great to see Harris signs in the suburban farm land (within an hour of Des Moines). But rural farms? I’d been surprised if they walked themselves back from the edge. 2008 IA & 2024 IA are totally different states.,2024_10_31
"This was my logic, point by point!",2024_10_31
"I'm very concerned about losing this election.  The poll numbers are really eating away at me.

  
One thing that really surprised me is ... I'm in a DEEP RED county in upstate NY. This is my 3rd election cycle here. I have **never** seen any sort of signage for the Democratic party candidate before. Hillar, Biden. Nothing. 

Two months ago, they started popping up. This weekend we decided to early vote. On the way to the early voting, there were SO MANY Harris/Walz signs that we lost track. They were infront of farms. Infront of houses with mini excavators, equipment, trucks and trailers. That's not something I've ever seen 

But Trump is still polling ahead by a bit. It's nuts.",2024_10_31
"Thanks for the insight, sounds a lot like the rest of the country. Hope to make it to a Hawkeyes or Cyclones game one day",2024_10_31
"I should’ve made that a stronger point - to see ANY sort of Democratic sign on the more urban outlying farms is a crazy thing to see within itself!! & great!! But I wouldn’t go so far as to extrapolate that to farms where the town is 500 to 1,000 people in deep rural IA - the reason we have Grassley, Reynolds, etc.",2024_10_31

Sure, on paper he momentarily lost x amount of dollars when the price dropped 20% this morning, but I can almost guarantee the price action is planned. Elon probably funneled a ton of money in when it was $15 to get volume, then trump sells a fuck ton today to profit. Even zooming out to when it was nearly $100 two years ago doesn't mean he lost money. These people generate wealth by manipulation.
  
He's not just forever holding onto stocks and never selling. He's buying and selling as the price goes up and down, probably through dozens of different middlemen to make things look legit and avoid the laws that prevented him from selling before a certain date.",2024_10_31

Trump seems like the kind of guy who would be flying off the handles blaming anyone and everyone after losing $1.3B dollars in a day.

The American economy is *incredibly* strong right now, especially in the goods and services production, and inflation has been reined in and is in control. In fact, The US is one of the few countries that have come out *better* post-covid on a global scale, and I say this as a non-American, so it's not some sort of patriotic bias either.

"Exactly. Being elected president totally legitimized his lies and bs. Now he’s at a con level way beyond Hubbard. He’s leveraging religious thinking while still being about to distance himself from religion as needed. Across all Christian denominations (and other religions), it’s fundamental that you trust the people in your circle who are the authorities on what the truth is. No facts are of any importance in that world, just faith and trust in your leaders. Trump can be head of a destructive world-wide cult but be seen as a legitimate US president who “tells it like it is.” The situation disturbs me deeply. Truth is not just subjective but also easily fabricated for those indoctrinated into a religious mindset. I’m not saying all Christians support Trump or a feeble minded lemmings!

-Bit over half are white (not good)

I would imagine. Harris has the bigger appeal to younger voters (if they’re this crowd) but Trump’s approval never reaches 50%.

The historical Republican advantage and what made them competitive during the Reagan/Bush years was that they dominated the suburbs similar to how Dems dominate the cities.  Under Trump there has been a realignment that has made him and Republicans (a nationalist/populist) a little more competitive in the cities with certain demographics and more dominant in rural areas but the trade off has been a fairly steep decline in support in the suburbs particularly among women.   Essentially the Republican base has shifted from mostly college educated suburban whites who are more likely to vote to lower educated blue collar whites who are more in number but lower propensity voters.   Republicans will still win a good share of suburban voters but more and more cities have shifted to where the inner suburbs are turning blue/purple leaving only the outer suburbs as reliably red.,2024_10_31

Certainly not over but the more people vote the bigger that margin will be. Republicans are more consistent voters. That's why they hate making voting easier.

"All good, always good to remember the serendipity of how a modified line from *Gingerbread* was not only improved in Season 2 of *Angel* via *Epiphany*, but how marginalized athletes found meaning in it:

“If nothing we do matters…”

“On Wednesday, February 12, 2014, Comedy Central’s program “The Daily Show” aired a segment about Russian crackdowns on gay rights activists before and during the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Daily Show correspondent Jason Jones interviewed one of the few gay rights activists he could find in Sochi and asked her, “are you hopeful that Russia can change?”

Her response was: “I have to hope, because otherwise it’s too depressive....I really do it just to not be ashamed of me, of my way of living. I want to look at the eyes of my children and my grandchildren, and say, I did all I could.

As a quote from your—from an American TV show—it’s called ‘Angel’—there is a wonderful phrase there: ‘If nothing we do matters all that matters is what we do.’” This line comes from the episode “Epiphany,” during the scene when Angel is telling Kate about his recent realizations about how to help ease suffering in the world.” - *IMDB*",2024_10_31

Silent Majority. A lot of people tired of Trump do not shout out loud that they will vote for Harris. Same with democrats. Election is tiring. A lot of rational people made their decision very early to vote but will stay away from political commentary. Those people would probably not being polled.,2024_10_31
"So if you look at the math, there is an almost zero percent chance of all the polls being so tight.  In a theoretical actual 50-50 election, if you conducted 100 different polls from a sample population, you would expect to get about 10% of them that said it was tied, about 40% that said it was Kamala between +1 and +4 and about 40%  that said it was Trump between +1 and +4. The rest would be even bigger splits. If you want, you can do this yourself.  Take a coin, and flip it 100 times, recording the result.  While you would expect a 50-50 result, in practice a 50-50 result is actually really rare.

The fact that we are seeing all the polls so tightly bounded very strongly suggests the pollsters are adjusting their weighting to skew the results towards the middle because they don't want to be seen as outliers. 

With the coin flip example, say you got 47 heads and 53 tails.  You wouldn't want to say your flip sample is tails +6, because you know that people would look at you and call you a crackpot (especially if every other coin flipper reports 50-50).  So you then say your flipping methodology has a +2 tails bias and the real results are really tails+2, which is more in line with what everyone else is saying.",2024_10_31

Early voters are not reflective of the overall electorate. It's very possible for the early voters to go for Harris and election day voters to go for Trump. We still don't know how things will look in the end.,2024_10_31

I have no idea and don’t respond for that reason and because that I don’t know how that info will be used.  But there’s a demographic to whom that will not occur and I suspect that’s an older demographic more likely to vote trump.

I also don’t know how polling really works so, even though I don’t doubt the “legitimacy” of polls used by credible news sources, I wonder about the fine print that statisticians know about that affect how I should view a given poll. Like, ok they’re “statistically tied.”  Ok, what does that mean? Based on what polls conducted through what methods?  How many people and from where and what age? Etc.",2024_10_31

People actually work in trucks like that. Every single day. In and out, several times a day. In fact, there are far more unwieldy trucks out there in far more dangerous professions. But naturally Trump acts like he just conquered Mount Everest.  Keep in mind that Trump also called himself a builder once or twice during his career.

"> All these polls have a margin of error of about 5%. So essentially from Harris’ perspective, Pennsylvania could be -5 to +5

You're leaving out an important part as well: That margin of error only applies **if the survey were to be repeated with the same methodology.**

That's all that margin of error means. It doesn't necessarily indicate that the methodology is correct, merely that if you were to repeat with a different sample but the same methodology, you would get the same result +/- 5%.

I'm not calling you out in particular, but I do want to piggyback on your comment to mention that a common misconception about ""margin of error"" is that it somehow reflects the ""true"" results, +/- the MOE. That isn't what the MOE is measuring.

That's also why (in normal circumstances) a ""poll of polls"" is going to be more accurate, because it's blending multiple methodologies together. Some will be more accurate than others. There's a chance that _none_ of the methodologies are accurate, in which case there's very likely going to be a big polling miss.

But it's a bit disingenuous to say ""we know from this poll that Pennsylvania could be -5 to +5"" - the true number _could_ be anywhere, what it's actually saying is that if you were to repeat the poll you'd usually get a result in the range of +5 to -5. That's not the whole ballpark generally speaking, that's just the range of results you'd get if you conducted the study dozens of times.

There might be (will be) other threats to our experiment, but there is no combination of headspace currently presented (and hopefully never again in our lifetimes) that functions like he does, that could grift like he does. And it is specifically because he holds this Kramer-like kavorka duality where he is simultaneously fully aware that he is conning people, and (at that same moment) totally buying into his own shtick. 

He is an entertainer extraordinaire. And we love our circuses. I had forgotten how entertaining he was, having refused to watch him live so much of these eight years.

"Not just a felony sex crime, a felony sex crime against children. They're defining gender variance as inherently obscene and sexual, and our public existence as ""exposing"" any children who might be present to degenerate sexual activity.

And trying to [**seize trans children**](https://newrepublic.com/post/172444/florida-passes-bill-allowing-trans-kids-taken-families) from [**supportive cis parents**](https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/texas-attempt-to-tear-parents-and-trans-youth-apart-one-year-later) and criminally charge those parents, on the grounds that allowing their child's transition is on par with raping them.

And cis queer people are next on the block. In his concurring opinion after striking down Roe, Thomas wrote that the [**SCOTUS rulings prohibiting states from banning contraceptives, gay marriage, and ""sodomy"" may also be ""up for review""**](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/06/supreme-court-roe-v-wade-clarence-thomas-contraception-same-sex-marriage-sodomy) too.

Texas decision those laws will be enforceable again. And a whole lot of other states seem eager to re-instate laws like this too.

If ""sodomy"" laws are allowed to return, cis queer people's existence will be officially criminalized too. When queer relationships are by definition a sex crime, the public existence of cis queer people will be criminalized as pedophilic grooming just like trans people's public existence currently is.",2024_10_31

"The part that’s really aweful is they won’t just criminalize it, they will mark us as sex offenders, which limits where we can live and work",2024_10_31
"Yes. 

Or rather, they're claiming that being trans is an action. That one only becomes trans when one transitions, and that transition is itself a degenerate sexual act. That the public existence of people who have transitioned is people engaging in degenerate sexual acts in public, and as such is pedophilic abuse of any children who might witness it. 

And their entire mindset starts with the claim that the existence of minors who have transitioned is the product of pedophilic manipulation. That nobody is *really* trans, that this isn't part of who we are and how we were born, but rather that it's a ""contagion"" or ""ideology"" that children are intentionally infected with by predatory adults to turn them trans. That nobody actually needs to transition, and transition itself is inherently a degenerate sexual act, so when a minor transitions it is a minor engaging in degenerate sexual activity because some adult manipulated, groomed, or forced them into it. 

They are trying to seize trans children from supportive cis parents on the grounds that they ""groomed"" the child into transitioning, and that this is child sexual abuse on par with raping them. And they are trying to seize any other cis children in the family on the grounds that their parents are child sexual predators. The goal is to charge the parents with child sexual abuse, and remove the trans child from their custody so they can be forcibly de-transitioned.",2024_10_31

Also…Joe Biden isn’t the candidate.  He isn’t the candidate anymore specifically because he can’t control what he says anymore.  You’re not campaigning against Biden.

"Yeah. Am I really supposed to believe that there's any kind of actual outrage that a candidate's supporters are being called names. Literally days ago, at the Madison Square Garden rally, Trump said:

>We’re running against something far bigger than Joe or Kamala and far more powerful than them, which is a massive, vicious, crooked, radical left machine that runs today’s Democrat Party. They’re just vessels. In fact, they’re perfect vessels because they’ll never give them a hard time. They’ll do whatever they want. I know many of them. It’s just this amorphous group of people. But they’re smart and they’re vicious. And we have to defeat them.

>And when I say the enemy from within, the other side goes crazy, becomes a sound hole. How can he say now they’ve done very bad things to this country? **They are indeed the enemy from within.** But this is who we’re fighting. These are the people who are doing such harm to our country with their open border policies, record setting inflation, Green New Deal scam and everything else that they’re doing.

Yes, that's right. Trump, out of his own fucking mouth, called Democrats ""the enemy from within"". 

And earlier this month, during his interview with Maria Bartiromo, Trump said:

> I think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they're the - and it should be very easily handled by - if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military.

Put it together and it sure sounds like Trump is perfectly ok with using the military to ""handle"" Democrats.

So if Biden should be receiving ""outrage"" about his comment, shouldn't Trump be damn near forced to exit the race? As always, the double standard is fucking insane.",2024_10_31

"Based on the latest polling data, here’s a projection of the 2024 US election results in the Electoral College: AI is projecting a Trump Victory.

Given these trends, the estimated Electoral College results would be:

Kamala Harris 232 electoral votes
Donald Trump 306 electoral votes

My prediction suggests a victory for Kamala Harris using the Allan Lichtman Keys with some math to fit the keys.

All this went well beyond typical political division, it encouraged hostility, fear, and emboldened groups with deeply divisive and hateful agendas.  

There is no comparison between these actions and the general opposition from Democrats. The left’s criticisms are in response to Trump’s behavior, which actively undermines democratic norms and civility. Yes, Democrats have strongly opposed him, but I'd argue they haven't taken it far enough. Their reaction downplays his unprecedented disregard for basic standards of leadership and human decency.",2024_10_31

">Trump who half the country supports

Less than half in both elections and in polling but that's semantics

>somehow always trumps fault even though the left has gone after trump way harder than he’s gone after anyone else.

While the Democratic party has directly attacked Trump for quite a while, Trump has actively encouraged division by attacking US citizens calling anyone he disagrees with the ""Enemy within"" which is deeply troubling. On top of that, policy wise, Kamala has ventured further right than even Biden trying to win more centrist votes or votes of those who disagree with Trump's rhetoric but can't fully get behind a progressive agenda. The easiest example to pull for this is the border. If anyone is trying to reach a broader base of people to represent them, it's Kamala.


>both sides are equally guilty

This is just a clinically insane take. What recist dogma have the Democrats said? Did they call Puerto Rico a trash island? Did they encourage people to overturn a free and fair election? Have they threatened to use the military against US citizens who have different political ideologies? 

>where basically nothing changed

Another bad take.

">The border has been way worse under Biden

Can you define worse, and what policies lead to the worse result? From what I'm looking at, the main border control policy trump implemented was title 42 which Biden kept active for years. Also keep in mind trump used his political influence to block a border bill in order to use this as a running point rather than allowing Congress to work towards a solution. 

>crime has been worse under Biden,

Incorrect according to the FBI, do you have a source for your statistics? 

>Biden just called trump supporters garbage,

1. Biden isn't Kamala

2. This was in direct response to calling Puerto Rico a garbage island. Appropriate to say? Probably not. Defendable? Arguably yes. 


>the dems made all sorts of false claims about Russian interference which went absolutely nowhere.

There was an investigation, In case you didn't hear, trump was found to have colluded with Russia and interfered with the 2016 election. It was a whole [report](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/) even. 

>Kamala criticized all of trumps policies and is now copying them, border wall, tax cut on tips, fracking and many other things.

As mentioned in my prior comment, I actually agree. Kamala has moved significantly right in her policies.

And for the sake of argument, even if hypothetically Pelosi had the power to force Biden to leave the race (she doesn't), why would she be the bad guy here for getting someone with dementia to drop?

"> Now if only we could secure the most obvious, basic, and universal measure that every other country with a legitimate democracy has: voter ID requirements.

The problem is that Republicans oppose any sort of national ID, and they keep trying to pass laws with *highly restrictive* voter ID requirements. 

In Texas they were so aggressive about it that the law was struck down for targeting black voters ""with surgical precision."" 

In North Carolina a strict voter ID law was struck down after one of the people involved died, and a whistleblower (their kid IIRC) published emails in which they were discussing how to find changes they could implement that would disproportionately target black voters. 

Stricter voter ID laws have also gone hand-in-hand with closing DMV offices in areas with a lot of black voters, so that getting the necessary ID becomes more expensive and more time consuming for them. IIRC that was the case for both TX and NC. 

I expect a national voter ID law [along the lines of what Canada requires](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&dir=ids&document=index&lang=e) would get broad Democratic support. Note how many combinations of documents are accepted. It's a law designed to validate identities, not disproportionately discourage a certain demographic.

"I know the presidential election polls in NC are *tight* right now, but I really don't see how Democrat Josh Stein can be leading Mark Robinson by 15 points and Trump can still win North Carolina. I know North Carolina voters have split their tickets between Governor and President plenty of times in the past, with the Democrat winning the governor's race and the Republican winning the presidential race, but usually, the results for the gubernatorial election are much closer (for instance incumbent Governor Roy Cooper won by 0.2% in 2016 and 4.5% in 2020).

> Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein continues to lead Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson by double digits in the race for North Carolina governor, a WRAL News Poll released Wednesday shows - a marked gap, considering the race for president is tied in this battleground state.

> The WRAL poll shows nearly one in every five Trump supporters backing Stein for governor.

> WRAL&#039;s latest poll, conducted after the Elon and Marist polls - and which shows almost no change in support for either Stein or Robinson since before that CNN report - suggests that some voters who had cooled on Robinson may have moved past the allegations.

"He and Silicon Valley Tech Bros. They want to crash the US to pieces so they can came come in a post Soviet type crash buy up at cheap. And enslave us. (with them in charge of course.) Theil and JD Vance as well.  First is their John the Baptist. Yarvin. 

Here. https://newrepublic.com/article/183971/jd-vance-weird-terrifying-techno-authoritarian-ideas

“Yarvin is the chief thinker behind an obscure but increasingly influential far-right neoreaction, or NRx, movement, that some call the “Dark Enlightenment.” Among other things, it openly promotes dictatorships as superior to democracies and views nations like the United States as *outdated software systems. Yarvin seeks to reengineer governments by breaking them up into smaller entities called “patchworks,” which would be controlled by tech corporations.*

“The basic idea of Patchwork is that, as the crappy governments we inherited from history are smashed, they should be replaced by a global spiderweb of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of sovereign and independent mini-countries, each governed by its own joint-stock corporation without regard to the residents’ opinions,” he wrote in Patchwork: A Political System for the 21st Century.

Each patchwork would be ruled by a “realm”: a corporation with absolute power. Citizens would be free to move, but every other realm would also be ruled by corporate governments with chilling impunity. For example, Yarvin says the tech overlords of the San Francisco realm could arbitrarily decide to cut off its citizens’ hands with no fear of legal consequences—because they’re a sovereign power, beholden to no federal government or laws.”

Now let’s go deeper.   Oligarchs.   Elon has been in talking with V. Putin. Why?  I think advice how to line things up like he did post Soviet collapse.  Let’s remember that Vlad is an absolute enemy of US and was emasculated by the Fall.  Totally in his motives to do to  US what the West did to him. 

So the Tech Bros want a new government. Something more us-them / everyone is an employee.  Thiel has stated many times he wants a Golden Rule place where only those with gold rule. Seasteading. He talked about a floating county where he could do anything he wanted. Literally. (At one time he was linked with under age male escorts on a boat in the ocean. He claimed “international waters”’or such.) 
And JD is a puppet of Theil.  Maybe a “oh no. Trump fall off balcony. Guess I’m in charge now,” intrigue.

"Elon Musk is talking about an economic downturn due to a massive government spending cut. The idea is that to balance the budget and to top an increase in debt, the government must slash spending. And he's right when he says that this will lead to a an economic downturn that will eventually turn into a recovery.

The thing is, though, that spending cuts aren't the only way to balance the budget. Another way is to raise taxes. If taxes were raised on the rich, and not raised on the poor, then the economic effect would still be same - an economic downturn followed by a recovery. However, if you take away money from the rich, you'll end up tanking the stock market. This is because the rich are more likely to save and invest any excess money they get, while the poor are more likely to spend any excess money they get.

In short, raising taxes does *less* damage to society and to the economy than cutting government spending.

Also note that there is a clear correlation between the introduction of tax cuts for the rich and an increase in government debt levels. This can been seen from the early 1980s onwards.",2024_10_31

Even infamous neoliberal bastions like the IMF have taken a pretty firm stance that austerity is *bad* for debt sustainability at this point. As you say, it causes the deficit to increase, but it also shrinks the economy so the pre-existing debt is now a greater % of GDP than it already was.

Austerity is ideological - if it was ever implemented with genuine goals of debt reduction, it's not the case now. Conservatives introduce austerity to achieve political goals (shrinking the state, hurting minorities).

There’s already countless institutions and means by which someone established in business can acquire loans to invest in new ventures or pursue new projects in existing ones so if the idea was truly that revolutionary, why wouldn’t they be pursuing it by those means instead of waiting for a tax cut? 

Additionally When and where tax cuts are used to invest, they almost never are used to fund projects and such.

I would just like to add for anybody who thinks ""ok a recession would be bad, but at least our debt would drop"" - the assertion that cutting government spending leads to reduced government debt is at best debatable.

IMF research in recent years has shown that government austerity generally leads to minimal reduction in debt or even an increase in debt, because while spending goes down, government revenue also tanks due to the damage done to the economy. I would honestly expect US government debt to increase as a result of this, meaning the economy has gone through a major recession and government services have collapsed to the benefit of precisely nobody who isn't already obscenely rich.",2024_10_31

It is also worth considering the potential consequences of eliminating key government departments, such as the Department of Education, as has been suggested. Such a move could have devastating long-term effects on American society.

His message has loudly been that America = garbage = bad, and he's going to ""fix"" it.

So it just creates a mixed message.  He's there to clean up the trash.  But he's surrounded by supporters dressed as trash.

It's dumb to tout yourself as the guy who will clean up the garbage, at the same time as your supporters are trying to claim the label ""garbage"" as some point of pride.

This was very much like taking the first covid vaccine except the later was probably better tested and my parents were thrilled that I got it since one of my sisters was wearing leg braces due to the disease.

Since I have received many other vaccines and have only had a few mild reactions.  Sure, sometimes things go south for a few, but the great majority of us and our families have been saved great suffering and death.

These folks are demagogues. Some indeed believe their our lies, others know better, and some are a mix. But the point is to exploit fear and ignorance, create scape goats, and so on to gain power.

"HURR CHEATING.  Let's see, why are people standing in line to just request a ballot.

Ohhhh.... In 2019, the Pennsylvania Legislature, then controlled by Republicans, passed a law creating a system for early voting different from most states. It allows registered voters to go to their county elections office, request a mail ballot, and fill out an application. Once that is reviewed, the ballot is printed. They can then fill it out and turn it in during that visit or return it by mail or place it in a drop box.

Lines have been long because that process can take about 10 to 12 minutes per voter, Bucks County Board of Elections Chairman Bob Harvie told CBS News.

""It is a very cumbersome process. We don't have limitless resources here. We have a fixed number of staff. We have a fixed budget,"" Harvie said.

GOT IT!  So the voter suppression is working as intended, but it's happening in a republican county, so trump has to sue to fix the voter suppression by claiming its voter suppression.",2024_10_31

Vote. Your country depends on it.",2024_10_31

These claims of fraud have been disproven time and time again.  What's really hilarious is that the majority of any election fraud that has been discovered was committed by republican voters that were found guilty of illegally voting more than once in the last two presidential elections.

> After pocketing the ballots, Savage leaned over to a woman streaming the event on Facebook Live, telling her that there was a &quot;Fucked-up count.&quot; Upon exiting, Savage approached a man outside the government facility and showed him the ballots in his pocket before the unidentified man patted him on his back.

> Last week, Trump issued his first call to arms for the 2024 race, preemptively claiming on Truth Social that the November election is already rigged, mere days into early voting.

"WE NEVER HAD THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE TRUMP.

Just remember that.

>The campaign did not point to any instance in particular that led it to believe that voters had been treated unfairly in Bucks County, but county officials had observed that there were complaints on social media (shared by the Trump campaign) about long lines to obtain mail-in ballots on Tuesday, the last day of their availability. Due to a miscommunication, some voters believed they could not have their mail-in ballot requests accommodated, Bucks County officials wrote on X, noting that that information was incorrect and that all voters who had joined the line before 5 p.m. would be able to receive a mail-in ballot.

>But Trump chose to stoke the flames Wednesday morning, posting on Truth Social that “Pennsylvania is cheating, and getting caught, at large scale levels rarely seen before.”

Didn't Donald Trump say for years that none of his voters should use mail-in ballots? Yet, here we are. In any case, there was a miscommunication and people got the wrong idea, but Bucks County accommodated everyone who got on line before 5pm.

"Pennsylvania is one of seven states that does not allow election workers to begin processing absentee or mail ballots until 7 a.m. Election Day. This means workers across the commonwealth must deal with these ballots at the same time the polls are open, functionally running two elections at once, which can cause delays in unofficial results being available.

Much has changed since 2020. County election directors have more experience with the state’s mail voting law, passed in 2019. Counties have also received millions of dollars to supplement their election budgets from a state-funded grant program. Those dollars have been used, in some cases, to purchase machines to more quickly open and sort mail ballots.

Most are embarrassed by his hateful crimes and what he did to the world. To display a Swastika is illegal. Many Germans died because of Hitler. Believe me when I say most would go to war against the NAZIS. They know it is a stain on their history, and almost every German I know or can think of hates with a passion... Donald Trump. They recognize and smell the same bs Hitler spoke of, vermin, the enemy within, the others. They tried multiple times to remove Hitler from power. In the end, it was his own hand that sealed his fate. Just like it will be Donald Trumps actions this coming Nov 5 that will decide his. He knows defeat is at hand. The enemy from within is going to vote him out. He can sense defeat and is becoming increasingly desperate. This is just the start. Be strong America. As a veteran, I ask you to stand brave in the face of tyranny and fulfill your destiny. Take your rightful place as that shining beacon on the hill once mentioned by a former republican president.

If he loses, ""it was stolen.""  If he wins, ""I would have won the popular vote.""  If he wins that, ""I would have won by more.""

If he won 150 million votes to one, he would still claim that one vote was fraud.

These lawsuits against states, even when 'frivolous' or completely under false pretenses is that they are fought by the state. This means these lawsuits actively siphon public TAX-PAYER funds away from the services they could otherwise be put towards.

Not only is Trump filing bullshit lawsuits, he is actively wasting tax dollars with every single one solely to inflate his ego and peddle this idea that the election is 'being stolen'. So especially in states where tax dollars may not amount to a whole lot, he is taking money that could be spent on constituents from them and preventing them from having better services provided by the state. 

If they're expensive enough, he can even turn around and talk about how the states aren't using taxes on the public and constantly wasting money and his base will eat it up, despite the fact that he is part of the reason the state has even less to spend on things such as infrastructure and social goods",2024_10_31

But unlike the person you replied to, I don't think it's very widespread. I live in VA and no one I know or am remotely connected with had anything wrong with their registration (to my knowledge). 

Allegedly it's about 1,600 people that were flagged and removed using the above criteria. Some people are upset that it's mainly affecting people in some of the most left-leaning counties in the state, but those counties are also some of the most populous so it's not that strange of a coincidence imo.

Even if someone was mistakenly removed when they should not have been, Virginia has same-day voter registration, so you could in theory register to vote on Election Day itself and be fine.

"Voting for a candidate who opposes your core values—even if they seem like the ""lesser evil""—is inherently compromising of your integrity. And it reinforces harmful policies that diminish meaningful political choice. Harris has stated she was involved in all of the major decisions of Biden and she stated she wouldn't have done much differently. She may not be as hard core Zionist as Biden, but she's made clear that Jewish lives count for more than Arab ones and that she unequivocally supports the far right Netanyahu government. 

So by supporting someone who stands against your interests, you may inadvertently normalize values you oppose, which weakens your moral stance and which can erode your credibility. How do you maintain a moral credibility voting for someone that is supporting a government that is engaging in ethnic cleansing? Voting for candidates that are against your interests and values also risks entrenching a system that forces voters into narrow, negative choices, allowing politicians to ignore real concerns by banking on fear of ""the other side."" And that's exactly what has happened in this election.

Instead, abstaining from a harmful choice can send a powerful message. It asserts the demand for genuine representation and challenges a system where only marginally different options are presented. In the long run, this strategy can create space for alternatives and strengthen democracy by insisting that political choices reflect true values, not just the ""lesser evil.""


Voting under the ""threat"" of  Trump presidency ultimately validates a system that exploits fear rather than offering genuine choices. Accepting this cycle can lead to continuously supporting candidates who don’t represent your values, as the system never faces the pressure to change.

Moreover, a political stance built on fear is inherently unsustainable and vulnerable. Lasting change often requires principled stands, even if they’re risky or unpopular in the short term. By withholding support from those who harm your interests, you’re challenging the system to prioritize genuine solutions over mere expediency, opening the door for future options that align with your beliefs and aspirations. Sometimes, true progress demands a willingness to resist the immediate pressure for the sake of a better path forward.",2024_10_31

"What does good actually look like for the Palestinians? Let's be realistic.

They had an excellent opportunity for peace at the Camp David Accords and Arafat and his leadership walked away fearing assassination for giving up the Palestinian the right to return. That group of Palestinian leaders is the closest they've ever had to real statesmen who could build a country.

I’m not condoning what Israel/Bibi has done to prevent a two state solution since 2003. It’s bad for Israel and the Palestinians and wrong. The Israel's have absolutely built an apartheid state. But in doing so they did end the terrorist threat that flared up in the West Bank after the Palestinians rejected Camp David.

Since then terrorism has overwhelmed the Palestinian ability to self-govern and find peace in Gaza. But what do you do when the terrorists are democratically elected and keep being terrorists?

I'm not saying they all are in this position, but what do you do with the only ""refugee"" population in the world legally allowed to inheret their refugee status while never having even visited Palestine and living in peace in other countries? What do you do with a population that will only accept peace via the right to return (and thus demanding the destruction of the Israeli state) through inherence? It doesn't exist anywhere else in the world and is what perpetuates this conflict.

I respect Palestinian agency and will not infantilize them. The Palestinians know exactly what they are doing supporting Hamas and rejecting the Palestinian Authority. The UN has uniquely given the Palestinians every reason to wait out the Israeli's and continue applying pain through terrorism in a legal structure the UN has denied every other victimized group in the world.

It's not a conflict the Palestinians will ever win, but they can keep it going forever.

In response, what the Israelis have done is allow themselves to survive this Palestinian refusal for a durable and separate peace in perpetuity by creating an apartheid state in the West Bank. They've made themselves mostly invulnerable to terrorism in the West Bank and we're now watching them do the same in Gaza.

I'm not saying that bringing West Bank style apartheid occupation to Gaza is right or ""peace."" But it would be the first time since 2006 that Gaza would have a chance to be ruled by the Palestinian Authority again and not a terrorist organization. It'll be the first time in a long time that a terrorist organization wasn't the core of their economy.

No final peace can happen until the PA has total control of Gaza and Hamas is ended not just by Israeli violence but also the Palestinian desire to be governed by the organization that can be their national government if they allow it to be and accept that they will never return to what is now Israel.

If you don't believe it's reasonable to demand Palestinians give up their right to return in exchange for statehood, then we'll continue seeing this play out until our kids are old and gray. Anyone who believes that it is possible to have a power sharing government between Jews and Muslims is ignoring the history of Lebanon, whose chance for peace is even more remote than Palestine's

US aid (in the form of weapons sales) has less impact than people think. Israel’s domestic arms industry is enormous and top notch. If Biden did what people demand and cut off US weapons, we would lose much of what little leverage we have left over them forever, just like the Germans and Italians have. It’s inevitable and will happen anyway in the next 5-10 years. The Israel’s have gotten the message from US politics and are already building the infrastructure they need to be minimally impacted by a future US President who tries to control Israeli policy via weapons sales. All our aid will be good for then is US domestic job creation and balancing the Israeli budget.

The only way out of this perpetual cycle is enabling the Palestinians to choose a durable peace when they have NEVER chosen peace since the 1930s. Wiping out Hamas and Hezbollah and establishing an apartheid state in Gaza are only the prerequisites to getting back on the path to real diplomacy. Otherwise we'll just keep seeing the same shit happen forever.

It sucks and I don't think it's right. I'm just being pragmatic.",2024_10_31

Their own families think it's a good thing to die a martyr. They are martyrs. It's a good thing. Get it? 

The reality is you don't give a shit. Hamas don't give a shit. Hezbolla don't give a shit. Their parents don't give a shit. Israeli give more of a shit than all of yall. There is a reason why in Israel there is a protest against the war every single day. While nobody in Gaza gave any single fuck to stop Hamas. 

There is a reason why they are multiple of videos of little Palestinian kids spitting on dead Israeli girls. There is a reason why the UNRWA and the UN and teachers in Gaza are teaching little children to hate Jewish people. There is a reason why they are attack on Jewish people all over the world. That has nothing to do with the conflict other than being Jewish. 

Hamas and Sunni extremism has to be stopped. This ideology is absolutely a humanity killer. It has to be wiped out. Full stop. The Arab and Palestinian people, which mind you, are 20% of Israel PROPER. Not the west bank people getting work in Israel but actually 20% of them being Arab, Muslim, Palestinian etc. They deserve better than people like you. They deserve better than Hamas, They deserve better than Hezbollah, they deserve better than Iran, they deserve better than Bibi and the extremist in Israel. 

You are not helpful. Trying to hurt America isn't the way to go. Trying to hurt Israel isn't the way to go, trying to be what bibi believe you are, which mind you, you are. Is not the way to go. 

Palestinian receive most aids per capita than anything possible. It is unimaginable. They deserve better, they deserved their cities built, their school built, their hospital built. They could thrive without people like you, supporting Hamas. Because that is who you support. 

There is no genocide in Gaza, there is no genocide in Lebanon, they are genocide in other places in the world though, which nobody actually care. Which is WEIRD... But you know, it's not Jewish people doing it. Curious. :) 

They are genocidal people that are Israeli, they even have some in their government. The genocide is not happening though. It is sad that innocent are dying, it shouldn't be happening but it is because of Hamas, because the people that lost, do not want to accept it. Look, The Palestinian tried multiple times for over 70+ years. They lost. Every other Arab countries lost. They lost. That's it. Settle and take a deal. Whatever deal you get is better than fighting. Except these people actually want to genocide the Jews. Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran and all other Sunni Muslim extremist wants to genocide Jewish people.  

Everyone from Palestinian kids that were failed by their parents, by their religion, from every Israeli stuck into this infinite conflict because they're Jewish.

"As for core values, I can only speak for myself. But it's clear Harris does not view all lives as being equal. When asked about the atrocious death toll and destruction waged on the Palestinian people by Israel, she responded by saying *""the first and most tragic story is October 7 and what happened on that day"".* That was revealing because it crystalized how she views this. 45,000 plus Palestinians dead, including a majority of women and children but she says the ""the most"" tragic story is the 1200 Israelis that were killed. 

It's 100% clear to anyone that cares to pay attention that Israel is engaging in [ethnic cleansing in the north of Gaza](https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20241022_the_world_must_stop_the_ethnic_cleansing_of_northern_gaza). They are literally rounding people up under threat of death, [separating the women and children from the men](https://youtu.be/ORgVPO8OSis?si=s-XPbhp30wtvHpjO) and loading them into buses. We can only imagine what happens to the men or ""terrorists"" as Israel is calling them. This is literally what the Serbs did in Srebrenica, Bosnia - which caused outrage across the western world. And the response of Harris to this has been to affirm her commitment to Israel. And to approve of sending more weapons. I can't stress enough just how diametrically opposed this position is to my values. How can any government justify this kind of dehumanizing treatment of innocent Palestinians? And Harris isn't just not opposing it, she is tacitly at least supporting it. 

The reality is there is almost no choice in this election when it comes to the middle east. Across the board, there are few politicians in Washington that dare oppose Israel. But voting for someone that is not actively resisting or using their position to try and stop the violence and death being waged on innocent women and children is just unbearable. It would undermine every core value I hold dear. And it would, in my opinion, just affirm a system that provides no choice on this issue. 

 Responsibility in a democracy goes beyond simply choosing the least harmful candidate. Real responsibility involves standing for values, demanding accountability, and pushing the system toward genuine representation. Voting solely out of fear of the “greater evil” may seem practical, but it can also perpetuate a cycle of harmful choices and lower the bar for what’s acceptable in leadership.

True democratic responsibility might mean resisting candidates who oppose your values, even if it feels risky in the short term, and supporting alternatives that better align with a just and ethical society. This stance can pave the way for meaningful change and a system that respects the principles of those it represents, rather than one that relies on fear to secure votes.",2024_10_31

Have you ever had to [amputate your niece's limbs](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-doctor-amputates-nieces-leg-home-without-anaesthesia-2024-01-19/) with no anaesthesia?

You talk about privilege?? Harris, as the current Vice President, is actively involved in an administration that is actively arming, financing and defending all of these actions. They aren't idle bystanders, they are participants. 

You talk about willingness to compromise? Is it a reasonable or rationale action to suggest someone should be willing to compromise on supporting the genocide and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and the killing of tens of thousands of children, so that people in the US have a slightly better heathcare system or paid maternity leave? Is that honestly what your are suggesting? And you want to talk about privilege....",2024_10_31
"Yes Harris has said she wants a ceasefire. That's honestly empty rhetoric. As the current VP and the presumptive next President, she could advocate for how she will enforce a ceasefire. Because clearly that would need to happen under pressure. There is absolutely nothing that indicates that a President Harris will do anything to enforce a ceasefire. Since her calls for a ceasefire she has effectively supported Israel's expanding the war in Lebanon and she has supported Israel's escalations with Iran. So it really is empty talk. The same applies to her saying she wants a two state solution. It's not just empty rhetoric it's much worse than that because her administration has actively armed and supported the government that has openly said it's against a two state solution and it's actions are designed to ensure there can never be a two state solution. Saying you want something but then doing everything that supports the opposite is, in some respects actually worse than just coming out and saying you support Israel's intent to annex and settle Gaza. Because it's duplicitous. And it prevents an honest debate. Saying you care about Palestinian lives counts for nothing if you are arming and supporting the people that are destroying Palestinians lives.

And when it comes to harm reduction, my argument is that real harm reduction isn’t always achieved by choosing between two negative options. When a system continually forces people to pick the “lesser evil,” it signals that accountability and ethical leadership are secondary to maintaining power. By refusing to validate harmful candidates, you’re demanding higher standards and creating pressure for the system to offer real, positive choices that don’t rely on exploiting fear.

Choosing a principled stance doesn’t mean ignoring the risks, but rather acknowledging that breaking the cycle of fear-based voting is essential for long-term harm reduction. If we want real harm reduction, we need to shift the political landscape toward leaders who actually act - and we promote accountability and integrity over expedience. My argument is that Democrats embracing of expediency in this two party system over many decades has played a large role in creating an environment that has ultimately opened the door to candidates like Trump. That needs to end.",2024_10_31
"I respectfully disagree that it's people's responsibility in a democracy to chose the lesser of two evils. I'm arguing that's it's this very thing that has opened the door to candidates like Trump. We have seemingly bought into the idea of political expediency where values of accountability and ethics are pushed to the side. It's in this environment that people like Trump thrive. 

 Responsibility in a democracy goes beyond simply choosing the least harmful candidate. Real responsibility involves standing for values, demanding accountability, and pushing the system toward genuine representation. Voting solely out of fear of the “greater evil” may seem practical, but it can also perpetuate a cycle of harmful choices and lower the bar for what’s acceptable in leadership. And that's what has happened. In 2016, the Democratic Party rigged the system to push forward Hillary Clinton, who is the very embodiment of expedient Washington politics. That opened the door to the first Trump Presidency. The same is happening now with Harris, who was seen as a terrible candidate in 2019, where she didn't even finish in the top 10. But now Democrat power players decided she would be the candidate - excluding any democratic process. It's become a race to the bottom. The question is, should we be participating in that race to the bottom because of fear?

Real harm reduction isn’t always achieved by choosing between two negative options. When a system continually forces people to pick the “lesser evil,” it signals that accountability and ethical leadership are secondary to maintaining power. The entire ""Vote Blue, No Matter Who"" campaign is designed to entrench political power in the few and unaccountable. By refusing to validate poor or harmful candidates, you’re demanding higher standards and creating pressure for the system to offer real, positive choices that don’t rely on exploiting fear.

The question all Democrat voters need to ask is how to break the cycle of fear-based voting that is essential for long-term harm reduction, especially when it comes to the US Government supporting things like genocide and the mass slaughter of children.

By refusing to vote for candidates that don't represent your values, it can help shift the political landscape toward leaders who actually respect and represent your values ultimately reducing harm by promoting accountability and integrity over expedience.",2024_10_31

"I firmly agree that what the Israelis are currently doing is ethnic cleansing. I also agree that the Israelis have been and are still executing a policy of Lebensraum.

I'm not saying it's ok, because it's not. But there is no justice in this situation. There's been too much history and injustice for both sides since the late 1800s to ever end this in a way that feels fair. Wars are not settled through fairness, they're settled by projecting power. The Palestinians use birth rates and terrorism, the Israels use the most modern military in the world and loose RoEs.

Israel has built one of the most modern, innovative, and globalized economies in the world. US economic integration with Israel is a not small part of how we stay ahead ourselves economically and militarily. We receive more new military tech from Israel than people realize.

At the same time the global Jewish population has still not returned to pre-Holocaust levels (it's expected to in the 2050s). Meanwhile fascism and anti-Semitism are on the rise. The US will always ensure there is a Jewish homeland and thus Israel's right to exist.

For these reasons and more it's fantasy to believe that the US and Israel will ever decouple.

The Israelis will always be allowed to do what they need to to end Palestinian terrorism, even when they do it the wrong way. But don't forget Bibi is Israel's Trump and is hanging on to power to stay out of jail. The current approach is temporary. Eventually we'll see sanity in Israeli leadership again.

Of course there is no one you can vote for directly that represents you right now. But that is why practicality is important. You have to think about which candidate, would lead to a greater likelihood of eventually budging. I.e. since you cannot achieve the result with the election on the surface, which candidate is more likely to potentially do the thing when there are enough calls for it. 

As in, under whose presidency could protests against the war be more successful? Which party is more likely to change in the desired direction? Which one can be held accountable after being elected.

"idg people acting like Kamala and dems are so much better on this. Biden is in the white house. An arms embargo is popular among voters of both parties, even more so among the progressive wing of “the left”. Instead of making any change in policy to capture votes, it’s been a year of finger wagging “well we told Israel not to do that”, then sending more weapons and money and even having our troops help in committing some of the atrocities. They are more interested in continuing a genocide than winning, judging by their own actions.

People seem fine with moving to the right to capture voters and endorsements from republican leaders who have been chipping away at our rights for decades, but not with pressuring their dem leaders to move left and **stop a fucking genocide**. And then have the audacity to say “one issue voters” have a superiority complex. I’ll wear it. I AM better than them. Opposing genocide should be a hard line and anyone not willing to make themselves uncomfortable to do so or assume some risk trying to stop it does not value human life equally, point blank. 

Palestine is more than one issue. It encompasses all the issues the far left care about (reproductive rights, racism, climate change, anti-colonialism and imperialism, etc.), and we’ve seen ending the genocide, and addressing those problems tied to it, is not a priority for the leadership in this country. We’ve seen what peacefully organizing and protesting against a genocide looks like under a democratic administration and where it’s gotten us (nowhere)(property crime is not violence). What other non-violent option have they given us than the threat of withholding power from them? Kamala literally equated saving Palestinian lives to lessening the cost groceries, and I’m supposed to believe it will be easier to organize under her after she gets elected????? 🥴🤡

If Trump wins the election and all the democrats worst fears come true about the changes he’ll implement, I expect them to side with fascists or bury their head in the sand before standing toe to toe with them to defend marginalized and oppressed communities here, their comments prove they have no real principles or the conviction to stand behind them. They sound like selfish cowards tbh.

It's actually funny to me that you have never experienced any suffering within your own country, have no lived experience with it but basically are telling people they support genocide if they vote for Harris (instead of actually realizing there are also real issues at stake for real people here in the US - not just the real tragedies for real people in Gaza). Thanks for referring me to news articles of things you have never experienced. Clearly I was on the money based on your response. Where is your outrage over the persecution over the Uyghurs' in China, war crimes against the Ukrainians, the condition of migrant detainees in the US? I could list more social injustices that I don't see you advocating for as a moral purist. As a nurse- I have seen many traumas, and unlike you I don't consider one human suffering over another, nor am I selective where I empathize. ""A slightly better health care system"" - WOW ultimate privilege and ignorance. Better paid maternity leave? LOL try any for some of us. Also - 17  children were murdered at my high school because of our inability to solve gun violence, so there's that. If you step outside your little bubble - you might be able to see the forest beyond the trees. But that requires self reflection and having life experience. Also - you can hold the pain of the Palestinian people and Jewish people - acknowledge the horrible situation, while still voting for the candidate that will better issues in your own country and have MUCH BETTER chance of aiding in bettering issues in the Middle East - instead of no chance at all. 

You are clearly someone who wants to portray themself as a ""social justice warrior"" when you have absolutely no idea what that means. You are simply a morally outraged poser who reads news articles and takes up the latest social media cause they have limited understanding of - all while shitting on people suffering in their own country because obviously if your house isn't getting blown up by a missile - then you have no right to complain. Also shows your VERY limited understanding of the issues right around you and total lack of empathy. 

Enjoy casting your protest vote or not voting at all. I am sure it will bring about monumental change in the future. Seems to be about the only ""contribution"" you are making to bettering society - or at least you can tell yourself that.

*edit to clarify for those who chose not to read my statement in full - that I do in fact think the Palestinians are real people suffering a great tragedy; while acknowledging there are real people in the US in close proximity suffering great tragedies too.

"I mentioned above the reasons why we will only push that button so much and shouldn't expect any US President to do it now. Our military aid to Israel is already mostly a domestic jobs program and this capacity will be built up domestically in Israel over the next 5-10 years.

The Israelis have every reason to prove to the world that the US denying them weapons is not an effective way of changing their behavior. They will do anything to accomplish this because they need to define a new narrative for themselves without us and show they are just as strong going solo while the US arms industry reports layoffs.

We of course should expect them to rapidly accelerate building out gaps in their domestic arms manufacturing capabilities.

But more immediately, one change we should expect from this is more aggressive Israeli bombing in Lebanon and Iran to prevent missile launches, as we deliver quite a bit of their precision missile self-defense munitions. The Israelis also produce most of their own unguided muntions, so forcing them to ration their domestic precision weapons will result in *more* civilian deaths in Gaza than we're seeing now.

In fact, knowing the Israelis, I believe we should expect them to intentionally turn up the slaughter by immediately ceasing use of precision weapons and moving to unguided in Gaza just to embarrass the US.

But let's assume that we cut them off anyway and they do the above. What do you think can be done to get the Israelis and Palestinians both on a path to peace when neither want to?

I'm not trying to be a smart ass or pain by asking. I'm super curious what someone with your perspective thinks is achievable.",2024_10_31

We have thousands of nukes and the most massive and advanced military on earth with an infinite reach over everything. All that economic power? They can’t afford to lose access. We can easily afford to lose Israel. There are 15 other allies in the region and we control the world economy.

The threat of losing that will end the war. It would end the colonization. No state is so arrogant and idiotic that they’d risk all of that.

Once the chain has been yanked and Israel has come to heel, the Palestinians would be happy to engage in talks with the US as mediator at that point. There would be nobody else more credible on earth at that point. They might even feel safe and secure enough to deliver us Hamas. Otherwise Hamas would likely see some sort of deradicalization which, to me, is acceptable.

Again: we’re Rome. We are The Empire. We do whatever we want, to whomever we want, whenever we want. The bully of bullies. If Israel wants to continue to exist as ostensibly a US vassal state then it needs to play by US rules of conduct.

Let's try something - let's ask AI what it says about voting for the lesser of two evils:

................

**Explain this: Voting for the 'lesser of two evils' always shifts the dial towards evil.**  

The phrase ""voting for the 'lesser of two evils' always shifts the dial towards evil"" suggests that when people consistently choose a candidate or option they perceive as less harmful rather than one they genuinely support, it can lead to a normalization of undesirable choices in politics. Here’s a breakdown of this idea:  
1. Choice Limitation: When voters settle for the lesser evil, they reinforce a system where only two main candidates or options are viable. This can discourage new candidates or ideas from emerging.   
2. Moral Compromise: By voting for someone who is not fully aligned with their values, voters may feel they are compromising their principles. This can lead to disillusionment and apathy towards the political process.  
3. Encouraging Negative Traits: If candidates realize that they only need to be ""less evil"" to win votes, they may focus on appealing to base instincts rather than promoting positive change. This can perpetuate a cycle of negative campaigning and governance.  
4. Long-Term Impact: Over time, consistently opting for the lesser evil can create a political environment where harmful practices become more accepted or expected, making it harder to advocate for better alternatives.  

In essence, the argument suggests that while voting for the lesser of two evils might seem pragmatic in the short term, it can have detrimental effects on the political landscape and on society's values in the long run.

**Is it true?**  

Whether the statement is true can depend on individual perspectives and experiences with political systems. Here are some points to consider:  
1. Political System Dynamics: In many electoral systems, especially those dominated by two major parties, voting for the lesser evil can lead to a lack of diversity in political representation. This can reinforce the status quo and limit the emergence of new ideas or candidates.   
2. Voter Disillusionment: Many voters report feeling disillusioned when their choices do not align with their values. This discontent can lead to decreased voter turnout, which may further entrench undesirable candidates or policies in power.   
3. Historical Examples: There are historical instances where voting for the lesser evil has led to negative outcomes, such as the perpetuation of harmful policies or practices. However, there are also cases where such votes have prevented worse outcomes.   
4. Individual Responsibility: Some argue that voters have a responsibility to actively seek and support candidates who represent their values, rather than settling for the lesser evil. This perspective emphasizes the importance of grassroots movements and third-party candidates.   

Ultimately, whether it is ""true"" that voting for the lesser of two evils shifts the dial towards evil is subjective and can vary based on individual beliefs, experiences, and the specific political context.

...............

So - in summary it's about 'individual beliefs, experiences, and the specific political context.'  And neither of us can control that can we?  However - Harris can swing the dial but seems unwilling to do so.",2024_10_31

3. Fixation with perceived national decline, humiliation, or victimhood.

4. White Replacement “Theory” used to show that democratic ideals of freedom and equality are a threat.
Oppose any initiatives or institutions that are racially, ethnically, or religiously harmonious.

5. Disdain for human rights while seeking purity and cleansing for those they define as part of the nation.

6. Identification of “enemies”/scapegoats as a unifying cause. Imprison and/or murder opposition and minority group leaders.

7. Supremacy of the military and embrace of paramilitarism in an uneasy, but effective
collaboration with traditional elites. Fascists arm people and justify and glorify violence as “redemptive”.

8. Rampant sexism.

9. Control of mass media and undermining “truth”.

10. Obsession with national security, crime and punishment, and fostering a sense of the nation under attack.

11. Religion and government are intertwined.

12. Corporate power is protected and labor power is suppressed.

13. Disdain for intellectuals and the arts not aligned with the fascist narrative.

I’ve canvassed for elections in Canada here. Our political machines got nothing on America’s and I’m a noob. The most I’ve done was ~30 doors in 2.5 hours. 1000 doors a week is…. what???,2024_10_31
"For some context, I worked on a race in 2022. Splitting my time between Door Knocking and phone calls, I was expected to knock 50 doors a day, 6 days a week. If these guys are working 7 days a week, 8 hour shifts, they could only hit their goal if they knocked a door every 3.35 minutes, for 8 hours straight, without a break. Physically impossible anyone is actually hitting these numbers.",2024_10_31
"Someone on r/VoteDem set this exact goal for themselves. It’s been like a three month journey. Admittedly they’re a volunteer and have a different full-time job, but it was still a big deal. Doing that in a week would be crazy.",2024_10_31
Trump's campaign has been so low on funds for so long they basically bailed on the ground effort part. Just rallies where they leave unpaid bills. That's why this last ditch half-assed canvassing scam fell to Elon. The whole thing smells funny and would land people in prison in any functioning democracy.,2024_10_31
"Trump doesn’t have a ground game, signs of badly ran campaign",2024_10_31
I'm on this too. This sounds like a Macy's parade balloon of a campaign: Empty except for hot gas. You can't fuckin win if you don't do jack shit.,2024_10_31
It's always projection with these morons.,2024_10_31
The article states the canvassers weren't aware it was for Trump/Musk/Republican party until after they signed the NDA,2024_10_31
"What makes you think these people didn't get seminars? The only difference is they were shitty power point presentations on a too small tv in an overcrowded room rather than a 80s apple commercial.

The dystopian cyber punk is here and now. It just doesn't have anything cyber or punk about it.",2024_10_31
Yup,2024_10_31
I can't imagine the polls are accurate. If this article is 10% accurate it's going to be the worst ground game ever run by a campaign.,2024_10_31
Use archive.ph to get around it.  Its not that hard. ,2024_10_31
"Very few people I’ve canvassed feel that way, tho I did have one guy tell me what I was doing was dangerous and what if his wife or 16-year old daughter were home alone when I knocked on his door. Plus a lot of people in our area at least have Ring cameras and a few of them are probably home but don’t answer the door. 

You can always tell the canvasser you’re not interested in participating, they’ll thank you and note Refused in the app which will alert the campaign not to come to your house again. 

This is the Harris campaign; I have no idea how the other side is trained.",2024_10_31
"Can confidently say I’ll never buy a Tesla, I’ll look at a Rivian, Ioniq or something else when I go to get one",2024_10_31

This makes him potentially far more dangerous than anyone else working with Trump.",2024_10_31
He's even made me pretty sceptical of Starlink too.,2024_10_31

"Could just be hoping to make the base feel paranoid that they will be persecuted, but equally he may have been engaging in a whole lot of serious criminal activity and failed to conceal the fact.

The FBI know he's been talking to Putin in private on a regular basis for the past two years, and though it is unlikely he has access to anything even vaguely relevant to national defence at SpaceX, they probably weren't having cozy chats about futurology or jawline implants.

Even if no criminality there, who knows what else he may have been up to, and he may even be aware of ongoing investigations into his activities.",2024_10_31

Something more serious is driving his lunacy.",2024_10_31

"Never forget: Trump's first lie following his inauguration was to claim he had the biggest inaugural crowd size — not just bigger than Obama, but bigger than any President in history... Without evidence.

And all evidence pointed to it being smaller than Obama's inaugural crowd sizes. Trump's official Twitter account then used a photo of Obama's inaugural crowd size and pretended it was his own.

This was priming us for gaslighting and the normalization of lies to come.

[Trump threatens Social Security’s stability](https://www.miningjournal.net/opinion/2024/10/trump-threatens-social-securitys-stability/)


Donald Trump’s tax and spending plans would add enormous amounts to the national debt, with some estimates as high as $15 trillion over a decade. But some of his tax cuts stand apart in threatening one of America’s most revered programs, Social Security. They would essentially bankrupt it by 2031.

[Imminent catastrophic public danger’: Hundreds of doctors sound new alarm about Trump](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesNews/s/3LNr3CvBZ6)


In the letter, they asserted, the 78-year old Trump “....exhibits behavior that tracks with the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual’s (DSM V) diagnostic criteria for ‘narcissistic personality disorder,’ ‘antisocial personality disorder,’ and’“paranoid personality disorder,’ all made worse by his intense sadism, which is a symptom of malignant narcissism.”

Former President Donald J. Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday opened with a standup comic who called Puerto Rico an “island of garbage” in a set that also included derogatory remarks about Latinos generally, African Americans, Palestinians and Jews.


It was a startling program for a campaign that has been trying to cut into Democrats’ support among Hispanic, Black, Jewish and Arab American voters in an effort to win in several key battleground states.
The comic, Tony Hinchcliffe, was the warm-up act ahead of several other speakers whose remarks were laced with vulgar insults, profanity and racist comments.

The crowd inside Madison Square Garden was predominantly white, with a significant number of Latinos. Many groaned at Mr. Hinchcliffe’s insult to Puerto Rico. 

Still, he told a tasteless, vulgar joke about the size of Hispanic families, mentioned watermelons as he called out a Black man in the audience and mocked Palestinians as rock-throwers and Jews as cheapskates.👀👀👀


At roughly the same time on Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris was in Philadelphia courting Pennsylvania’s sizable Puerto Rican population with a stop at a local Puerto Rican restaurant, Freddy & Tony’s.
But in New York, Mr. Trump’s rally featured a series of speakers whose remarks were far outside of longstanding political boundaries.


One, Sid Rosenberg, a conservative radio host, referred to Hillary Clinton with profanity and a sexist epithet. 

And Grant Cardone, a businessman who spoke early in the program, referred to Ms. Harris as if she were a prostitute. 

Later in the program, Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, mocked Ms. Harris’s racial identity and intelligence as he jeered the idea that she could win in November.

"Joe will go down as a lion in history.

The guy is full of integrity, he is a great politician, he is insanely accomplished, one of the few Vice Presidents who actually did something ( usually VPs are not as active due to limited power), but Biden was working ten hours every day and getting Democrats and some Republicans to support Obama ), the guy worked so hard and achieved so much, but people don`t give him the respect he deserves.

Forward to Biden’s presidency so far, he’s the most productive and effective president by accomplishments in the last 40 years at least.

Biden was able to make deals with the most obstructionist opposition in modern US history ( if not ever, apart from the era around the civil war ),

And he didn`t just make any normal deals, he created the biggest and most extensive legislation packages in all of American history.

Roosevelt the previous record holder, managed to also do an insane amount of legislation but he had the full Democratic Party behind him and absolute support in Congress and the Senate. Biden did not and still managed to pull through, and that in a single term, Roosevelt had 4.

So Biden’s accomplishment is arguably more impressive.

Edit: To all the Gaza comments:

Bibi’s been a giant pain in the ass for the Biden administration this past year, and half the reason for him coming here was to help Trump get elected.

Then there is: 

- AIPAC: It is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in America. With the Citizens United decision and increased foreign money, Israel can now have an almost direct impact on elections. Two pro-Palestinian Democratic incumbents in the U.S. House of Representatives lost in Democratic primaries because AIPAC made them the most expensive House primaries in history. This obviously sends a loud and clear message to other politicians.
	
- While Michigan has a large pro-Palestinian Muslim population, Pennsylvania—the biggest battleground state—has a sizable number of pro-Israeli Jewish Americans. Balancing between these two groups is crucial.
	
- Harris is going to base every single move from now until the election on very specific internal state-level polling and will be careful not to get ahead of it or try to shift where the electorate stands less than a month before the election.

- If Biden and Harris come out too strong against Netanyahu, they risk being labeled as anti-Semitic by the powerful right-wing media, AIPAC, and Russian disinformation campaigns. At the same time, if Biden cuts off aid to Israel, it wouldn’t be surprising if Netanyahu either stages a false flag operation or conveniently ignores intelligence of another terrorist attack just to say, “Look what Democrats did to us, making us defenseless”—a move that could guarantee a loss. After all, this is consistent with how Netanyahu thinks: the ends justify the means.

So, the best the Biden administration and Harris campaign can do is publicly toe the line while subtly signaling and “leaking” their extreme dissatisfaction with Netanyahu. Post-election, I’d bet that policy will change significantly.",2024_10_31

He will 100% turn LGBQT+ into illegal and likely overturn gay marriage and allow states to outlaw being gay. I have no doubt in my mind this is where they will go with that stuff. It blows my mind how many gay folks still will vote for a man that hates/despises them and ha every intention of making their lives miserable.

But he will do whatever he can to ensure the maga candidates win every 4 years until they can get rid of voting. Lot of people say it cant be done. Well I'm here to tell you.. a LOT of shit Trump did and got away with was NEVER able to be done before. Until he did it.

That covers the domestic side nicely but don’t forget what he accomplished internationally. First off he quickly repaired the damage Trump did to our relationships with our allies and restored our reputation as a partner that can be relied on to honor our commitments. He put us back into the Paris climate agreement. He made the US the cornerstone of the multinational group supporting Ukraine and managed the resistance to Russia in a way that isolated Putin but also didn’t allow the conflict to spin out of control. He made the hard decision to remove all of our troops from Afghanistan and end our occupation once and for all. Finally he was able to turn the US economy and lead all nations in the recovery from the global recession without conflicts with our trading partners.

"Yes, exactly! When I originally took out my loans I signed up for a 2.5% interest rate. During my last semester of college I was pregnant with my son, so I was about to have a newborn and no job prospects as a new graduate. That's when the loan processor talked me into a consolidation that raised my interest rate to 5%. It felt wrong that in order to 'save' money my interest rate needed to be doubled, but I was young, didn't fully understand how it all worked, and the processor was calling me non stop and badgering me into doing the consolidation. He even threatened jail time at one point, which scared me really badly because I didn't know that you can't be jailed for debts. I finally gave up and signed the paperwork 2 days before my son was born. 

I worked minium wage 'entry level' jobs and was barely able to scrape together enough for childcare, so I deferred my loans for the first 4 years because I had literally no other choice. When my son started kindergarten I was finally able to put that money back toward the loans, but only at the minimum monthly payments for a while. The interest just kept growing out of control. I'm still furious about how scammy it was, but he was the official person contracted to process federal loans, so I gave in. Turned out that my gut instincts were correct and it was a really shady thing that they were getting away with during W's administration.

Biden's forgiveness not only wiped out all of that excessive interest, but I also got a refund of the little bit that I had overpaid. I wouldn't have been upset if I had to pay back the 2.5% interest as well, since I knew that going into the borrowing process, but honestly, student loans shouldn't have any interest at all because it should be viewed as an investment in the future tax paying workforce. And I'm going to be absolutely celebrating in the streets the day they make higher education free, even though I had to pay, because making things better and easier for the next generation *should* be the goal, right?",2024_10_31

Republicans know the vote bank is with supporting Trump so though they know the problem with indecency,  violence etc they will support Trump to keep his voter base supporting their own bids. Without any policy, their only job has been to criticize every Democrat led bills.
How MTG and Boebart get elected is beyond me and will need AI to decode it for me in future

"All of the deliberately deceptive, misleading, and borderline to blatantly illegal things Musk and his PACs are doing in the swing states this year just can't be allowed to stand unanswered.  

He's decided he wants Trump to be President and he doesn't care about being truthful, following the law, or acting with any basic level of decency.

But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”",2024_10_31

Right now, they're throwing tantrums across the internet about Biden's comments because all they care about are half-truths and gotcha moments. Every single bit of it is dishonest and hypocritical.

They have decided to make actual patriots and defenders of democracy their mortal enemies, while supporting a presidential nominee who has more admiration for foreign dictators than our constitution.

Trumpers are the epitome of unserious people, but they're also very dangerous. They always will be. This will not end with the election, either way. They will never be governable by anyone but Trump, and eventually Trump will turn on them too. When this happens, we all know they'll STILL be blaming democrats and Hillary Clinton.

There is no silver lining or inevitable moment of clarity with these people. No scene from a movie where the crowd drops their Tump flags on the ground and walk away because they've finally had enough. No epiphanies. No acquiescence. No misunderstandings. Trumpers only one want thing, and that's to win, win, win, and beat the democrats. They would rather die as the result of Trump's buffoonery than admit they were wrong, and many of them have.

So, let's stop pretending they can be brought back to reality. They're in too deep and always were. They've had a decade to course correct, and they have only doubled down during this time. At some point, you just gotta face facts and call them what they are. Garbage.

The only people still clinging to this notion that Trumpers can be saved are the same people in zombie movies who get eaten by their spouses because they think there's still a person somewhere inside. There's not. It's time to start seeing them the same way they see the rest of us. Otherwise, we're zombie food.",2024_10_31

Mike Pence may have catered to Trump while it was politically convenient, but when it came to choosing between Trump and the Constitution, Pence made the right call.

I remember discussing policy with people who, when nothing was left to say, just told me to get over it, to stop whining, to accept they’ve won as if politics is some sort of deranged team game. It’s fucking not. We all have witness the worst response imaginable for covid for example and luckily people like Fauci had been there to do as much as he did. And that’s just on thing of the insane policy we had to suffer through. The deplorable comment was justified and is ringing true more and more.",2024_10_31

"By Khaleda Rahman - National Correspondent: 

A disparaging comment about Puerto Rico was made at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally has incensed residents of the island territory—and experts say it's not clear how it may impact an upcoming non-binding referendum where Puerto Ricans can vote for statehood or independence.

Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe joked that Puerto Rico was ""a floating island of garbage"" during a rally on Sunday that featured crude and racist remarks from several speakers. The comment drew condemnation from both sides of the aisle, including from some of Trump's top Republican allies. The campaign has distanced itself from the joke about Puerto Rico, but not the other remarks.

>\[Delegate\] González-Colón and three pro-statehood witnesses [doubled down on their opposition to the self-determination bill ](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/statehood-or-self-determination-tensions-over-puerto-rico-status-rise-n1264184)advocated by Ocasio-Cortez and Velázquez because they believe it will unnecessarily stretch a debate Puerto Ricans on the island have been having for nearly seven decades and open a pathway to debate territorial options that may not be consistent with U.S. constitutional law.

Here's what I mean by her not trusting the residents of PR to know what they want:

>Ocasio-Cortez and former Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, one of the three witnesses who testified in favor of the self-determination bill, argued that the debate over Puerto Rico’s territorial status has been “one-sided” and marred with political interests that have historically deprived Puerto Ricans from meaningfully exploring independence and free association as options.

[Here ](https://www.axios.com/2021/03/05/puerto-rico-statehood-aoc)AOC shows her lack of understanding of the process to become a state. There is a process and the residents of the territory have a say during the entire process.

I was merely pointing out that the results of the vote I believe the other commenter was using as example of overwhelming support for statehood was also a vote that I thought had been protested against… it could be wrong there too, this was my memory from looking into it a while ago. So… maybe not exactly the best election to use to say, “yeah people in PR definitely want it, look at this vote.”",2024_10_31

> Donald Trump took his frequent habit of describing himself as a &quot;Protector&quot; of women further on Wednesday night in Wisconsin, when he declared he would protect them &quot;Whether the women like it or not&quot; if he wins a second term in the White House.

> The Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt responded: &quot;Harris may be the first woman Vice President but she has implemented dangerously liberal policies that have left women worse off financially and far less safe than we were four years ago under President Trump.""

> Harris has made reproductive rights central to her campaign after Trump appointed three conservative justices to the supreme court, who promptly overturned the right to abortion, a fact Trump often takes credit for.

Property, income & sales tax, all eliminated.” She noted that, according to state rules, there is “No stipulation regarding a minimum # of human remains necessary for the tax breaks to kick in--looks like one corpse will suffice to make at least 3 forms of tax vanish.”",2024_10_31

"With the additional context that last year Trump was determined by a jury and court to be a rapist, this tape is especially abhorrent on a relisten.

The sixteen year old had literally heard of none of it.  I called my grandmother to discuss it, and she had not heard of it either.  When I brought up Trump being adjudicated to have raped E Jean Carrol, she said I must be thinking of some other politician.

"This is great that these young people are hearing this and paying attention. One of the biggest issues with Trump's popularity, in my opinion, is the ""news"" that the right tends to watch trump-washes all of the news, so they NEVER hear any of the negative things about him only how great he is. Mainstream media has also been way, way too nice to him for the past 9 years. If all the mainstream news had been calling him out daily for his crimes, his insane ranting at rallies, his total disdain for women, people of any color other than white, and the poor we might not be in this situation now where he could potentially be elected yet again. The PRESS is the main issue in this country, right after the maga people who refuse to even attempt to learn how this man actually is. I'm a boomer who has been a registered republican his entire life, although I have always voted for the person I thought would do the best job, that included Obama, Hillary and Biden.

She asked the teens how they felt about the Chris Brown and Rihanna situation and none of them even knew about it. It blew my mind that they know who both of them are but had no idea Chris beat the shit out of her.

"Remember how he bragged on Stern about regularly going back stage at beauty pageants while minors were undressing? How many of them did he ""grab by the pussy"" and then pay off.",2024_10_31
"Over/under 1, the amount of times Trump has said 'smell my finger'",2024_10_31
a literal modus operandi,2024_10_31
Ron Jeremy was notorious for doing this to women as well.,2024_10_31
And don’t forget this fits the description of the E Jean Carrol sexual assault to a “T”. _(You know the one he had to pay almost $100 million over?)_ It’s clearly his real MO and wasn’t just “locker room talk”.,2024_10_31

"I remember being in complete shock and disgust on election night. My conservative father was childcare for my infant son at the time, and I was near tears dropping him off before work the next morning. My dad asked what was wrong, and I lost it that someone could be caught being this disgusting and still end up president. He tried to use the “locker room talk” excuse, and I looked him straight in the eye and said, “Is it just locker room talk when it’s your daughter? Because I had a complete stranger sneak up behind me and grope me in the middle of the day at a gas station while [my husband] was in the bathroom. It was terrifying, and I’m still scared when I’m alone at gas stations all these years later.” The dumbfounded look on his face… apparently, he had never thought that HIS daughter could be an assault victim.

I am happy to say that I am hopeful he’s not voting for Trump this time around. I don’t know for sure, obviously, but he made an unprompted comment during primaries that all he needed to know about the candidates was which ones were Trump supporters so he wouldn’t vote for them. I am hopeful there are plenty of other lifelong conservatives out there who are quietly disgusted by Trump and willing to vote country over party.",2024_10_31
"Seriously. It's bad enough even if he were just a loser who stayed at home and had a trivial role in society. We should expect a lot more out of the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. This should be a person we look up to and respect, who conducts themselves with class and dignity. 

Also... Was it ""locker room talk"" to flirt with 14-year-olds?:



> After watching a youth choir sing carols, Trump asked two of the girls how old they were. When they said they were 14, Trump, who again was 46 at the time, said, “Wow! Just think — in a couple of years, I'll be dating you.”

...


Or when he said the same fucking thing about an even younger girl

> In the 1992 recording, a 46-year-old Trump asks a little girl if she’s going to go up an escalator. Then Trump turns to the camera and says, “I am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?

....

More ""goodies"":

> I’ve known Jeff [Epstein] for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.

...

> Mr. Trump frequently sought assurances — at times from strangers — that the women in his life were beautiful. During the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant, he sat in the audience as his teenage daughter, Ivanka, helped to host the event from onstage. He turned to Brook Antoinette Mahealani Lee, Miss Universe at the time, and asked for her opinion of his daughter’s body.

> “‘Don’t you think my daughter’s hot? She’s hot, right?’” Ms. Lee recalled him saying. ‘I was like, ‘Really?’ That’s just weird. She was 16. That’s creepy.”

...

Speaking about his 1-year-old daughter Tiffany's breasts:

> When Trump was asked whether Tiffany looked more like him or Trump’s then-wife Marla Maples, he said Marla, and added that Tiffany was “a really beautiful baby.” But the first specific feature Trump mentioned wasn’t anything in her face — it was her legs.

> “She’s got Marla’s legs. We don’t know whether or not she’s got this part yet,” Trump said, miming a pair of breasts over his own chest, “but time will tell.”

...

Or when he had to clarify he wasn't ""interested"" in Paris Hilton... *when she was 12*:

> Now, somebody who a lot of people don’t give credit to but is in actuality very beautiful is Paris Hilton. I’ve known Paris Hilton from the time she’s 12, her parents are friends of mine, and the first time I saw her she walked into the room and I said, ‘Who the hell is that?’ At 12, I wasn’t interested … but she was beautiful.

It helped him out that Russia released a bunch of hacked DNC documents that same day to deflect as much media attention away from the tape as possible.,2024_10_31
"100% the media is completely culpable for this farce, from Fox News to NPR. The fact he is still in the political landscape at all, much less has a chance of winning next week, is proof in and of itself. If the oligarchs wanted him gone then he would be gone. All it takes is letting out a whoop! on stage or spelling potato wrong. He exists because they need him to exist.",2024_10_31

"It wasn't exactly a one-off, either, or only aimed at Democrats. When Republican FauxNews lady (can't call what she does journalism) Megyn Kelly brought up some of his anti-women comments at a debate, he said she was ""bleeding from her... wherever."" Definitely a visceral moment.",2024_10_31
I remember thinking that was it for him. But he knew the Republican base better than all of us. He understood that the only risk to his campaign was apologising - showing weakness or contrition.,2024_10_31

"It’s because America was already familiar and conditioned when it came to Trump. So when the tapes hit, it wasn’t surprising or shocking. It was completely in line with who we thought. 

If it happened to a random lifetime politician, it would have been a campaign killer. If you’re not familiar with someone and you hear that, you’d dump him easy as a candidate because that would be one of the only things you knew about him. But Trump got to play by different rules thanks to his built in persona.",2024_10_31
"It should have been a campaign killer except one major problem- his opponents husband was Bill Clinton. After this tape came out Steve Bannon trotted out some of Bill’s former victims and call out their hypocrisy. I hate Trump and Bannon and Bill too for that matter and I’m no trumper but this is what happened and one of many reasons why Clinton was so uniquely vulnerable to lose to him.

They looked like little kids, because they were, but this year one's voting in his first Presidential election and the other will be eligible by the 2026 midterms.

Biden can’t just order the Fed, Congress, SCOTUS, or state governments, however he chooses.

Reminder that Donald Trump was found to be a sexual abuser by a jury of his peers in May 2023.

...

> Mr. Trump frequently sought assurances — at times from strangers — that the women in his life were beautiful. During the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant, he sat in the audience as his teenage daughter, Ivanka, helped to host the event from onstage. He turned to Brook Antoinette Mahealani Lee, Miss Universe at the time, and asked for her opinion of his daughter’s body.

> “‘Don’t you think my daughter’s hot? She’s hot, right?’” Ms. Lee recalled him saying. ‘I was like, ‘Really?’ That’s just weird. She was 16. That’s creepy.”

...

Speaking about his 1-year-old daughter Tiffany's breasts:

> When Trump was asked whether Tiffany looked more like him or Trump’s then-wife Marla Maples, he said Marla, and added that Tiffany was “a really beautiful baby.” But the first specific feature Trump mentioned wasn’t anything in her face — it was her legs.

> “She’s got Marla’s legs. We don’t know whether or not she’s got this part yet,” Trump said, miming a pair of breasts over his own chest, “but time will tell.”

...

Or when he had to clarify he wasn't ""interested"" in Paris Hilton... *when she was 12*:

> Now, somebody who a lot of people don’t give credit to but is in actuality very beautiful is Paris Hilton. I’ve known Paris Hilton from the time she’s 12, her parents are friends of mine, and the first time I saw her she walked into the room and I said, ‘Who the hell is that?’ At 12, I wasn’t interested … but she was beautiful.

...

Or when he was 46 years old and literally flirted with 14-year-olds:

> After watching a youth choir sing carols, Trump asked two of the girls how old they were. When they said they were 14, Trump, who again was 46 at the time, said, “Wow! Just think — in a couple of years, I'll be dating you.”

...

Or when he said the same fucking thing about an even younger girl

> In the 1992 recording, a 46-year-old Trump asks a little girl if she’s going to go up an escalator. Then Trump turns to the camera and says, “I am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?

"They do care. But not in the way you think. 

People who are racist, or misogynist, or whatever else attracts them to support someone like Trump - they have the maturity and emotional intelligence of children. You ever see that phase in young children, where if they're caught doing something bad, they'll lie about it, even if it's incredibly obvious? They do it because they want to avoid getting into trouble and facing consequences, sure, but a big part of it is because they're learning about core concepts in society, and how they function on a basic binary. There's good, and there's bad. Good people do good things, bad people do bad things. Everyone, fundamentally, believes that they're the good guy. So when a child, who believes they're a good person, is caught doing something objectively *bad*, they can't rationalize it. If they're doing something *bad*...oh no, that would make them a bad person...but they're not a bad person! Nope! I didn't do it! I couldn't have done it! I'm a good person! 

People who support Trump and then hear something so fundamentally evil and socially maladaptive simply can't reconcile with that reality. Whether it's the hollywood access tapes, or any of the millions of insane lies and ramblings he's spewed over his entire lifetime, if they admit that what they heard from Trump was unacceptable, then they have to grapple with their black-and-white perspective of good and evil. A normal person who is capable of thinking critically and humbling themselves will recognize that they were deceived, and lied to, and sure, that feels awful, but they CAN do better. They can deal with the pain and accept their failure, and grow from it into someone else. People who still support Trump physically CAN'T do it, because they approach it like a child. ""Trump did this bad thing. But...if he did this bad thing, that means he's a bad person...And, if I'm supporting a bad person, that makes ME a bad person...but I'm not bad! I'm good! I'm a good person, so he HAS to be a good person! I don't care if he did this, and I don't care what else he does! He talks like me and supports people like me, so he HAS to be on my side!"" 

Poor, poor bastards don't even realize that the Nazis also thought they were the heroes. The villains in the saturday morning cartoons think they're in the right, and Satan rebelled against God because he believed he was entitled to be the greatest creation of God, not humanity. It *always* starts with believing you're a good person, rather than recognizing that people are *always* shades of grey, with zero moral purity to be found anywhere in the world.

He is a rich ultra-right wing libertarian that most likely would orgasm
if ending up with a society as described in the [Libertarian Police
Department](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/l-p-d-libertarian-police-department)
story.

He has also in true libertarian spirit attempted to fund development of
some free floating offshore project called Seasteading that should be some libertarian utopia
without any kind of governance with building or safety regulations or any such pesky ""freedom
stealing"" things that a normal society needs to function.

The podcast [Behind the bastards](https://www.behindthebastards.com/) had two episodes about it:

* [Part One: The Not-At-All-Sad History of Libertarian Sea Nations](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/episode/part-one-the-not-at-all-sad-history-of-89890804/)

This project is possibly the least harmful thing Peter has done, since it has
has drained him for a lot of money that he cannot use for other evil things,
and the people scammed are other libertarian fools.

But do not think that libertarians are not able to harm! I guess the closest thing
to a successful attempt to creating a libertarian utopia is when a bunch of libertarians
decided to move and try to take over some smaller town Grafton in New Hampshire
as a [""Free Town Project""](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21534416/free-state-project-new-hampshire-libertarians-matthew-hongoltz-hetling)
(later changed to ""Free State Project""), and ruined it with their reckless governance.

Like for instance getting rid of public garbage collection.
And with no mandatory garbage collection, of course they got problems
with wild bears walking around peoples' houses (in addition to some idiots deliberately
feeding wild bears, but hey in a libertarian society nobody should be
able to force people to stop doing what they want...).

There is a book about it with title [""A Libertarian Walks Into a Bear""](https://www.allbookstores.com/search?type=advance&author=&title=A+Libertarian+Walks+Into+a+Bear&isbn=&binding=&dateyear_operator=during&dateyear=).

So the jury found sexual abuse because they weren’t sure it was his penis that penetrated her without consent. 

The judge in the case clarified that it’s not defamation to say he’s liable for rape because the lay definition, and most state law definitions, includes forced digital penetration in the definition of rape. That state just has a particularly narrow statute.

>media bias chart

That chart is not a Harvard project but created by a ""for-profit business with a stated public mission"", word for word from their site.  If you look at the chart itself it very the ""reputable sources"" noticeably shifts to the left.

If you look at the actual methodology of this it's very simplistic with 3 people, self described left, center, and right, rating each article for its bias.  It's quite literally the American media Overton window on purpose and not relevant to what I wrote at all.

I also remember when a few years ago that chart had Jacobinmag to the right of MSNBC which is pretty lol-worthy.  It's not like that now but it kinda zapped the credibility of it away for me.

A huge amount of the bias of orgs like CNN is how they don't report on things.   Not that big of a chomsky fan, but Manfacturing consent is a fantastic read about this and how no one in the USA knew anything about the situation with indonesia in East timor back in the 70s because the media refused to report on it.  None of this would be shown in this chart.

>Both sides love demonizing each other. Once again, you guys have a lot more in common than you think


""Both sides"" demonize each other but I'm objectively correct lol. The highly educated skews left wing and the non-educated skew hard right.   This is an extremely well known fact and facts don't care about your feelings or ""sides"".

""Both sides"" in the debate about the flat earth demonize each other constantly too.   That doesn't mean ""both sides"" are valid. 

I also demonize tankies all the time.

Theres a lot more than ""Both sides"" out there",2024_10_31
">but created by a ""for-profit business with a stated public mission"", word for word from their site. If you look at the chart itself it very the ""reputable sources"" noticeably shifts to the left.

No shit, bruh. It's their job to evaluate media bias and sell that information to marketers for money. That's what the organization does. Does a profit motive invalidate their work? Nope. I seriously hope you're not the type of person who sees a pipe burst in the kitchen, but refuses to call the plumber because the plumber is a ""for-profit business"", so his work can't be trusted.

And did you actually read up on their methodology or did you just seize upon the first sentence to try and portray them as bumbling goons in an effort to save your argument?  Keep in mind that they have taken tens of millions from angel investors for a reason.

>Each article or show is rated by at least three analysts – one left-leaning, one right-leaning and one center, politically. All of our media analysts complete a training period that includes a thorough introduction to our methodology, as well as practice rating articles and other news content. We purposefully assign each analyst a breadth of coverage over as many sources as possible to enhance each analyst’s familiarity with sources across the spectrum.

>Analysts generally score articles similarly following our analysis training, regardless of their political lean; however, when significant differences occur, the group engages in a conversation during which analysts present their rationale for their respective scores.

>We do not rate the merits of political positions. Rather, we place the content where it descriptively belongs relative to the current range of political thought within the United States. When scoring for reliability, our method focuses on classifying content along a continuum including fact, analysis, opinion, incomplete story, propaganda, and fabricated information.

>All of the above minimizes the impact of analyst bias on reliability and source bias scoring. It results in a rating of sources that many individuals, instructors, and other stakeholders find helpful in navigating today’s news ecosystem.

Lastly, I didn't ask you to justify your demonization to me. Just acknowledge that that is what you're doing.",2024_10_31

I usually fix shit like that myself because basic maintenance is easy, youtube is a phenomenal teacher, and I enjoy it.  But no, there's no one in the entire western world who would thinks every plumber can't be trusted because it's a for profit business.  But the opposite, trusting literally every plumber and auto mechanic out there is pretty darn naive, don't you think?  

What I'm doing is actually analyzing your source.   I went to the site to actually read their methodology speficially because I remembered it  *had jacobin to the right of msnbc* a few years ago, which is patently absurd.  I will give them credit that that's no longer the case, but still.  That's rediculous.


I then wrote out a simplification of exactly what their method is and then pointed out some very specific, obvious flaws that would be biases that wouldn't be picked up by their system.  The org wouldn't put that in their own self marketing materials for very obvious reasons!  



>We do not rate the merits of political positions. Rather, we place the content where it descriptively belongs relative to the current range of political thought within the United States.

This is also pretty much exactly what I wrote about the Overton window in the usa.  I originally wrote how right leaning CNN vs the rest of developed world - again, on everything that isn't LGBT.  


>Keep in mind that they have taken tens of millions from angel investors for reason

He just told you that he would do what he thinks is right for you, regardless whether you like it or not. That means literally, if he decides women would be happier wearing poodle skirts and being stay at home mothers of five he’s going to do everything in his considerable power as leader of one of the most powerful nations on earth to MAKE you live that life. And if you have career aspirations, or don’t want to be a parent, or don’t fit that mold in any way, it doesn’t matter. Because he thinks you’ll be happier this way 

He just told you, women of America, DIRECTLY, that your opinion does not matter. And that you can’t be trusted to form your own opinions, because you don’t know what’s best for you. He does. 

It doesn’t matter at this point if you don’t like Kamala. Your choices are someone you don’t like, or someone that has proudly proclaimed he’s going to take away your freedom. Please. Don’t let him. You have the power to stop it.",2024_10_31

“I was confused, to be honest. I was born and raised in Woodbridge, Virginia, so, you’ve got everything about me and now you’re saying that I’m an alien. Why would you let me vote before and not now?” she asked in an interview with News4.

Martin is one of 1,600 Virginians whose voter registration was canceled after Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued an executive order on Aug. 7 ordering election officials to speed up the process of purging noncitizens form voter rolls.

In many cases, the voters were removed because they checked a box or missed checking a box on a DMV form designating them as a noncitizen.

The Department of Justice and groups representing immigrant communities filed suit and said the purge violated a federal law that bars voter registration cancelations so close to an election.

“So many stories have come out. These are U.S. citizens. They are being prohibited their right to vote,” said Monica Sarmiento, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights.""",2024_10_31

It does make sense for them to be removed and that's why the law allowing purges exists.

"Video from the Advocate: [https://www.advocate.com/news/gay-harris-volunteers-attacked](https://www.advocate.com/news/gay-harris-volunteers-attacked)

>An angry tattooed bearded white man began screaming at the Bello and Coniaris while driving by. Bello started recording as the man stepped out of his vehicle, wearing a dark-colored cap, t-shirt, and jogging pants. The man accused the two canvassers of placing Harris campaign signs “all over public property.” The canvassers explained that they weren’t doing that.

>“F\*\*king c\*\*ksucking f\*\*\*ots!” the man yelled. “Get your little f\*\*king f\*\* a\*\*es out of this town. We don’t need you in this f\*\*king town. You little f\*\*king pieces of sh\*\*. Go suck each other’s c\*\*ks somewhere else, you f\*\*king f\*\*\[s\], before I f\*\*king put a gun in you pieces of s\*\*t. I will be back and rip every one of your f\*\*ing signs out of your…”

>The man then re-entered his vehicle and sped off while continuing to yell obscenities. Bello told Coniaris to step off of the road as the man’s vehicle sped away.

> “It was obviously terrifying at the time,” Bello told the aforementioned publication. “Our goal was just to de-escalate and try and get him to leave as fast as possible.”

>“It made me think of how one-sided the hatred is,” he continued. “A Trump supporter might feel uncomfortable in a highly Democratic area, but I don’t feel like a lot of Trump supporters would feel physically unsafe and threatened in the way that this guy made us feel.”

>Bello added that he hopes his experience will encourage other LGBTQ+ voters to help Harris win the election.

> “As intense as it was, this is what generations of queer people before us have endured, and it’s our turn to be there and face the hatred. The hate is real,” he told Advocate.com. “Don’t let it scare you. The only way we can fight this hate is to not back down.”

"No, it was designed to avoid a standing army.

During the constitutional convention, the founders *really* didn't want to have an army of enlisted soldiers, and got the 2nd amendment passed to formalize a ""common defense"" (against hostile foreign sources), composed of a heavily armed militia.

They saw how well that worked, literally within the year.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Clair's_defeat

It failed so hard, we got a standing army out of it. Passed by the same congress that passed by the 2nd amendment, and who were opposed to the idea of a standing army.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_the_United_States

The idea of using a militia for defense lasted less than a year. 

It was never intended to defend against a tyrannical federal government. That's revisionist history, mostly because that same congress engaged in the most followed tradition in politics. They said ""we'll deal with the problem later"" and kicked the can of reverting the 2nd amendment (which lost it's core purpose with the establishment of a permanent Standing Army) down the road to deal with later (and they never dealt with it).

It would be embarrassing to revert one of your big amendments you passed less than a year before. So they didn't.

It was only through a very ""Originalist"" viewing of history, and you stop reading the second the amendment was passed, that you get a heavily armed militia was what was intended.

Interestingly, for that Originalist logic to hold true, you also need to effectively disband the entire US Military (at least the enlisted personnel side of things). You don't see them doing that, do you?",2024_10_31

> He states that he “never in his life” thought that a month later, “a comedian would appear to criticize and talk badly about my [Puerto Rico],” he said. “That’s why I’m renouncing my support for Donald Trump and stepping away from any political conversation.

"TBH... respect. It takes courage and strength to admit you were wrong, especially when denouncing someone as vitriolic as Trump.

I have no idea why I'm being downvoted. What would be good enough? Public self-flagellation? Giving away everything he has? Ending his own life? 

He admitted he was wrong and made a statement. We should be welcoming when cult members find the guts to exit. That's the  ***only*** way we can fix this toxic social milieu in a manner fitting of a civilized people.

There's a really fucking good reason why experts (sociologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, political scientists, religious studies experts etc etc) on cults and exit strategies absolutely loathe the phrase ""deprogramming"". Much like getting through an addiction, the only way someone can truly leave a cult is when they choose to do so themselves. And language like ""deprogramming"" takes away their agency before they could even find it to begin with. 

When someone exits a cult and all they hear is ""haha leopards ate your face, you totally deserve it"", they have two options: 1) go towards people reveling in their suffering or 2) go back to the cult. I know this means ZERO to anyone reading, but from 2020-when Elon took over, I was part of a group on Twitter who helped people exit the QAnon cult. Denigrating people when they admit they're wrong, even if it's to save their reputation publicly, doesn't help. It's still a step, no matter how much of a baby step it is.

Seriously, this is way bigger than Nicky Jam; if Harris wins, we have some serious work to do and that involves having empathy for those who exit the MAGA cult and not laughing in their face.",2024_10_31

We can and should still question the people who change on why they changed, and help them self reflect.

You don’t get a free pass all because you no longer support Trump. And if you can’t handle the heat and the ask of self reflection, did you really change your mind for the right reasons?",2024_10_31

Until then, AC had thrived on being close to major east coast cities, compared to Vegas…because there was nowhere else. Foxwoods, Mohegan Sun, and others changed that drastically.

"Thanks for reading. The Opinion columnist Jamelle Bouie argues that Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden was a sign of weakness:

""I’m sure that to some observers, all of this — even the terrible racist jokes — looks like the confidence and resolve of a determined political movement,"" writes Jamelle. ""But I think it’s just the opposite. Far from showing strength, the Madison Square Garden rally showed that however vicious and virulent its leaders and supporters might be, the MAGA movement is a spent and exhausted force, even if it is not yet defeated,"" he adds.

""Watching a lackluster rally headlined by the rambling patter of a tired candidate struggling to capture the attention of his audience, it is clear that neither he nor his movement has the juice. I know what failure looks like. At Madison Square Garden, I saw it on display.""

Are they going to give them armbands, load them on trains, transport them to camps?",2024_10_31

Mar-a-Lago and Trump’s golf courses employed undocumented workers for years.,2024_10_31
Scummy lads wouldn't do mass deportation fairly. It'd be targeted at liberal communities.,2024_10_31
"It's time to engage in a thought experiment. Lets simply envision what mass deportations will look like in Authoritarian America using the model of how this has happened throughout history.

On January 21st, 2025, following Trumps coronation as the 47th US President, he signs into law an executive order granting him emergency powers to overcome the dangerous illegal migrant population in the U.S. Using that and other already existing laws, Trump commands the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) to deputize all local police forces nationwide as immigration officers. The people cheer, because they've been told for years now how unsafe the country is now thanks to these people.

Unfortunately for them, Illegal immigrants are hard to find. They do not regularly interact with our government and it's not like they all wear matching t-shirts. So what do you do? You go house to house. You check. 

Now they probably won't enter your home at that time (if the 4th amendment still exists) so maybe people will be able to hide at their legal friends houses. To combat this, the government sets up a tip line encouraging all patriots to report these activities and those they suspect as being illegal migrants to the police. Now the government has the authority to enter the home of those harboring fugitives, and take those that hid them into custody as well. 

You might be saying, ""that will get so many people!"" And your right, it is. It'll overload the system. So while they await trial, the illegal immigrants are imprisoned. Don't worry though, if the prisons fill up too quick, I'm sure one of our billionaire patriots (in exchange for a lucrative government contract) will gladly fund the construction of new ""open air prisons"" at the border to house the migrants indefinitely until they can be processed. 

Half the country is in an uproar (as they should be) and begin marching in protest to the government actions. President Trump, untethered by anyone who can tell him no, follows through with his threats from the summer of 2020 and allows police to begin shoot protesters. The riots stop, and the mistreatment of migrants continues.

The time is now October 2025 and you realize the America you remember is gone. You can't speak out against it. What do you do now?

Suddenly, there is a knock at the door. A report has been made about you by one of your neighbors. You do have non white heritage after all, its not like they can tell just by looking at you if you are ""American"" or not. (better safe than sorry right?)

So you pull out your ID, you're birth certificate, and any other proof you have that you are and have always been an American. Unfortunately, the Trump administration had recently outlawed birthright citizenship, and your mother had been born in America after her mother fled somewhere else. She wasn't a legal citizen at the time. You citizenship in this country is now denied. They march you to a waiting vehicle and your new life begins. 

Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it'll all go great. 

Maybe not.",2024_10_31

> As many as one in 20 Floridians, a million people, could be expelled from the country under a mass deportation plan that is a cornerstone of former president Donald Trump&#039;s campaign, according to a report released by a Washington think tank and immigration advocacy group.

> The American Immigration Council, based in Washington D.C., put numbers to Trump&#039;s sweeping plan to deport 13.3 million undocumented or otherwise removable immigrants in the United States should he return to the White House.

> While undocumented immigrants cannot tap into federal social-safety net programs such as Social Security and Medicare, those programs would lose out on tens of billions of dollars in tax contributions should undocumented immigrants be deported.

He knows he can just change the narrative after winning (just like he did in 2017 when the economy magically was great even though he hadn't done much). He can deport more than usual, maybe have more draconian border policies and claim victory. Afterall, immigration has plummeted already the last few months - he will just take credit for it like he would with inflation since it is down to 2019 levels. Any road blocks and he can throw up his hands and blame everyone. Likely he will say it's great and then 2 years later say it is bad again just like the dreaded caravans. 

The bigger issue are the true believers he is surrounding himself and are the real policy and decision makers. They actually do want to get rid of them and many think it will be easier than it is. They will push to deport, then quickly move to camps because you physically cannot deport so many people since it requires the other countries to accept them back and would cost an insane amount of money.

If we had computer systems that could ticket drivers every time they broke any driving law, we'd all get dozens of tickets, lose our licenses and then no one could get to work.

We struggle to fill stadiums with 50,000 people without hours of traffic and trump thinks he's going to be so competent at his goals that 20 football stadiums full of people are going to leave just one single state? 

Anyone who thinks Trump will accomplish this goal 100% are just as delusional as the people supporting it. It's not possible under perfect conditions. He's still going to try and that's bad. Apparently talking about how bad Trump is going to be isn't popular on Reddit anymore? Lol

Edit - I just want to be clear how comically terrible and bad of a plan this is that isn't possible to work. He's obviously just throwing out words he thinks sound cruel because even if he was competent, and he is not, this wouldn't really be possible at anywhere near the levels he's seems to be claiming.

4 years is 1044 working days. You would need almost 960 deportations every single working day, including holidays so closer to 1000 per day taking people on a bus on a plane on a boat for 4 straight years. Bruh Trump would be lucky to get to 100 a day 2 years into his term. The kind of police force required to do this isn't materializing in 6 months and still wouldn't be good enough 2 years in. Remember also he would get bogged down in the courts. One celebrity activist placed in the right place at the right time could easily slow the whole system down and at the point of snatching up 1000 humans every single day they will make that mistake there's no way to manage that accurately without so much more infrastructure. This is just one state. He wants 50 operations of a similar size? 50,000 people every single day being removed from America? An entire stadium filled to capacity every single day for 4 years will be successfully removed from the country during a trump term? No. He will pass more tax cuts for his friends and chicken out. But even if he tries to do this, it's an impossible political promise. Trump is a liar. Trump is an idiot. A cruel, racist, idiot, just like his supporters. Who are just as stupid for thinking a plan like this could work in any context for which it's proposed. Their legislative plan is hate. Their goals are unobtainable. They have lost the plot.

"Even if politicians aren’t going to be able to accomplish the things that campaign on, I think it’s important to vote like they can. For decades people were saying “Everyone knows they aren’t going to be able to overturn Roe v. Wade”. 

I fully expect Trump to at least try to execute a mass deportation operation. It will likely be a shit show and a lot of American citizens and legal residents will get swept up. Trump has already been asked about that in an interview and doesn’t think that accidentally deporting people is that big a deal.  

He’s also talked about revoking legal status for groups of immigrants in the country so that he can deport them. 

When given the opportunity to ramp up the staffing of immigration courts so that they could process cases more expediently to get through backlogged cases and begin removals, Trump had his allies in Congress block it. I don’t trust that any mass deportation effort his administration undertakes will be overly concerned with following due process.

"> Is there like a time and a place?

USA,  1942-1946. 

> Those people came back

A relatively small % were shipped to Japan after the war, and those did not come back. But generally they were interned in camps in the US, so there was no “coming back” beyond them finding a place to go. 

Over 50,000 legal immigrants and over 70,000 native-born citizens (native-born because Japanese immigrants could not become citizens until 1952) were released from internment with no homes to go back to. So they didn’t so much “come back” as they found somewhere to go (often back to same region as before, yes). 

> Who here thinks Trump is going to do this in a way where anyone comes back?

That sounds…ominous.",2024_10_31

If I am correct the Dems have a shot.  

I believe people still underestimate how angry women are about Roe being overturned, and I believe that while increased turnout will be from both sides it will favor Dems, and there is a small but significant number of republicans who are disgusted by trump and/or Cruz and will vote against them regardless of party affiliation.....",2024_10_31

That's defined as ""A person acts with criminal negligence, or is criminally negligent, with respect to the result of their conduct when they ought to be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that an ordinary person would exercise under all the circumstances as viewed from the actor’s standpoint.""

"Yes, but it requires 2 things for those charges to stick.

1. An Attorney General who's willing to prosecute a politician for that (usually someone who does that sort of thing only does so when a majority of a party backs them, if they enact something like that into law).

2. Conduct so egregious that the legal doctrine of ""Absolute Immunity"" doesnt apply. It's a legal doctrine that was put in place to prevent a politician from getting sued by everyone directly impacted by their laws/rulings, but has been grossly abused to such an extent, that i wouldnt be surprised to see it nearly nullified in the resulting implosion of the Republican party that's effectively inevitable. You normally have to prove that the conduct was so egregious that they no longer qualify for any protection of their office.

For part 1, good luck with that. Only a State AG can levy state charges like that, and in Texas, they definitely wont. For part 2, that depends on a jury. If I was on a jury, and i was presented with a scenario where a politician deliberately and willfully ignored what the majority of both domestic and foreign policy experts said to do, and knowing it would cause harm, for no appreciable gain, then yes, I would absolutely vote to convict.",2024_10_31

"From Semafor's Rachyl Jones:

Elon Musk’s employees may share his visions of colonizing Mars, building electric robotaxis, implanting brain chips, and digging holes. But they don’t share his politics.

Workers at his three biggest companies — X, Tesla, and SpaceX — have overwhelmingly donated to Democratic candidates and political action committees this election cycle, even as Musk has spent more than $75 million to elect former President Donald Trump and other Republicans. Their donations are mostly relatively small and given directly to the candidates. The data suggest that Musk’s companies follow the new Silicon Valley pattern — familiar across industries — in which the rank-and-file often support Democrats as executives lean Republican.

The donations align with past contributions. In 2020, employees from SpaceX and Tesla respectively donated seven and nine times the amount to Democratic candidates and their PACs than to the GOP, OpenSecrets data shows. Employees at Twitter, which Musk did not own at the time, contributed 15 times more money to Democrats or progressive-leaning PACs during that election cycle, according to OpenSecrets. Representatives from SpaceX, Tesla, and X did not respond to Semafor’s requests for comment.

As of today, of the 1.55M votes cast in PA, 58% have been cast by registered dems, 32% have been cast by registered republicans, and the 10% cast by registered independents are swinging to Harris by nearly 2/3. Not only that, but the republicans that historically vote on Election Day have already voted. The only republicans left in PA are the most unreliable voters that probably won’t vote at all. The dems still have a solid stock of reliable Election Day voters, so this is no “blue mirage”. She is outperforming the polls by 20%, thanks to women who are presently 56% of the electorate in PA.

Cross reference this with the readout on 538 for an interactive way to maybe deduce some of those discrepancies. Trump sued PA today, right? Well, PA is listed at ""Even"". Their internal polls likely indicate it is very much so not ""even"".

Vote, keep it going, blue all down ticket, Harris/Walz. Bring it home guys, it's just a few days away and if we can really do this, ***can you imagine the implosion that will inevitably happen with the Republican party after yet another Presidential loss? (and maybe even more stinging losses in House/Senate).***

If we win the Presidential this year, it will then make it so the only Presidential term they had was with Trump for a mere 4 years which will then be forever sandwiched in between *8 years* of Democrats **before** Trump and another **8 years** of Democrats *after*.

Do you think the Republican party is seriously just going to go ""back to business""? Trump's crimes and his cases that he's only been able to stall, will finally come to fruition and he'll have nowhere else to go. **Because of this** he is guaranteed to state (publicly and privately and through official paperwork) as soon as humanly possible that he will actually be running for President in 2028. It's the only ""feasible"" move he can do to try and stall shit in court moreso. I mean it likely won't work, he exhausted most of it out, but never stopped the actual charges or the cases in the first place.

He's going to need all that free ""ad/mind space"" in front of as many eyes as possible and he's not going to want any other Republican coming along, winning and then showing the world how much easier it was for **that** Republican to win than him. **Republicans are legit stuck with him**.

If we win this time, he's literally going to be a permanent problem for them and a fading problem for everyone else. This is why Graham said Trump would destroy the GOP. It's because he knew 100% that the party would....simply just let it happen. He didn't think Trump was some brilliant demolitions expert, he *knew* that the entire Republican party (including himself) would simply jump at the chance to suck down Trump's gravy.

Graham was actually being honest about *himself*, not about Trump (in that famous Tweet). Let's crush this one and send these dipshits packing. His (obvious, even at the time) projection came through in where he directed his blame: ""HE will destroy the GOP"". He actually **meant** ""we're going to let him"". Another Trump loss is **guaranteed to further prove what Graham said and will do so FAR faster than anything else.**

GOP knows this: see all their vote suppression work, including from the USSC just today.

Back to polling... no polls seriously estimate enthusiasm and it's hard to gauge anyway.

Also, I question if any pollster has the balls to have a number that swings too far to one candidate. Pollsters really fucked up in 2016 and I don't think they want to fuck up again.

Non-statistical sources of error are the whole problem we're talking about here; the researcher (or research analyst most likely) /chooses/ how much weight to assign to a number of hard to get a handle on sources of inaccuracy, and generally choose the narrowest as a sort of conservatism I disagree with, but which also has the result of making survey / poll results look more accurate than they are.

My hunch would've been that relative to the average American I'm informed about scams, security, etc., & I'm in the camp of silencing unknown numbers & ignoring texts about polls just as much as other spam texts. Trump's whole grift seems painfully transparent to me, & I'd expect people who trust him & buy his wildly overvalued DJT stock or bibles or whatever, to on average be more likely to engage with unknown numbers, & specifically with polling requests in order to express their support for Trump.


I know there's the ""shy Trump voter"" theory to attempt to explain 2016 & 2020, but anecdotally my Trump supporting friends & neighbors are not shy about it. Perhaps that's not representative of Trump voters as a whole, or there's been a shift between '16 & '24 though...


Because I'm trying to see why polls would suddenly be off in the other direction when they understated Trump's support more in '20 than '16. Idk what the response rate was in '20, but it's reasonable to assume it was below 9% on the way down to 0.4%. It wouldn't make intuitive sense that the 9% that respond would be slightly less Republican, the 3% that respond are *much* less so, then down at 0.4% they suddenly skew Republican...


That seems to weaken the case for my hunch/hope, but I know any actual factors from '16 to '20 to '24 could just be overpowered by the noise of variability. It's just the polls have not been wildly inconsistent with each other this year, so I'm interested what everyone might be getting wrong in one direction or the other. Last night I asked GPT to pretend it's a week after the election & Harris greatly outperformed polls, & to explain the most likely cause(s). It provided a thorough breakdown, but overall it was more about late shifts in turnout among specific demographics than the polls being off all along. ",2024_10_31

If 25 years ago they had to call 5,000 people in Kansas to get the 1,000 people in Kansas necessary to be the representative sample and now they have to call 15,000 people to get the necessary 1,000 people it doesnt matter.  So long as they get the representative 1,000 people thats all that matter.    Theyre still getting the same representative sample just not as easily

"Very good point; that was possibly the worst link to have used, as it never explicitly mentions cellphones. My bad. Here are some more that directly address the question:

[Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/110383/does-gallup-call-cell-phones.aspx)

>Gallup includes cellphones in each national Gallup poll. Gallup has been including cellphone-only households in all national telephone Gallup polls since January 2008. Further, cellphone-only households are now as likely to fall into national Gallup polls samples as those living in traditional landline households.

[New York  Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/upshot/midterms-polling-phone-calls.html)

>What about cellphones? Finally, an easy one: We call cellphones and landlines! About three-quarters of our calls go to cellphones nowadays — including nearly every call to young people.

[Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2018/10/09/performance-of-the-samples/)

>A look at the cellphones dialed in the RBS and RDD surveys provides a more apple-to-apples comparison. In both surveys, when calling a cellphone number, interviewers attempted to complete the survey with whomever answered the phone provided that the person was age 18 or older. The cellphone response rate was 6% in both surveys.

[Marist](https://maristpoll.marist.edu/methods/)

>Currently, more than half of our national sample is obtained from a mobile telephone frame. Proportions may be adjusted in state and city projects based on cell-phone-only populations from the most current National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Wireless Substitution Estimates. Mobile phones are treated as individual devices. After validation of age, personal ownership, and non-business-use of the mobile phone, interviews are typically conducted with the person answering the phone.

[PBS](https://www.pbs.org/publiceditor/blogs/pbs-public-editor/the-problem-with-polls/)

>The Associated Press guidelines, to which PBS NewsHour adheres, use the known probability standard — the one Marist uses.  Polls that rely on a random sample of a population in which every member has a known probability of inclusion, “are known as probability-based polls, and they are the best method of ensuring the results of a survey reflect the true opinion of the group being surveyed,” the AP Stylebook 2022 edition states. 

>The AP, and Marist, recognize that a plurality of American adults do not have a landline. Polls that are “conducted by telephone must include people interviewed on their cellphones,” according to the Stylebook. “Those that only include landline interviews have no chance of reaching the more than half of American adults who have only a mobile phone.” 

[Quinnipiac](https://poll.qu.edu/methodology/)

"Tell me, where is he picking up votes from 2020? The answer is nowhere.",2024_10_31
"Yep, they are so emboldened here in NYC…to each their own, but Harris people just carry on quietly, while the MAGAs are the loud in-your-face crowd.",2024_10_31
"> Trump will absolutely run again in 2028 

Only if he's still alive and his brain still halfway functions.


Let me revise that, being his brain already is below 50%.  If is brain 10% functions",2024_10_31
No way does he get the funding. Not a chance.,2024_10_31
"> Trump will absolutely run again in 2028

No chance. He's running on fumes right now.",2024_10_31
"What is the game here? Close polls will encourage more voters to participate, voter participation always favors democrats. 

The only thing I can think of is that if it's a blow out the Trumpers can say ""they obviously cheated, all the polls showed a close race!""",2024_10_31
"Right, but then it's literally impossible for them to ever be wrong by their own rules. That's just stupid.

They've been wrong in their polling for the past several elections. 2022 was incredibly off. Anyone saying it was ""historically accurate"" just because they were able to guess the margins within 4% or whatever is a fool. I could pull numbers out of my ass and be within 4% of the swing states",2024_10_31
"But when they predict a red wave and the exact opposite happens, that's not accuracy. If I predict that the NL East will dominate in the playoffs based on my algorithm predicting a 75% chance of it happening, that means I was incredibly wrong if it doesn't happen.",2024_10_31
"""Competent"" in the sense of ""he can keep a lid on his shit and operate strategically to advance his agenda,"" not in the sense of actually being good.  The only reason things aren't a hell of a lot worse already is because Trump was so atrocious at staying focused.  He was easily distracted and redirected by the last person to speak with him, and his ego kept him from getting his way long-term.  In essence, he was his own worst enemy and kept getting in his own way; his successor likely won't do that as much.",2024_10_31
"I mean, even if democrats win the next 3-4 elections, MAGA is just gonna keep coming back every 4 years like IT coming back every 33 years.

I don't think after Trump loses (making that hard assumption lol) they suddenly scatter to the wind like ""awww oh well""",2024_10_31
