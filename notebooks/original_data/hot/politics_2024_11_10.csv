"> within 15 years. It's been 40.

On Climate, failure is a matter of degrees. 

if we wanted to restrict long-term global warming to ""Pre-1990 levels"" with short term at no more than +2C we had to peak in 1995 and return to net zero by the early 2000s. We missed that.

Next was ""restrict long-term warming to +1 C or less compared to pre-1990 levels"" - we blew that one in the early 00's. 

Now we're at ""Restrict long-term warming to +2 C with short term below +3C"" and we've got about 40 months to go on that. 

Next comes ""Restrict long-term warming to +3 C..."" 

Each of these steps represents a worse, more extreme, less hospitable, and less habitable world than the one before it, but +3 C is better than +4 , and +4 is better than +5, and we're not really to ""it's all she wrote"" til we're past +8 C. 

The part where we're playing with fire is that the consequences of each degree higher is harder to predict, and there may be positive feedback loops that will kick-in that could mean there *isn't* an equilibrium at +3 or +4 so we'll overshoot even if we stop.

It is simply not possible. You will not have the larger team around him that is essential to running our government up to speed and available to enter into leadership positions across our government.

This is what we should expect. Jon Oliver's recent pieces on Trump went into how he handled the proper way of doing things the first time. 

Like is it required to release your tax returns? No, so he didn't do it. Is it required to put your assets into a blind trust? No, so he didn't do it. 

The ethics agreement might have a mandatory part to it but any past norms won't apply to Trump. He's going to be leading with Musk, RFK Jr, crypto bros and Linda McMahon all on key positions. He didn't give a shit about proper norms in 2016 and he certainly won't now.

[Besides his sexual proclivities](https://www.thedailybeast.com/listen-to-the-jeffrey-epstein-tapes-i-was-donald-trumps-closest-friend/)

Epstein also claimed that while Trump has friends, he was at heart a friendless man incapable of kindness.

On the tape Epstein can be heard saying, “He’s a horrible human being. He does nasty things to his best friends, best friends’ wives, anyone who he first tries to gain their trust and uses it to do bad things to them.”

On one occasion, Epstein alleged, Trump took a woman to what he called “the Egyptian Room” in an Atlantic City casino. Epstein alleged, “He came out afterward and said, ‘It was great, it was great. The only thing I really like to do is f— the wives of my best friends. That is just the best.’”

Epstein also alleged that Trump had an elaborate scheme to procure sex with his friends’ wives. He would call the men into his Trump Tower office to ask them about their sex lives and offer them sex with beauty pageant contestants, the pedophile said. He would do this while the wives were—unknown to their husbands—listening on speakerphone, so that he could then seduce the wives on the basis their husbands had betrayed them, Epstein claimed.

The Epstein tape includes an allegation—which is impossible to verify—that Trump had an affair with a politician while in the White House. Epstein offered no proof or sourcing for the claim. He also alleged that Trump cheated on both his first wife Ivana and second wife Marla Maples with “a Black girl.” At one section, Epstein used a Yiddish racial slur to refer to Black women and alleged Trump boasted to him, “I’m f—ing all these Black women.”

Epstein compared Trump to “an emotionally challenged 9-year-old,” and said, “He screams and yells at Rhona more than anybody else. His screaming is how he treats people. He has a tantrum, not a temper. If you don’t understand him, it’s frightening. Once you understand him, it’s sort of silly.”

Startlingly for a man who became one of the world’s most notorious sex offenders, Epstein on the tapes offers a damning judgment of Trump, telling Wolff, “The moral compass just does not exist.” The tape mixes sexual allegations with other aspects of Trump’s life. Early in the recording Epstein is heard to say, “You probably know he had a scalp reduction. He’s getting the same male pattern baldness that we all have. He had his scalp reduced. It’s hysterical.” Trump has long refused to release full medical records while his White House medical reports did not disclose any prior surgeries.

"To my great shame, I have just started to do so. I figured that MAGA was going to be a fad and that it would be over after he lost in 2020. 

So far I have had an OK start to this, but it is way too early to tell how this is going to go.

But my reason for trying is pretty simple - this election went this way in part because people are not listening and we have forgotten how to talk to each other. 

That and I looked at how some folks were voting. In Florida you have people voting 55% for Trump, but then 58% for abortion rights.

In Nevada you have 50% of the population voting for Trump, but then only 47% of the population voting for Kari Lake (basically MAGA Trump Senator), who lost her race.

Maybe I am looking to far into this, but what this tells me is that some MAGA folks might be persuaded to vote on things that are important to me. So in Florida, maybe we cannot convince those that voted for Trump to vote Democrat next time.

But may be we can get enough people to change their mind at get that 2% needed to pass abortion rights. But that only happens if we talk to people in an open and fair minded way. 

I am ***not*** saying to abandon principles and compromise on values, though of course. But a genuine conversation if possible should be attempted.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Refuse to cooperate in federal investigations.

Refuse to allow red states to operate in their jurisdictions.

Refuse to send revenues if they are feeling really bold.

Refuse to allow Republican-aligned state officials to even assume official duties (political identity is not a protected class, and never has been, and it is in fact, per extensive precedent, lawful to discriminate on the basis of).

Crack down hard on alt right politics in police forces.

Prevent new red voters from moving into the state.

">but it would be better for the US if he and his advisors were fully briefed when they started.

I mean, we've already seen what happens in that situation, and the result was quite literally worse than nothing.

It's traditional for the outgoing presidental team to run a ""Wargame"" for the incoming team to get them some practice with dealing with crises.

The scenario in 2016 was about *a novel pandemic caused by virus originating in China*. They responded by dismantling the disaster-response mechanisms *that were already in place for that sort of situation*, for no other reason than to give a great big ""Fuck You"" to Obama.

Trump's team was literally handed the answers to the test on a silver platter, and they still somehow managed to score *worse than random chance*.

----

The GOP has openly, explicitly stated its intentions to dismantle the constitution and install a fascist one-party  dictatorship-for life; and the Democrat leadership has made it clear that they have zero interest in actually **doing anything** to prevent this. Now that the concept of ""Checks and Balances"" is dead and its corpse defiled, the continued existence of the United States as a democracy depends **entirely** on them being *too incompetent* to finish the job before 2026.

"A little military trivia that I am confident was intentional:

The Army requires soldiers to speak the Oath of Enlistment. It includes a line about obeying the President and their officers.

Officers also have one, the Oath of Commissioned Officers. It says nothing about obeying the President, Congress, or anyone else. Officers are only swearing to obey and uphold the Constitution.

And this is only what is said out loud. Officers also trend more liberal than you would expect.

The US military has deep and old traditions. You'll never find a cult with the same intensity, the same loyalty, or sense of purpose as a longstanding professional military. No President could meaningfully change the US military in 8 years without replacing every servicemember and every document. 

A President might be in charge, but they don't make the rules.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Let's get back to the '50s when you could rape your wife legally and she couldn't own a credit card or a bank account or a fucking house without her father cosigning for it. I totally get it. 

And for the ability for you to say all these things you have willingly and knowingly put a person into office that will put people into the supreme Court who will fuck our employment laws for the next 50 years You know overtime businesses can challenge that and because we have a supreme Court that's that fucking conservative and is bought and paid for by the corporations they can decide you're right it is not legal for us to force you to pay overtime that law is unconstitutional. They've already decided warrantless searches in your house if you live within 100 mi of a fucking river or body of water  that is patrolled by border guards or the Coast guard which is every major navigable waterway in the United States.

Civil forfeiture eminent domain the fact that they've said that you have no right to privacy medical privacy any insurance agency any company can sue and take it up to the supreme Court on the grounds that you are not guaranteed privacy that is not a right that you have so they should be able to get your medical documents and the insurance companies should be able to take those medical documents and decide what you can and can't be covered by. All that needs to happen is a corporation needs to go up there and since they've already declared that bribes are not illegal get some of the justices some new boats let him take their yachts out for months at a time And bam they get to charge your insurance rate based on Your health records and sell those records to other people. 

You enjoy working on your car and repairing shit well all the company has to do now Handover some company stock, give their wife or nephew son daughter whatever some bullshit job in their company paying him a million dollars a year.

The Dems care about virtue-signalling above all else.  As such, they always have to be The Good Guys.  Always.  They can't ever do anything untoward.  Ever.

So, what happens when you have someone like RBG - or Biden?  Someone who is far too old and needs to step down?  They're narcissists, so they'll never step down willingly.  

Well, you have a problem...  Forcing someone to step down, simply because of their age - is ageist!  It's wrong.  The Good Guys would never do that.

Similarly, forcing someone to step down - because, if they stay on, your side will lose the Supreme Court for a generation - is wrong!  That's *playing the game*.  That's akin to cheating.  The Good Guys don't cheat!  Even if it's within-the-rules!  The Good Guys don't corruptly manipulate the Supreme Court, oh god no, that would be wrong.

Forcing someone to step down, because the party will be far better off with the younger-generation in-charge - is also wrong!  It's playing politics.  Politics should never enter into it.  If you force someone to step down, there has to be a very good reason.  Like criminality or sexual-harassment or something.

"> Gallego announced his challenge to Sinema even before she made clear she would not be seeking another term, putting Senate Democrats in a temporarily awkward position of possibly having to choose which Democrat they would support.

Yep. We could realistically have pretty good 2026 midterms and a 2028 sweep.,2024_11_10,06_45_08

15 million protest votes that’s just wild to believe.,2024_11_10,06_45_08
After California is done counting Harris will be at minimum 72-73 million votes. So it’s not 15 million. Still a lot less than Biden but we can’t deny the issue is inflation. Democrats need to just stop with the culture wars with the other side when inflation was a serious issue. Regular Americans basically said no inflation was affecting us,2024_11_10,06_45_08

It used to be that Republicans showed up in midterms and Dems only came out in presidential elections.  Trump has flipped the script on that.  That’s part of why I think there was false hope Harris would win based on turnout in 2022. Normally the party in power loses seats in the midterms.  Let’s hope that stays true.,2024_11_10,06_45_08

Shit, here in BC, easily the most left-wing part of Canada, we maintained a left-wing majority by ONE SEAT DECIDED BY 22 VOTES to a party that hasn't won a single seat in the province prior since the 60's (There's more to it than that but still) simply because inflation is high, people are stupid and the NDP was in power.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Russia hacked the vote.

From the image:

Gov. of Pennsylvania J. Shapiro, et. al.
Nov. 7th 2024

This is a formal Duty to Warn Letter. Per DNI Dir. Clapper’s 2015 directive to all agencies and contractors associated with intelligence and financial agency technologies. I have a Duty to Warn of suspicions of hacking, and have done so for my customers including Govt. Agencies, Dept. of Defense, F100 firms and numerous banks. I do so here as a directly affected voter.

Nearly all my investigations begin for one of two reasons. The hackers make a mistake triggering a system issue and/or the aggregate effects of the hacking creates results outside nominal expectations. There is a third and less common flag; an unrelated distraction to draw attention away from the hacking.

All three of these indicators are present in the election of Nov. 5th 2024. Element three, distraction via bomb-threats, is confirmed coming from Russian agencies. Element one is the inexplicable mismatch of reported votes vs. voter turnout. Here in Centre County initial tabulation was an absurdly low 67K votes when over 80K voters participated. Element two is also present. Our local scanner systems worked in testing, but were unable to communicate properly with tabulation systems after the bomb-scare. I note from experience - the failure of a scanning systems to properly load a database is an extremely common development when a system is changed without notice to the users. I have personally worked on similar issues where sudden scanner configuration failures were the first symptoms of system hacking.

With these three elements present, I suggest immediately doing a relatively simple set of preliminary checks. First, randomly selected precincts require manual comparisons of the number of voters who took ballots vs the scanned output of vote totals. Those did not match here in Centre County by apx 13K votes. Once added, those votes substantially changed outcomes and led to the outright reversals in multiple Centre County races.

Centre County BOE now shows vote totals over 80K votes. Apx. 6% above 2020 turnout. In my professional opinion every county in PA as well as many in WI, MI and GA currently reporting lower vote totals vs. 2020 and/or also experienced a distraction bomb threat should undertake the same process My professional opinion is: many thousands of voters are being disenfranchised, likely by a malicious actor via errors in tabulation software. My concern has been proven correct and warranted here in Centre County PA.

There is one thing that really bugs me, who didn't vote.  Harris got 15 million less votes than Biden in 2020 which Trump got 2 million less.  It seems to me that the same people voted for Trump less those who have shuffled off this mortal coil.  Harris should have smoked him if not for that 15 million that didn't vote.  

So, someone, please, tell me who didn't vote.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Especially because there was actual money riding on this election due to allowing wagers on the outcome of the 2024 election.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"That's what could be a legitimate conspiracy. They spent so much money coming up with bogus claims in 2020 even if they knew it wouldn't stick and would be easily debunked, one can only guess why. One answer to that would be that they wanted to set the public opinion that election fraud is ridiculous and anyone who would claim it afterwards would look like a hypocrite, and that's partly why the media and Democrats won't even dare to approach the subject. The other answer is that they went through it to learn all about the process and what security measures were in place in order to study it and find holes in them.

I don't want to be the lunatic here. Just because I would like to believe it could be true doesn't mean I will be swayed by a dozen anodectal stories of people who say their ballots were returned. But if it becomes in the hundreds maybe I would. There's a difference between baseless election fraud accusations like we saw in 2020, and some that could hold ground. I know a lot of states have a very solid anti-fraud  procedural strategy in place, but I also believe some other smaller counties don't. And yes I also know the results are within the margin of errors of polling so that doesn't help this theory.

A lot of people say the Trump numbers are so high that it couldn't possibly be explained with fraud, but I disagree, the vast majority of counties had a less than 2% vote difference, many even <1%. It just takes one small change here and here to affect 1000 votes in the proper location to change the whole picture. Also the fact that they were saying everywhere we had a record number of voters and it doesn't match in the total count, the fact that Dems had a favorable approval rating, the fact their rally had so much more people than the other side.

"You need to get your memory checked because that is absolutely not what his report showed. Here’s a small taste of what was actually uncovered by his investigation.

* 		Russia engaged in extensive attacks on the U.S. election system in 2016 
* 		Russian interference in the 2016 election was “sweeping and systemic.”
* 		Major attack avenues included a social media “information warfare” campaign that “favored” candidate Trump and the hacking of Clinton campaign-related databases and release of stolen materials through Russian-created entities and Wikileaks.
* 		Russia also targeted databases in many states related to administering elections gaining access to information for millions of registered voters.
 
The investigation “identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign” and established that the Trump Campaign “showed interest in WikiLeaks’s releases of documents and welcomed their potential to damage candidate Clinton” 
* 		In 2015 and 2016, Michael Cohen pursued a hotel/residence project in Moscow on behalf of Trump while he was campaigning for President. Then-candidate Trump personally signed a letter of intent.
* 		Senior members of the Trump campaign, including Paul Manafort, Donald Trump, Jr., and Jared Kushner took a June 9, 2016, meeting with Russian nationals at Trump Tower, New York, after outreach from an intermediary informed Trump, Jr., that the Russians had derogatory information on Clinton that was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”
* 		Beginning in June 2016, a Trump associate “forecast to senior [Trump] Campaign officials that WikiLeaks would release information damaging to candidate Clinton.” A section of the Report that remains heavily redacted suggests that Roger Stone was this associate and that he had significant contacts with the campaign about Wikileaks.
* 		The Report described multiple occasions where Trump associates lied to investigators about Trump associate contacts with Russia. Trump associates George Papadopoulos, Rick Gates, Michael Flynn, and Michael Cohen all admitted that they made false statements to federal investigators or to Congress about their contacts. In addition, Roger Stone faces trial this fall for obstruction of justice, five counts of making false statements, and one count of witness tampering.
* 		The Report contains no evidence that any Trump campaign official reported their contacts with Russia or WikiLeaks to U.S. law enforcement authorities during the campaign or presidential transition, despite public reports on Russian hacking starting in June 2016 and candidate Trump’s August 2016 intelligence briefing warning him that Russia was seeking to interfere in the election.
* 		The Report raised questions about why Trump associates and then-candidate Trump repeatedly asserted Trump had no connections to Russia.
 
Special Counsel Mueller declined to exonerate President Trump and instead detailed multiple episodes in which he engaged in obstructive conduct
* The investigation produced 37 indictments; seven guilty pleas or convictions; and compelling evidence that the president obstructed justice on multiple occasions. Mueller also uncovered and referred 14 criminal matters to other components of the Department of Justice.
* 		Trump associates repeatedly lied to investigators about their contacts with Russians, and President Trump refused to answer questions about his efforts to impede federal proceedings and influence the testimony of witnesses.
* 		A statement signed by over 1,000 former federal prosecutors concluded that if any other American engaged in the same efforts to impede federal proceedings the way Trump did, they would likely be indicted for multiple charges of obstruction of justice.

* The redactions of the Mueller Report appear to conceal the extent to which the Trump campaign had advance knowledge of the release of hacked emails by WikiLeaks. For instance, redactions conceal content of discussions that the Report states occurred between Trump, Cohen, and Manafort in July 2016 shortly after Wikileaks released hacked emails; the Report further notes, “Trump told Gates that more releases of damaging information would be coming,” but redacts the contextual information around that statement.
* 		A second issue the Report does not examine is the fact that the President was involved in conduct that was the subject of a case the Special Counsel referred to the Southern District of New York – which the Report notes “ultimately led to the conviction of Cohen in the Southern District of New York for campaign-finance offenses related to payments he said he made at the direction of the President.”
* 		The Report also redacts in entirety its discussion of 12 of the 14 matters Mueller referred to other law enforcement authorities.
* 		Further, the Report details non-cooperation with the inquiry by the President, including refusing requests by the Special Counsel for an interview; providing written responses that the Office of the Special Counsel considered “incomplete” and “imprecise” and that involved the President stating on “more than 30 occasions that he ‘does not recall’ or ‘remember’ or ‘have an independent recollection.



He was never exonerated nor cleared of anything and large parts of the report are still redacted.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
Said someone who hasn't read the Mueller report.  Who's stupid now?,2024_11_10,06_45_08
"An AI summary: In his 2019 report, Mueller stated specifically that the investigation did not conclude that Trump was “exonerated” on charges of obstruction of justice. The report covered two main areas: possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump in relation to the investigation itself.

Here’s a summary of Mueller’s key findings:
	1.	Collusion with Russia: Mueller’s team did not find sufficient evidence to charge Trump or his campaign with criminal conspiracy or coordination with Russia. However, the report detailed numerous interactions between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials. Mueller noted that although there was evidence of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in these activities.
	2.	Obstruction of Justice: The report documented 10 instances where Trump potentially obstructed justice. However, Mueller refrained from reaching a conclusion on whether Trump committed a criminal offense, in part due to Department of Justice (DOJ) guidelines against indicting a sitting president. Mueller explained that he did not exonerate Trump on obstruction charges, and that if the investigation could have cleared Trump of wrongdoing, it would have stated so explicitly.

In summary, while Mueller did not find enough evidence to charge Trump with collusion and did not make a definitive ruling on obstruction, the report explicitly states that it does not exonerate him. The investigation left room for Congress to consider the findings for further action, which later led to an impeachment inquiry focused on different issues .",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Yeah, Trump corruptly attempted to overturn the results by pressuring secretary of states and was part of a large conspiracy to send fake electors for certification for several states.  He should be in jail, not heading back to the White House. There have been no credible claims of Election fraud on the part of the Democratic party. Trump himself has on occasion, admitted that he lost. Of course, like anything, he's not consistent on that front and alternately still makes absurd comments like ""I actually won California in 2020.""


I have full confidence that a majority of the people who voter for him this time would come to that conclusion if the damage of being lied to for decades could be undone. Unfortunately, the right wing media landscape is driven by disinformation, fear mongering, etc. That's not to say that there isn't propaganda on the other side, there certainly is. But the difference in degree is staggering.

The unfortunate truth is there are a lot of powerful and wealthy interests that help to push right wing agenda and Trump personally. Most rich people really care about tax cuts, even though they have more resources than they could use in a hundred life times. Often we hear about George Soros funding democrats, and various conspiracies surrounding his support. 

But on the right, we have Elon Musk, the richest person on Earth openly supporting Trump while controlling a large social media and being the recipient of huge government contracts. Human greed is what is driving the polarization, disinformation, and fear mongering in the media.

The culture war stuff is mostly a distraction to keep people  riled up about migrants eating pets, schools teaching kids about sex, and many more things. This distraction serves to keep the middle class and the working class will not unite in favor of policies that help the average American. It helps the rich to continue to transfer wealth away from everyday Americans and to increase the already staggering wealth disparity. This is out in the open too, Trump is a billionaire. How does the country vote for someone who so clearly isn't going to help them? Someone who only cares about lining his pockets. 

The answer is with a lot of help from partisan media companies, social media platforms, and funding from the rich. 

As an aside,  I'm not so naive to think that the Democrats don't suffer from some of the same problems. There's definitely a difference in magnitude - with Fox essentially being a full blown propaganda network for example. I believe Kamala's campaign moved towards centrist positions in order to gain support from CEOs and the wealthy. If the middle and working classes are able to heal this division and unite. We will be able to demand better politicians who support policies that will help everyone, and not just benefit the rich. That's a big ""if"" though.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

None of it adds up, but his side knows that Dems can't say anything back as that would make them exactly the same as what they've been condemning since 2020.

"I posted this in another thread yesterday but similar to what you’re saying:

There’s something interesting to look at. Let’s look at a sampling of major swing states that also have Senate elections this year: Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Trump is projected to win ALL of these yet for four out of five the Democrat is projected to win the Senate election at the same time, and the fifth it’s neck and neck with the Republican barely ahead while Trump is way ahead.

I know people don’t always vote for the same party for president and senator, but they usually do. Here’s the current voting numbers to compare and see the disparity:

Arizona

D: Senator-1,360,000 vs Harris-1,310,000 (-50,000)

R: Senator-1,353,000 vs Trump-1,492,000 (+139,000)

Nevada

D: Senator-675,000 vs Harris-678,000 (+3,000)

R: Senator-654,000 vs Trump-724,000 (+70,000)

Wisconsin

D: Senator-1,672,000 vs Harris-1,667,000 (-5,000)

R: Senator-1,643,000 vs Trump-1,697,000 (+54,000)

Michigan

D: Senator-2,708,000 vs Harris-2,724,000 (+16,000)

R: Senator-2,687,000 vs Trump-2,804,000 (+117,000)

Pennsylvania

D: Senator-3,327,000 vs Harris-3,364,000 (+37,000)

R: Senator-3,369,000 vs Trump-3,510,000 (+141,000)

For historical comparison, in 2020 there were NO states that voted for one party for president and another party for Senate (the only arguable one being Maine that gave electoral votes to both parties for president so whoever they voted into the Senate would contradict part of the state regardless).

As well, in 2016, there were absolutely ZERO states that voted one party for president and another for Senate.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Zero states split tickets for Senate and Presidency in 2016 and 2020? But 4 or 5 and counting split tickets in 2024? Wow.

In his bio of LBJ, Robert Caro documents the type of fraudulent ballot stuffing and vote buying that occurred in Texas during the early part of the 20th century. It’s important to note because election fraud is a real thing that has happened. 

I don’t want to come across as conspiratorial, but what strikes me as interesting about Caro’s history relevant to the above is that the ballot engineering went hand in hand with the vote counting. It was important, in part to disguise the fraud, that you only tipped the scales ever so slightly—only in the counties you needed it, only in counties where it could be explained, and only by margins that could be rationalized.

I’m not saying this election was rigged. I am saying that if the election were rigged, if someone had the means to buy votes or stuff the ballots or otherwise manipulate the count, isn’t the data you shared kinda what we’d expect to see?

Did this only happen in swing states? Did any other (non swing) states also split? Or did Trump only get these perfectly sized bumps exactly where he needed them most?

Edit: …Because if Trump’s surge can be explained by under voting then you’d expect to see under voting nationwide, wouldn’t you?

Edit 2: Yes. Yes. 

The question is not:

How is it possible that a Presidential candidate could receive more votes than a Senator?

Why is it happening at historically unprecedented rates in the swing states and is it happening at historically unprecedented rates *only* in the swing states?",2024_11_10,06_45_08

This makes sense to me when you see that Dearborn in Michigan lost to Trump and has a major Arab/Muslim population. These friends were also disgusted that their prize endorsement was from Liz Cheney, daughter of notorious war criminal Dick Cheney. Why would they vote for a candidate a Cheney is standing behind? If they wanted to vote for a Republican, they could. 

I'm sure there were other reasons, but Dems need to steer clear of conspiratory thinking and accept that they ran a poor campaign and got cumstered for it.

They don't give a damn about the party except insofar as it's a vehicle for Trump's ambitions. Hell, many of them think the Republicans are just as bad as the Democrats, and that Trump is the only politician they can trust.

"I hear what you are laying down. Please cite the data supporting the phenomenon of “under voting.” I’d never heard that term before. I looked it up. Contrary to your conclusion, it’s actually cause for concern.

You can’t wave your hands and say under voting happens, nothing to look at here; no more than I can say split ticket voting happens, there must be fraud. 

The thread above suggests there is not a pattern of split ticket voting and then something abnormal happens. The data suggests the abnormality.

If under voting is happening in a way that is consistent with other elections, etc, and we see that in the data, then that might be a counter argument. 

I am truly not a conspiratorial thinker. Maths matter.

Here’s what ChatGPT says when I asked what under voting is:

“Undervoting” refers to instances when a voter casts a ballot but leaves one or more races or ballot measures blank. In an undervote, the voter either intentionally skips a choice or accidentally leaves it blank, so no vote is recorded for that specific contest. Undervoting can occur in any election and is often monitored because it may indicate voter disinterest in certain races, confusion about the ballot, or issues with the voting process.

Undervotes are particularly scrutinized in close elections or in cases where high undervote rates could suggest possible problems with the ballot design or voting equipment. For example, undervoting in a presidential election might be concerning if it occurs in unusually high numbers, as it could suggest problems with ballot layout or mechanical errors that prevent votes from being properly recorded.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"I definitely understand you want for a source, but it would be hard for me to link you a single source. I’ve got a bachelors degree in political science and worked on multiple campaigns. That’s where my knowledge of under voting comes from. I can link you what an under vote is, and if I had the time or energy, I could go dig up some academic articles that explain when under voting is or is not a concern, but I think it would be better if you found that information yourself so you know I’m not just cherry picking sources. If you want to learn about it, I would suggest Google scholar and not just a regular search. Under voting isn’t talked about in the media very often because it’s mostly something that people who work on down ballot campaigns have to worry about, not something that particularly merits the general public attention. Trump just happens to have given us a national example of it this time.

I would love to clarify what under voting is for you, particularly on when it would indicate a problem and the type of problem it would be indicating. 

First, when chat, GPT says an under vote in a presidential election is a cause for concern, what that would mean would be the races for the lower offices and ballot measures were voted on, but president had been left blank. That would be an under vote in a presidential election. That is the opposite of what this data shows. What this data shows is an under vote in the Senate races. Meaning votes were cast for president, but no vote was cast for senate. If the under votes had been in the presidential race, that would genuinely be a cause for concern. That would be an alarm bell ringing moment. Because it is incredibly rare for the top ballot race, which in a presidential year is always the presidential race, to have significant under vote. That would indicate either fraud or an extreme issue with the way the ballot was designed or was being counted or something. 

There are two things that contribute to under voting, uninformed voters who don’t want to take the time to learn about a race or measure, and being further down the ballot (both voter fatigue and increasing obscurity make being down ballot worse for under votes). 

Trump won with the exact type of voters you would expect to not fill out down ballot races. Both people with less education and less time are more likely to leave portions of their ballot blank.

Calculating under vote in a state house race is actually specifically what my experience is in. It was my job to model what turned out in my statehouse race would be (typically 5 to 8 elections down the ballot) given predicted turnout for the election and historical under vote.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

The Democrats need a platform that emphasizes raising the floor for all, but also having no ceiling. I think that's where a lot of disagreement with the progressive wing of the party will come from, but I think a compromise is going to be necessary in order to be effective going forward. The floor *needs* raising/a rising tide lifts all boats. But I see no reason to tell people that there's a ceiling and, beyond that, you can't go further.

"I think the article hit on something very key which is that while Biden moved left in terms of economic policies, he did not use a narrative of class struggle nor name an enemy. Populism 101: you can’t do populism without naming an enemy. People understand stories about humans better than analytics about numbers. The democrats will never get credit for pro-worker policies if they continue to try and by a party for everyone, bosses and workers alike. “We will make the economy better for everyone” does not cut it. The reality is nothing the democrats could possibly do on a pro-worker polity front can fix in 4 years what has been 60 years of stagnant growth. “Too little too late” is an understatement about the Democrats shift to the left on economic issues in 2020. And more importantly, people need a story to hold onto. Marginal improvements in standards of living for this war the bottom may be appreciated but may still feel like crumbs when they look at wealth inequality only continuing to grow.

"Stupidity is holding up to scrutiny extremely well. I DNGAF how many people complain about their feelings being hurt and then spite voting anymore.

> The easy answer is inflation, but the case for this as the primary driver, materially rather than rhetorically, also has some holes. The first is that inflation has drastically decreased, and has been decreasing consistently since early in the Biden presidency.

The problem wasn't general inflation, it was inflation of specific goods whose prices going up was an immediate and tangible sort of thing relative to abstract economic stuff.

The ""my gas and eggs price went up, better vote for a fascist"" thing is real.


> I propose a different explanation than inflation qua inflation: the Covid welfare state and its collapse. The massive, almost overnight expansion of the social safety net and its rapid, almost overnight rollback are materially one of the biggest policy changes in American history. For a brief period, and for the first time in history, Americans had a robust safety net: strong protections for workers and tenants, extremely generous unemployment benefits, rent control and direct cash transfers from the American government.

This is a fair point. Getting helicopter money especially is one of those very immediate things voters remember. One of the best things Biden could have done is just do something very tangible for people near the end of the election. Dems kept reassuring people of the long term, but they didn't buy it and I don't see that changing.

> And why did most Americans vote for someone they believe will harm the country but help their own pocketbooks? The answer is the ongoing decimation of working class institutions and civil society, started by neoliberalism, accelerated by the rise of the internet as a medium of interaction and put into overdrive during the isolation of Covid. The vehicles for building solidarity with others and for caring about strangers have been decimated. In crass terms, people have become more selfish.

"I work in social services with low income clients, a population that historically seems to constantly vote against their own interests. 

Things are so bad for them, it seems like half my caseload has gotten evicted or on the brink of being evicted. Much of these are working families who can’t get their needs met. There is a severe lack of agencies with available funds when it comes to getting financial assistance, and the process is painfully bogged down and cumbersome. So if you work full time, good luck with that process.

IT’S RACISM. It’s literally just racism, misogyny, transphobia, bigotry, and antisemitism all. the. way. down. 

Know how I know? Because all of those voters who are like “blah blah gas eggs economy my investments” will get in a room with me, alone, and the *second* they think I think like they do, the mask is off and and it’s an unending deluge of racist, misogynistic tripe and whining about how women are all obnoxious now and don’t shave and bathroom bills and libraries and books and drag queens and Marxist universities and “black on black crime” and jokes about immigrants and blatant antisemitism. It takes them literally two minutes. They can’t wait to spew their hatred. 

People will argue with me and tell me that they really do care about the economy or whatever. I believe it! I also believe they are far more willing to scapegoat Black, Brown, queer, indigenous, and Jewish people because it confirms beliefs and stereotypes they already had. It confirms their misogynistic worldview and their tradwife garbage. The economy is the current convenient excuse to be loud and proud about their bigotry. And whew boy have they been waiting for this moment. 

All of the hot takes in the world about this are meaningless until we realize that as a country we have *never* even begun to reckon for the harm we’ve done, and even suggesting we do so is met with yet another firehose of bullshit American exceptionalism and violent nationalism masked as “patriotism.” 

I’m so tired of us not recognizing that this is the problem. I even think we could take steps toward fixing it, because I do think uplifting the working class and creating a rock solid social safety net, bolstering unions, and instituting universal health care would go a long way toward making these folks less likely to turn to easy scapegoats. Once people are more comfortable and safe, it’s easier to bring them to the table about the other stuff.

"The truth is that Trump and the rise of MAGA is a ""death by a thousand cuts"" problem. 

- Media not talking about Trump in a serious way since 2015. 

- ***Republicans going along with his lawlessness and hatred.*** (This is a major one. It gives a permission structure for half the country).

- Citizens that are not paying attention due to apathy, being too busy, just trying to live life, etc. I don't fault citizens too much for this since I get how people can be disengaged. 

- Citizens not doing due diligence. This I have a little less empathy for. If you are tuning in to the political process, you also need to do the work. It was shocking how many people did not understand what a tariff did and how it works. 

- Democrats being too much of a coward to actually do what needs to be done. I think they've been outmaneuvered by Republicans in this way. They need to be more aggressive and play more hardball. In this way, we need younger leadership and Democrats that are willing to meet the moment. 

- DOJ being slow to move on Trump's crimes after Jan 6th. THIS I have some understanding as of why it took so long. We have never done this as a country before, so they wanted to do it right and make sure it didn't throw our system into chaos. Well, it didn't and we still got a lot of shit done. Importantly, it broke the seal on charging even presidents with crimes. So even though Trump got off on some of his bullshit, it still happened. We are now like other countries in that way...at least partly. Yay progress? 

- Democrats not listening to the people. Sander's critique of the Democrat party after this election was spot on. 

- More abstractly, when things are not good people often do not give a flying fuck what you've done or what you plan to do. They will almost always blame those in power. Something like 60% of this country is living pay check to pay check. They may not agree with Republicans or Trump, but they're willing to just try something else at least.

"The usual explanations (immigration, inflation, etc) don't hold up to scrutiny. Inflation was worse in 2022 [1], yet Democrats did fine in the midterm election; why would it matter more now? Most Americans have never seen or met an illegal immigrant; why are they suddenly so anti-immigrant?

My pet theory has always been that policy matters, of any kind, are at best tangential to Trump's appeal. He was a TV star; as a billionaire, he represents an aspirational icon; and as a politician, he is clearly unconventional. If you've ever spoken to a Trump voter, you know that the trust Trump even when confronted with evidence that he's lying. So if Trump tells them that inflation is bad and is Biden's fault, and that immigration is bad and is Biden's fault, they trust him.

What can be learned from this is that charisma matters, especially in today's Youtube universe. Giving long, rambling, unscripted interviews with Joe Rogan [2] and Theo Von was key. People want to form a parasocial relationship with their politicians. They want to feel that politicians can talk to them like human beings, and make jokes, and relax, rather than just give canned speeches that sound like every other political speech.

For better or for worse, Trump has mastered the art of convincing people to form a parasocial relationship with him; that's why he inspires such trust, despite copious evidence of not deserving that trust [3]. Bernie and Obama and even GWB had some of that personal charm that makes you ""want to get a beer with them."" Harris did not. And here we are.

In conclusion, most Americans are not in a position to understand policy or to vote rationally on the basis of policy. So they vote with their ""gut,"" which means that parties must be careful to choose candidates who inspire people's emotions, not just their brains.

And Harris had huge rallies and trump had empty arenas, and we saw the long lines for early voting and day of voting and were told fewer people voted this time than 2020?

It is very difficult for centrist candidates to describe their proposed policies into neat little sound bites.

"I do believe that the trans children ads and trans women competing in sports with genetic women is 100% part of the equation. All the polling coming out suggested that they were deeply unpopular and turned voters off from voting for Trump.

However, all 7 swing states with latinos and hispanics and women all turned the other way and voted for him. So I think it is time to cut out the trans surgery dialogue by politicians throughout the country. Maybe places like Calibronia can get away with it, but if they ever run  for national office, it could backfire on them too. A lot of the trans stuff is simply not explained well at all by people like Harris, and that's not her fault. She is a great speaker when she has recited. She is not an on-the-spot and spontaneous speaker. If she was she would have done far more media appearances without using the ""I'm from the middle class, I love small businesses, I wanna give tax credits, down-payment assistance, etc"" script every single time. She never really gave many opinions on complex questions during interviews. When asked her thoughts on the economy she just replied ""the economy is hard, but I'm from the middle class. I know what it is like. And my newborn child tax credit will help everyone."" No, it'll help like 1% of voters. Throw out a new fucking tax reform proposal WITHOUT talking about unrealized gains taxes. You win by telling normal ass working voters you will reduce their effective tax rate. People don't really understand tax credits. CPAs fill that shit out for their dumbasses.

It’s not like Democrats haven’t been pushing for stuff that actually helps the middle class—healthcare that doesn’t bankrupt you, relief from student debt, climate policies that protect jobs. But here’s the thing: the way people get their news has totally changed, and now places like Twitter and big podcasts have become giant megaphones for MAGA talking points.

With Musk running Twitter, conservative voices are everywhere on there, and the biggest podcasts are pumping fear about inflation, “kids getting sex changes,” immigration “ruining” the country—you name it. That’s what people are seeing every day, not the stuff Democrats have actually done. And with Citizens United, billionaires can throw as much money as they want into campaigns, just pushing this messaging harder. It’s not that Democrats turned their backs on the middle class; it’s that their message got buried under a wave of fear-based narratives that took over the platforms people actually use.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Exactly. Many voters are entirely misinformed and vote based on Republican propaganda. Look at the vote spread of people who think there’s a horde of illegal immigrants streaming into the country even though most of them are immediately deported after CBP encounters or awaiting court hearings, the people who think inflation is at record highs because they don’t understand inflation isn’t just their groceries going up, the people who think we’re giving billions in cash to Ukraine as aid when almost all of it is surplus military equipment, the people who blame Biden for tax raises signed by Trump, etc.

My state specifically had a ton of Arab Americans flip to Trump or refuse to vote over Gaza. They’re complete idiots because Trump will be 100x worse: it’s a kneejerk emotional reaction without any understanding of the actual consequences or out of a desire for revenge on Biden/Harris.

Same thing with voters at large: try explaining to your average American how Trump’s economic policies+his disastrous handling of COVID crashed the economy, how Biden and the Fed had to pull the US out and higher inflation is common after quantitative easing, how the US is actually doing pretty well compared to other countries and inflation is down now without a recession, how deflation is actually bad for the economy, etc. and you get blank stares and cries about groceries being cheaper under Trump with zero understanding of basic macroeconomics or monetary policy. 

Meanwhile the guy who just got elected is promising tariffs on all imports and higher tariffs on China, which will absolutely ruin the economy that the US has spent the past 4 years finally stabilizing after COVID, but the average American has no idea about his plans or has no idea what tariffs are. The logical answer to being better off with expanded emergency social safety in 2020/2021 is to vote for the party promising more social safety nets, not the one that consistently opposes them. Trump will not restore those programs and will actively make life worse for the vast majority of this country.

Trump’s previous tariffs forced the government to bail out farmers who lost their Chinese market forever: those people went to Brazilian farmers instead, and stayed there even after Trump’s tariffs were lifted. His steel tariffs led to layoffs and rising prices, same with lumber and other raw materials.

This influenced people in a few ways. 

1. Trump says something crazy and the headline tells us it means he wants to have Liz Cheney murdered. But anyone alarmed by that will seek the actual video and find his actual words less explicit and more nuanced. This killed the credibility of media and legit calls for him as a liar and corrupt were not believed. 

2. A desire for a horse race and people to be glued to what will happen next meant sane washing trump to make him more palatable while scrutinizing Harris to make her less. I’m not convinced this was meant to change the outcome but I do think they wanted this to feel uncertain so people would watch. Should we spend this panel discussion on the merits of policy or what the polls mean? Clearly they chose prognosticating rather than informing. 

3. Wild misinformation spreads fast, is hard to tamp down, and impossible to correct universally. People get exposed to a crazy lie and even if they doubt it just sort of say “that’s crazy”. At least some of that firehose of misinformation will be believed. And the right is just better and more willing to do this. 

I do think democrats have lots of room for improvement.

Fourth, the Morena party has implemented massive expansions to the welfare state in the past 6 years under AMLO that have been pretty effective at making people happy despite inflation.

I look at my early 20's son and think damn, he's got a problem.  Starter homes here with a 90-minute commute are approaching 500k which is almost double what it was in 2019, his current apartment is $1700 a month (up about 33%), your typical well-used car is like double 2019 pricing (7k to 15k), and a trip to the grocery is $100 for not much food.

I'm getting angry just typing all that -- and I voted for Harris because I felt she would be less damaging.  But it doesn't change the underlying facts that we (the people) are getting effed by the mega-corps and donor class and the Democrats barely pay lip-service to it and continously under-deliver on even that.

">Blank slates like that are basically going to absorb the easiest and simplest rhetoric there is, and that's always authoritarian type stuff. 

I disagree here. I think we can't say that because the dominant reality of history is authoritarian. That's the environment people are in and that's the overwhelming power they're facing. There's so much pressure against the natural inclination people have toward freedom that they adapt to the contrary.

There's a reason authoritarian systems are inherently contradictory. They need to turn your natural desire for personal will into submission.

Children are blank slates. They all are impulsively freedom oriented til we beat it out of them.

Democratic society itself is an internal war between domination and freedom. It's a philosophical desire by existing power structures to make people submissive and people trying to counter it or accept it and join it to secure their freedom through a piece of the system of domination. . That's actually the thrust of civilization itself.

You need to teach people to be racist. They don't know that automatically. We have in group our group tendencies but they always drive toward hating the out group to protect the in group. That's the lever of authoritarianism.

Generally research shows only about a third of society is inclined to authoritarianism. The rest are taught passivity or some kind of maladaption to submission. Otherwise democratic society wouldn't be possible I think and fascism always rises against the inclination of people to accept it. If they just wanted to accept it it would be easier to make it happen instead of requiring the progressive small step ratcheting.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

The most mainstream modern American fascists ignore ethnicity and instead focus on individuals and family lines - it's still centered on superiority and state enforcement of social hierarchy but it generally ignores race.  They are very similar also in that American and German fascism both consider the Enlightenment as humanity's greatest mistake; Humanism and Democracy are the the ultimate enemies that must be destroyed in their eyes.

Pretty wonkish I know.  But the US won't become Nazi Germany because the ideology behind these movements is different.

"They didn’t choose. Russia hacked the vote..

From the image:

Gov. of Pennsylvania J. Shapiro, et. al.
Nov. 7th 2024

This is a formal Duty to Warn Letter. Per DNI Dir. Clapper’s 2015 directive to all agencies and contractors associated with intelligence and financial agency technologies. I have a Duty to Warn of suspicions of hacking, and have done so for my customers including Govt. Agencies, Dept. of Defense, F100 firms and numerous banks. I do so here as a directly affected voter.

Nearly all my investigations begin for one of two reasons. The hackers make a mistake triggering a system issue and/or the aggregate effects of the hacking creates results outside nominal expectations. There is a third and less common flag; an unrelated distraction to draw attention away from the hacking.

All three of these indicators are present in the election of Nov. 5th 2024. Element three, distraction via bomb-threats, is confirmed coming from Russian agencies. Element one is the inexplicable mismatch of reported votes vs. voter turnout. Here in Centre County initial tabulation was an absurdly low 67K votes when over 80K voters participated. Element two is also present. Our local scanner systems worked in testing, but were unable to communicate properly with tabulation systems after the bomb-scare. I note from experience - the failure of a scanning systems to properly load a database is an extremely common development when a system is changed without notice to the users. I have personally worked on similar issues where sudden scanner configuration failures were the first symptoms of system hacking.

With these three elements present, I suggest immediately doing a relatively simple set of preliminary checks. First, randomly selected precincts require manual comparisons of the number of voters who took ballots vs the scanned output of vote totals. Those did not match here in Centre County by apx 13K votes. Once added, those votes substantially changed outcomes and led to the outright reversals in multiple Centre County races.

Centre County BOE now shows vote totals over 80K votes. Apx. 6% above 2020 turnout. In my professional opinion every county in PA as well as many in WI, MI and GA currently reporting lower vote totals vs. 2020 and/or also experienced a distraction bomb threat should undertake the same process My professional opinion is: many thousands of voters are being disenfranchised, likely by a malicious actor via errors in tabulation software. My concern has been proven correct and warranted here in Centre County PA.

The US Constitution does not explicitly prohibit gender inequality or sex-based discrimination, unlike 85% of UN member states. 

The US government has also refused to recognize the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) as the 28th Amendment, which would explicitly prohibit sex discrimination.

Women are underrepresented in politics.

Pay gap: Women’s median hourly earnings are consistently lower than men’s

Child marriage: Child marriage is legal in 37 US states, and at least 300,000 minors were legally married between 2000 and 2018. 

Reproductive rights: The US has violated the human rights of pregnant women and girls by denying them access to safe and legal abortion.

Gender equality in the workplace: Women’s representation in employment has remained above 50% since 2008, but there are barriers to advancement to higher levels

1. Many Americans’ #1 identity is being a Christian; the Repubs appeal to the largest parts of this demographic in prose, policy, and platform. Say what you will about “true Christians” (I probably agree with you), but the reality is the GOP own the majority of the Christian-vote. 

2. Repub’s message is “you’re amazing and this other group that isn’t you hates you and drags you down. Let’s fight them” while the Dem message is “we all have work to do to improve ourselves. We need to reflect, be humble, and think about others. Let’s fight the baser parts of our nature.” The Republican message is easier to swallow. 

3. Some right-leaning voters actually are racist and sexist and DO NOT want the politicians nor the politics of Democrats because they DO NOT want non-White Male leaders. The Left makes the mistake of painting all/most right-leaning voters as this…but it is absolutely a fact that some are. 

4. The GOP has gone further right while the Dems have mostly stayed where they’ve been for the last 30 years. The GOP establishment resisted Trump until they realized their voters liked him more than them; the Dem establishment hasn’t stopped resisting the further-Left figures and policies. As a result: the Right’s voters are comprised of a big number of traditionally non-voters who are recently energized and mobilized AND traditional-voters who hold their nose while voting for their party. However, the Left’s voters are just the traditional-voters holding their nose. In 2008, Obama’s campaign inspired a huge number of new-voters. In 2020 the reaction against Trump inspired a huge number. But, in 2016 and 2024 the Left’s voters were mostly traditional-voters.

Secondly, because the Democratic party either can't unify around socioeconomic reform or doesn't have the political power to enact it convincingly. Sooner or later, you're going to get punished by people who are struggling, or people who feel threatened by how the economy is evolving.

Get in your car and drive through a rural part of America in any state, off the highway.

There are aging houses, many in disrepair, very few jobs, and no living wage jobs. You might find a dollar store, gas station, and if you’re lucky a supermarket. There are few doctors; hospitals and clinics are shuttering. The schools and public services are underfunded as there is a very limited tax base.

When democrats say the economy is great, who is it great for? Those in full-time, white collar jobs in tech, professional fields, doctors, lawyers, partners in accounting firms. It’s great if you have a 401K. It’s great if you own a home in a suburban or urban area.

For all the red areas of the country, the economy is terrible. It’s bleak and getting worse. People feel left behind and ignored. They want to burn down the status quo. Trump won because we’re not addressing severe inequalities in income and quality of life between thriving urban centers and college towns and dying rural areas.

The gap between the haves and have nots is so bleak that Trump even expanded his base to include additional suburban voters and minority voters living in urban areas.

Trump won all the people that can’t afford basic necessities and see little hope for a better future under the status quo.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

>While Harris was stuck defending the Biden economy, and hobbled by lingering anger over inflation, attacking Big Business allowed her to go on the offense. Then, quite suddenly, this strain of populism disappeared. One Biden aide told me that Harris steered away from such hard-edged messaging at the urging of her brother-in-law, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer. (West did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) To win the support of CEOs, Harris jettisoned a strong argument that deflected attention from one of her weakest issues.

For years we lived in fear of telling the world how we felt because if we were honest you came after our jobs and our ability to pay our mortgages and feed our families.
For years we were forced to tolerate your blatant racism, sexism and intolerance.
For years you called us scum, deplorable, racist (when it was you all along) and for years you called us NAZIS!!! Disparaging the memory of all who suffered at the hands of actual Nazis.
You burned our cities, assaulted our police. 
You told us our religion was garbage.
You repeatedly attacked our values.
You were merciless, full of hate and violent when it pleased you. 
Now, the majority of the nation has spoken and a landslide had taken place.
Instead of performing some introspect and re-examining your hate and intolerance you double down and spew more lies (SO many lies) and hate and fear mongering.
We are saddened but not surprised. People who wrap themselves in the blanket of arrogance do these types of things.
While we, the people are really sick and tired of your shit, and your hate, and your lies and your hypocrisy... we will still extend an olive branch.

Not true: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nbc-news-exit-poll-voters-express-concern-democracy-economy-rcna178602:

On ""Which issue mattered most in deciding how you voted?"", ""Democracy"" was the answer for 56% of Harris voters and only 12% of Trump voters.

From https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/exit-polls-2024-election/, among people for which the most important issue in their vote was ""The state of democracy"", Harris won 80-18.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"“Biden stole the election.”

MSM had their chance to tear this lie to shreds 2 months ago when Trump went on a podcast and admitted he lose the 2020 election “by a whisker.” 

It was enough of a shock to his former supporter, Fuentes, who went on a TIRADE live on his podcast about Trump betraying his supporters and pushing the “stop the steal” insurrection that led to a thousand people getting arrested. 

I mean, I don’t even care about someone like Fuentes except that he represented a typical Trump follower who had a meltdown when Trump admitted he lost the election and had been lying all this time. 

CNN, after years of covering the “Big Lie,” reported on this story ONCE. One fucking time.

There were a few online articles from other media outlets for a few days, then the story was just GONE. No one was talking about it even though it happened so close to the election. Why did everyone bury the story? 

IMO, had MSM should’ve blasted coverage like they do with far less important stories, Trump would’ve started hemorrhaging support and his whole con would unravel.

He would’ve also blown up his entire defense in the insurrection case, because he knowingly made false statements about election fraud cuz he knew he lost the election. So this admission was also him incriminating himself.

I guess CNN and other MSM wanted to keep the monster they created, after 8 years of sanewashing him, burying the ONE story that was proof he had been lying to his supporters this whole time.

If it’s not about him and how he can enrich himself and exact revenge, he’ll just sleep through it. He’s nearly a decade older than when he had to start doing this job the first time around.

|[A: Allegiance to the United States.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/section-147.3)|The willingness to safeguard classified information is in doubt if there is any reason to suspect an individual's allegiance to the United States.|
|[B: Foreign influence.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/section-147.4)|Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.|
|[C: Foreign preference.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/section-147.5)|When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.|
|[D: Sexual behavior.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/section-147.6)|Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.|
|[E: Personal conduct.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/section-147.7)|Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.|
|[F: Financial considerations.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/section-147.8)|An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.|
|[G: Alcohol consumption.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/section-147.9)|Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.|
|[H: Drug involvement.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/section-147.10)|Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.|

|[J: Criminal conduct.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/section-147.12)|A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.|
|[K: Security violations.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/section-147.13)|Noncompliance with security regulations raises doubt about an individual's trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to safeguard classified information.|
|[L: Outside activities.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/section-147.14)|Involvement in certain types of outside employment or activities is of security concern if it poses a conflict with an individual's security responsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information.|
|[M: Misuse of Information Technology Systems.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/section-147.15)|Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about an individual's trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to properly protect classified systems, networks, and information.|

No, what he meant by that was *""American Oligarchs are seen as weak""*

They didn't have a tight yoke around their citizenry. They couldn't assassinate citizens with impunity. They couldn't bury journalists reporting on their corruption. They couldn't overtly buy laws or bribe politicians. 

Russia wanted to do away with anyone in our government not in support of this vision for America, as we were a major geopolitical road block. He couldn't win against us with soldiers and missiles, but he could with bribes, kompromat, and psyops campaigns.

But don't take my word for it, Russia said as much:

>Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States and Canada to fuel instability and separatism against neoliberal globalist Western hegemony, such as, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"" to create severe backlash against the rotten political state of affairs in the current present-day system of the United States and Canada. Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social, and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"".

[x] Provoke anti-black racists

[x] create severe backlash against the 'rotten political state of affairs in the current day system' 

[x] encourage all kinds of separatism in ethnic, social, and racial conflicts

[x] support all dissident movements, thus destabilizing the internal political processes in the usa

"If you actually read the article, it says that people who were previously voting Democratic voted uncommitted or didn’t vote, which is very different than voting for Trump. The article does not even definitively say that it knows these votes came from Arab-Americans. They are guessing based on counties.

>Just over 100,000 uncommitted ballots were cast in Michigan’s 2024 Democratic primary – about 13.2% of the vote. The greatest number came from Wayne County, the most populous in the state and home to many Arab Americans living in Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, Hamtramck and the surrounding areas. In the previous three campaign cycles, just about 2% of voters choose uncommitted.

So maybe calm down on joking about people getting deported or their relatives getting bombed because they “supported someone against their own interests” because that’s not even what this says.

"Harris’s unwavering support for Israel during the “war” in Gaza was a critical miscalculation. In Pennsylvania, 34% of voters would have been more likely to support her with an arms embargo, with similar figures in Georgia (39%) and Arizona (35%)—while only 7%, 5%, and 5% were less likely. By ignoring this clear path to victory, she lost crucial young, Muslim, and undecided voters.

Not even considering Michigan, this stance could have given Harris a net gain of 900k votes in PA (19 EVs), 864k in GA (16 EVs), and 350k in AZ (11 EVs)—adding 46 electoral votes and bringing her total to 272 vs. 226. This costly oversight was avoidable.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Totally agree, and this is scary. What I’m about to say below is not directed toward you but toward those who voted for Trump to punish the Democrats for the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Personally, I wish the Arab-American community had done more to support Harris. The last time Trump was in office, he made it pretty clear that he doesn’t like them and doesn’t want any more of them in this country. I realize they’re upset with Biden, but they’re about to get a refresher on what it means to be Muslim under Donald Trump. Unlike them, I remember what it was like, and now he’s going to *remind* them.

“But Harris and Biden support Israel and their war that has killed 40,000 civilians in Gaza,” someone will say. Yes, they do, and of the two (viable) candidates running for president, Harris was the only one who bothered to say that Israel is not entitled to indiscriminately kill civilians when hunting Hamas. She’s the only (viable) candidate who even came *close* to empathizing with the innocent victims of this war and criticized the heavy-handed actions taken by Israel.

No matter how you slice it, one of the two candidates is better for Palestinian civilians, and that candidate’s name is NOT Donald Trump, so spare me the arguments about how the Democrats needed to be taught a lesson while they were trying to walk a fine line (between pissing off supporters of Israel and supporters of Palestinians, both of whom Harris needed for victory); the lesson will be learned by the *civilians* in Palestine, and the people teaching the lesson (*some* left-wing voters in Michigan) will be responsible for that. Own your vote, and own the consequences of that vote.

It’s almost as if some people can’t imagine a world where Palestinians suffer even more than they are right now. Well, they won’t have to imagine it, because Trump and Netanyahu are going to put it right on their screens in full color. We’re all going to have to witness the unbridled carnage Netanyahu will unleash now that he has the full-throated endorsement of Trump, an equally-corrupt man who actually *likes* old Bibi.

Anyway, that’s the reality. Don’t tell me about third-party candidates, neoliberalism, or any other nonsense that belongs in an academic setting right now because the *reality on the fucking ground* is that Trump doesn’t like Muslims or Arabs in general, and he’s going to allow Netanyahu to do whatever he pleases. The end.

“But Biden let Netanyahu do whatever he pleased, too,” someone will say. Spare me; I’ve heard it all before and your comments are going to fall on deaf ears. You and I will soon find out how much worse it can get—we will soon see if Netanyahu has been holding back to avoid upsetting Biden—and then you can tell me how you feel.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"I really disliked how soft Biden was on Netanyahu. The core problem was that so much of the conflict is in the back room held up in negotiations between different parties like Qatar, Hamas, Egypt etc.. It definitely seemed like Biden and Netanyahu hate each other, and Biden may have done more than he was publicly saying, such as forcing Israel to provide power and water to Gaza. 

Moreover Israel factors into the US’s Middle East strategy, and its anti Iran stances. If you withhold weapons or signal a decline in support, this will embolden others like Iran or Hezbollah to attack and make it worse. In the end it didn’t matter, Iran and Hezbollah attacked anyway and the war escalated into Lebanon. The Biden Admin may have prevented the conflict from getting substantially worse, but in the end it only got credit for making it worse.

The problem was he was in a position to make a decision, and it was hard to go in either direction. Trump could just say very little and promise the world to people, but he didn’t have to make a decision.

Afghanistan is under Taliban rule right now because Trump negotiated with terrorists. Not only that, but he *didn’t negotiate with the Afghan government.* Then when the Taliban broke the rules of Trump’s agreement, he did nothing. This allowed the Taliban to rapidly gain the upper hand.

In terms of the Middle East, he’s self-described as the most “Pro-Israel President in history.” He sabotaged the Iran nuclear deal, killed an Iranian leader, and set relations back decades. Then he put out a painfully one-sided “two-state solution” and moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. To top it all off, he gave $8 billion in weapons to the Saudis when Congress said not to.

"Article:

Former Fox News host and Trump ally Tucker Carlson claimed Senate Republicans are staging “a coup” against Donald Trump as three Senators vie to replace Mitch McConnell.

Republicans reclaimed control of the Senate on Tuesday night, leaving the door open for someone to replace McConnell, the chamber’s longest-serving party leader, who plans to step down at year’s end.

At least three Republicans are vying for the top spot — John Cornyn of Texas, Rick Scott of Florida, and John Thune of South Dakota who serves as the Senate minority whip — NBC News reported, and Carlson took issue with two of them.

“What the hell is going on in the US Senate?” Carlson posted on X on Saturday afternoon. After Trump won, “Mitch McConnell engineers a coup against his agenda by calling early leadership elections in the Senate. Two of the three candidates hate Trump and what he ran on.”

The former Fox host took particular issue with Cornyn, whom he summarized as “an angry liberal whose politics are indistinguishable from Liz Cheney’s.” Cheney is a former Republican Congresswoman from Wyoming turned Trump critic; she campaigned for Kamala Harris. A Punchbowl News reporter described this comparison as “completely off base.”

The election will take place on Wednesday, November 13. “It will determine whether or not the new administration succeeds,” Carlson wrote. “Rick Scott of Florida is the only candidate who agrees with Donald Trump. Call your senator and demand a public endorsement of Rick Scott. Don’t let McConnell get away with it again.”

Earlier on Saturday, Scott outlined that he was running for the leadership position to “upend the status quo & make sure President Trump’s agenda gets done.”

Senators Ron Johnson, Rand Paul and Bill Hagerty also announced Saturday that they would back the Florida Senator in the race.

Back in February, after McConnell announced he would be stepping down at the end of the year, Donald Trump Jr also labeled Thune and Cornyn as “RINOs,” or Republicans in name only.

The president-elect’s son wrote: “Both of them also voted to send billions more to Ukraine. MAGA must do everything in our power to stop either of these two RINOs from ever becoming Senate Leader!”

Trump also previously slammed Cornyn after he successfully negotiated bipartisan gun safety legislation, claiming the Texas Senator facilitated “the first step in the movement to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY.”

On Friday, the National Association for Gun Rights also issued a statement against Cornyn: “The arch traitor John Cornyn is being floated as the next Senate Majority Leader. This absolutely cannot be allowed to happen.”

“All of the momentum we have gained for gun rights could hit a wall if the man who spearheaded the largest gun control bill in decades is in charge,” the group said.

Although he faced a barrage of criticism from his own party for backing this bill, he stood by his work, telling the Texas Tribune in 2022: “This was fundamentally important to the country at a time when things are so polarized and people are so intolerant of others that have different points of view.”

Missouri Senator Josh Hawley backed Cornyn, telling Fox News in a statement: “I know he will work closely and effectively with President Trump to deliver on the promise of our new majority. I’m delighted to give him my support.”

Heritage Action, the sister organization of the Heritage Foundation which is responsible for Project 2025, provided scorecards for Senators ranked by how conservative they’ve voted. Senator Scott scored 92 per cent, compared to Senator Thune with 37 per cent and Senator Thune with 35 per cent.

Meanwhile, the South Dakota Senator told CNBC on Thursday that while he understood that Trump could “exert a considerable amount of influence” on the Senate leadership race, “my preference would be, and I think it’s probably in his best interest, to stay out of that.” He continued: “These Senate secret ballot elections are probably best left to senators, and he’s got to work with all of us when it’s all said and done.”

Thune received the support of Oklahoma Senator Markwayne Mullin, according to Punchbowl News.

Trump has yet to publicly endorse any of the three contenders.

While sources told Axios that Trump privately brushed off Scott’s bid as “not serious,” a Trump spokesperson refuted that claim, telling the outlet that the former president “hasn’t weighed in on the leadership race and anyone who says differently is wrong.”",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"Somehow, Mitch McConnel's parting gift of an early Senate Leadership vote is the last thing that may give America a chance to stifle the implementation of Project 2025. I won't be having any hopes, though: Trump was able to sink a bipartisan immigration bill while not being in any sort of office. Now that Trump is the president-elect, Rick Scott will most likely secure the role. I'd be surprised if he doesn't.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"This is a good example of why the American pro-democracy coalition would be smart to ease up on the ""all is lost, last free elections"" discourse.

Podcast bros and Heritage conservatives generally do not want the same things (except for control over women), and the manosphere types seem like they could be broken off with some strategic messaging. Even among the billionaire class, the tecnho-feudalists and the old school big business types are not aligned.

I understand the ""democracy is doomed"" moment now because people are mourning. But as a long-time expat who has worked in policy in a couple other countries and has a comparative perspective, there are still so many guardrails. Please use them!!!! Minority parties in Congress have power, not every case can come up to SCOTUS and some circuits still have majorities of non-fedsoc judges, and most of all, y'all have one of the most decentralized systems in the world that prevent takeover in a single swoop.

Some states run themselves much differently than the federal government and frequently have ballot measures or amendments to solidify these differences but other states do not have these and mirror the federal government in more ways than not. When you include the territories and the indigenous nations you have something like 60 different levels of difference and how government is run and the policies they take, compared to any given time period of federal governance.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"I spent the lead up to the election trying to genuinely understand what the conservatives in my orbit saw in Trump and how they were arriving at their conclusion that he is best for America. Approaching this with curiosity and non-judgment, it became pretty clear to me that there were several things that were true to them and conclusions they were arriving at through what I perceived to be a convoluted kind of logic. 

1. *All politicians lie*. They believe fundamentally that all politicians are serial liars, including Trump (e.g., “you can’t take him literally”, “he’s never going to actually do that”). But here’s the rub: they can at least figure Trump out. It’s clear he’s a bullshitter, they know it, but he’s batting for their team. Harris, on the other hand, struck them as a true politician—one who will say whatever is necessary to win votes, regardless of the lie. Clinton was similar in their eyes, and yes, you can’t divorce the fact that they’re also women. 

2. *Trump is more authentic*. He “says it like it is” even if the “like it is” is complete, nonsensical bullshit. They know it, but again, at least they can parse it. Spend any time in rural America, and you’ll see bullshitting opinions is the great American pastime. And, they get that. The mental leap they make from here though is that this all actually makes Trump the more authentic candidate. Basically, “we don’t know exactly how Kamala is lying to us but we know she is” whereas the other guy is bullshitting us but we’re used to that kind of lying (look at how they excuse anything crazy Trump says with “he didn’t mean it that way” or “you’re taking him out of context”). Then wrap all this in overt and unconscious biases and you have a recipe for how to arrive at who is trustworthy. 

3. In this set of mental gymnastics, Trump is seen as the more trustworthy candidate, stemming from their perception of his authenticity. Yeah, they know he’s bullshitting them, but their intuition has led them to believe they understand Trump’s intent (e.g., Make America Great Again) so the semantics of whether or not he is actually being truthful about anything specific is of little concern. They trust him because he’s authentic, and they can’t (or don’t want to put in the effort to) parse where a candidate like Harris might be telling the truth versus lying. So, they dismiss it all and never look back. They’ve been spurned by politicians in the past so it’s just easier to go with the guy they see as authentic. 

Couple all this with the most massive disinformation campaign I’ve ever seen on X and other social media and you have the recipe for Trump getting elected. It all feels very logical to them, and they can’t understand why we don’t see it like they do. In their world, they have no clue why anyone would vote for Kamala Harris and why the left sees her as more trustworthy than Donald Trump (ergo, the left must just be batshit crazy!) They are two completely different heuristics, and the result of one of them has almost certainly set fire to American democracy.

The GOP has consistently not only alienated but actively targeted everyone who isn’t a straight white male. 

Why did only these men vote in their best interest and no other demographic? 

I can understand level of self hatred in some minorities but Harris seemingly lost votes from almost all demographics even when issues not only relevant to them but can be completely life altering (deportation, abortion ban) were on the ballot.

Even if you don’t want women to die from not being able to access healthcare, you chose to vote for the people who are the reason why women ARE dying from not being able to access healthcare.

No matter what moral high ground you’re trying to stand on today, these are all choices YOU made. (By “you,” I mean Trump voters, not “you” as in the person I’m replying to. You’re not so Terrible, Jared.)

Choices have consequences. Those consequences include people judging you for the choices you made.

It’s perfectly fair for people to cut you out of their lives based on these choices you made. They and others they love will be directly affected by these choices you made. They feel betrayed by you. They thought you were better than this, but you chose the empty promise of a few extra bucks over their safety and well-being.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

They have a pathological adhesive (or addiction) to denialism of being incorrect, so much so that some become vehemently belligerent in opposition to that being revealed.

"Democrats keep thinking that elections are about policy positions, and that if we debunk the GOP’s arguments for policy positions we can win them over.

They aren’t and we can’t. It’s about vibes, and Trump’s vibe of “the system has failed you and I will tear it all down” is more compelling than what expensive DNC consultants and their focus groups can come up with. Consultants and establishment Democrats keep moving us to the right, as if Americans vote for Trump because of policy.

Trump is a right-wing authoritarian populist. To be competitive we need a progressive populist, because this is the only way to hit the same vibe while also not abandoning polices that we have traditionally supported. The establishment hates this because principle comes at the expense of billionaire donors.

But, for all of the grief he’s gotten, Bernie Sanders’ ability to get massive support despite a huge establishment disadvantage is proof to the contrary.

I see political hacks go on CNN and say things like “Kamala lost because she supported Medicare for All and the Green New Deal in 2020.” No, in fact most American voters were completely unaware of her past stances because *they don’t care about policy*. They just know their lives are worse and are trying to make sense of it.

They react well to Trump because, although he protects billionaires by blaming liberals and immigrants, he approximates a dissatisfaction that they also feel. Progressive populism will address that same dissatisfaction *while also accurately blaming our woes on the billionaire class*.

The good news is that they’re going to run JD Vance in 2028. He’s a soulless, animatronic goon and comes off as such. He’ll be the incumbent after a disastrous four years.

While Americans are scratching their heads trying to figure out why they are not more prosperous, the nation is divided, and the economy is flailing - well, it's not rocket science. Educate the masses, provide good healthcare for everyone, and provide equal opportunity for all people to grow, succeed, and contribute, guess what? The entire nation prospers.  
  
Lastly, building skyscrapers doesn't make you a good leader of the people. It makes you someone that can build skyscrapers.

If two sides are agree on the problem and argue about the solution, we can make progress. When we can’t agree on the problem, when we have fundamentally different views of reality, we can’t. If both sides agree that man made climate change is a threat, one side might propose mandating green energy while the other side suggests cap and trade, and people can argue about which will work better. 

Now we live in two different realities. One where Portand has been burnt down, Haitians are roasting people’s cats and caravans of illegal immigrants buy up all the houses and bring illegal guns into the country where Biden’s spending on Ukraine and woke nonsense has caused eggs to be unaffordable. And one where Portland is fine, Hatian refugees are normal people, house prices have gone up due to a number of factors including covid pricing of materials and rampant investment, illegal guns come from America into other countries, Ukraine spends most of the money we give them on buying our old weapons from us, and eggs are expensive due to avian flu and price fixing, but have come down in price significantly since their peak. 

Our realities are fundamentally incompatible. And this won’t get solved by us arguing about what reality is. We all have to agree on some basic facts about the world and that doesn’t seem like it’s going to happen any time soon.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

The policies are not the problem. It's the name-calling and messaging where they lose. Dems **do not** need to moderate to improve their appeal, the exit polling and sentiment polling continue to validate this repeatedly today. They need to raise the volume on their branding and messaging in ways that move the needle. 

Granted, they don't know how to do that, but the policies, frankly, don't matter. If policy positions mattered, then the GOP would take away from EVERY ELECTION CYCLE, that they are too extreme for the American people. They know moderating isn't necessary to win elections, they don't win on policy, and 2024 proves that in spades.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.” -Jean-Paul Sartre

"As much as it feels good to know the truth behind the smoke, we need to focus on getting the truth out to the people who ""thought"" these tax cuts will benefit them. Let's figure out how to tell the average American the truth:

""Massive tax cuts for billionaires generally conflict with traditional conservative values of fiscal responsibility and fair market competition. While presented as economic stimulus, these cuts often increase the national debt and shift the tax burden to the middle class. Average Americans end up facing reduced public services, higher local taxes, and increased costs for basics like education and healthcare. This goes against core conservative principles of balanced budgets, community investment, and equal opportunity. True conservative values typically support broad-based tax relief that helps working families and small businesses, while maintaining essential services and fiscal responsibility. Instead of benefiting the economy as claimed, large tax cuts for billionaires often create unfair market advantages, hurt local communities, and force state and local governments to either raise taxes or cut important services to make up for lost revenue. This approach ultimately weakens the middle class, which conservatives traditionally view as the backbone of American society and economic growth.""

I've spent my entire adult like supporting government that aims to look after the impoverished, the less powerful, and the disadvantaged.

I never asked for or needed a thank you, but I did expect that when offered the choice between a helping hand or a leader committed to making their lives miserable, they'd choose the helping hand.  I guess that was asking too much.

I expect that my life will be severely impacted by all of this.  I will have less freedom, less money, less time, less of everything, all because millions of voters were made at Biden for a bunch of shit that was largely out of his control.  Fuck those people.

NPR has a show called Marketplace.  It's a business piece, covering current and interesting money trends.  A couple a weeks ago this subject came up.  Experts weighed in in this possibility.  This inevitability.  The result is very bad.

Kiss your 401k goodbye.  Markets will crash, shift, and reallocate.  A forced recession, unemployment spikes and interest rates spike, and there is a massive loss in confidence in the US as the safe currency.  The US loses in this fight, China probably wins.

Hyperinflation spikes. Government debt and fed funny money printing goes up to create an illusion until it can't.  Another great recession is brewing.

"Washington has needed overhauling for 50 years, it is this giant self serving bureaucracy, the reserve is far to close to wall Street, the only thing propping up the value of the USD is its global reserve status, nicely being undone by BRICS, most non western countries would be delighted not to trade in USD.

If this gathers momentum, it will create a flight away from the US dollar collapsing the US economy & taking all the other Western economies with it.

The banks will just hedge into other currencies & asset classes, but it will destroy the value of US pensions & create hyper inflation.

Wall Street & the federal reserve have been playing chicken with the US economy for years, printing money when it suits them & creating inflation.

They added 20% to the US money supply during Covid & gave $9 billion to Blackrock to buy US stocks.
Normal people are still dealing with the effects of the 20% inflation.

I'm glad the new administration is interfering with the sacred institutional cows. They have been rorting the US tax payers for decades.

"I don’t know what to tell you. Elon was at his rallies, jumping around and talking about cutting more money from the federal discretionary budget than there is in the entire federal budget. We don’t live in a rules biggest world anymore. I’m not gonna call Trump a Nazi. I’m not gonna call him a fascist. But we’re in for a realignment of American politics as we know it and the old rules do not apply anymore. So it’s quite possible that Elon Musk is going to be hanging out the White House whispering to Trump and helping him make very terrible decisions on behalf of the American government and there’s not a damn thing to do about it.

There’s not gonna be any women’s marches that are going to move the needle this time. The entire MSNBC grift operation that was the “resistance“ that gave rise to a whole bunch of nice Substack subscriptions and Patreon subscriptions aren’t going to move the needle. This is uncharted territory. They have the authority of a landslide election behind them and probably a trifecta of American government. And this time there isn’t going to be “establishment Republicans“ to help keep him in check. 

The best thing we could possibly hope is that Trump checks out for four years and plays golf as much as possible. And hopefully we don’t get hit with another global crisis like we did the last time.

"I think it's time we stop pretending people give a shit about things when they are struggling. They wanted a nationalist populist who will change it all, and that's who was voted for. 

Everyone keeps bringing up grocery prices, but what about housing? Childcare? Healthcare? Jobs paying almost nothing more? The complete lack of ability to train up to a new job without a massive monetary investment? 

That is ALL democrats should have been talking about, but they had to glaze over them because Biden was in power at the time and as far as your average American is concerned, he wasn't doing shit about it. Blame Joe Manchin, but at the end of the day republicans played that one perfectly. 

Everything else was completely stupid to focus on. As sad as it is, the vast majority of americans don't care about LGBTQ issues. Most people don't care about the Gaza Vs Israeli war. Ukraine was a fun one to rally around at first, but after a few months? Not a care in the world. Not when rent is 1600 and you keep shoveling billions over to Israel and Ukraine instead of finding some way to take that earmarked military budget and improve American lives instead. 

Then there was the golden child of the abortion issue. Everyone thought FOR SURE this was the nail to the trump coffin. Turns out, most people don't give a shit about this either. At least not enough to pick it over economy. Ask them what they think and of course they will outrage about people dying trying to find an ER that will abort and they absolutely think women should have a right to choose. They will rant all day about it. Behind the scenes though? only around 25% of women get an abortion in their lifetimes, and a lot of them live in a blue state or a red state that passed protections. Combine those abortion rates with the women not living in abortion banned states, and you have over 75% of people who ""*won't happen to me!*"" and have far more pressing things to worry about, like having a kid of their own when it's near impossible to pay for raising one. Meanwhile Trump is pulling the ""I'm kinda pro abortion so don't worry about it"" for those freaking out that it might get banned federally. 

Trump won because most of his chaotic ramblings were about the economy. About how bad things are. And despite record numbers across the board, most people still see the economy as a clusterfuck and will of course blame the current admin even though this is all leftover from the pandemic and trump giving his buddies a massive tax cut. **In the end, this doesn't matter at all.** All he did was talk about ways of fixing this. The one thing our greedy little lizard brains want. *""Get rid of immigrants! Remember when 1 million people died during the pandemic and wages spiked because companies couldn't find anyone to hire? Imagine 11 million!""* Or ""We will drill ALL the oil, fuck climate change!"". This shit sounds good to the majority of americans, like it or not.

"My city has a $1.07B public school budget for about 22,729 students. That’s $47,000 per student! The average rate of proficiency for math and ELA tests for third through eighth graders hovers around 15%. The cost per student in high performing  affluent suburban schools is about half that.

My kids went to an inner city Catholic school. The tuition was about 1/4 per student of what we are paying for city schools students. The parents of a lot of the kids were city school teachers. About half the kids were Catholic.

My kids got an excellent education and did very well in college. Both have great jobs and are top performers.

It’s inhumane to trap city kids in violent, poor performing city schools. Let parents send kids to the school of their choice.

I paid school tax plus private school tuition. I’m not rich; we sacrificed to send our kids to Catholic school.

Something is shaking up. In some of the hip-hop/pop culture blogs i visit, the vibe feels more maga than ever before. A couple of things i take away are that more people are buying into why MAGA buys into Trump, the perceptions that he means good and means business. His strength & bravado.

Seriously though, this is probably the biggest reason why I'm skeptical that Trump is going to get much done, despite having all 3 branches of government behind him. I think there's 2 big camps in the GOP right now and the weird, edgy, more libertarian aligned weed smoking crypto-bros aren't necessarily looking for the same thing as the traditional hyper-religious part of the camp who wants the ten commandments to be in schools and for abortion to continue to be illegal (the NELK boys definitely aren't going to church every Sunday). 

I think he's going to start to struggle pretty quickly with keeping both sides happy but his incessant need to be liked also isn't going to allow him to prioritize one over the other. How do you balance the Joe Rogan side that likes weed, porn, partying, and hates ""woke"" stuff and the side that abhors drugs, porn (at least on the surface), and wants to live a 1950s nuclear family life style?

"These people are stupid and mindless with not an ounce of intelligence when it comes down to the science and sociology behind LGBT people. Im not even a scientist, but as someone whos apart of this community, i made the choice to understand all of it better. 

Gender is a social construct. It's no different than respecting a person's name or title. Sure, we have sexual organs that we've classified into two sexes, male and female, but we made those terms and used them to describe stuff. But there are surgeries and hormones that can be taken to at least change the outside of a person's gender identity. Obsessing over the biological sex of someone is fucking dumb and pointless. No one is magically changing their sex nor do they have to, to be a guy or a woman. Mention that intersex people exist to a conservative and watch their mind implode as they try to justify their blatant transphobia.

As far as everyone else goes, diverse sexuality is common in many species outside of humans, penguins, lions, giraffes, etc. And there's a ton of science and theories and different factors that explain why it's like that. In penguins same sex couples will often adopt the babies of other penguins that have rejected them. Ultimately contributing to the preservation of their species. Sounds familiar with what some gay human couples do no? At least in spaces where they can adopt that is.

There's also the fact that some children, while in the womb, can be exposed to different chemicals that affect sexuality. There's a higher chance of having a Queer kid with every child a mother has. That's just the biological part of it. Our unique experiences, upbringing, and exposure to new and different things can also contribute to forming our identity, which in turn forms our sexuality. At the end of the day, it's natural, and it's a part of nature to be the way we are. 

Conservatives and fascists could eradicate every LGBTQ person on Earth, and yet it still wouldn't erase us because more and more LGBTQ people would be born every day regardless of what they do. It's impossible to stop it without a mass extinction of the human race. You can take away our rights, our knowledge, and science, but they can never take away our constant existence.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

I personally view gender more like a term describing which sex you identify as (and there are only two sexes). E.g. a trans woman’s gender is ‘woman’. 

I don’t view ‘intersex’ as an actual sex or gender, but rather a term to express that the sex of a person cannot be properly defined. Similarly, I don’t view e.g. non-binary, gender-fluid, etc., as ‘genders’.

"I've wondered about the consequences of a bipartisan election system and the motivations that cause individuals to vote. If there were multiple parties representing multiple value priorities, we may see a representation of population interests. However, in a bipartisan environment, i think we either vote because we truly support someone or because we despise ""the other"".  
Democrats didn't lose because they supported the LGBTQ+ community, they lost because they kept insulting, denigrating, and shaming men. ""Toxic masculinity"" is a fully open phrase in the academic environment where Gen Z is raised, where young boys and young men have to deal with the unopposed attacks on their being (something they were born as, like the color of their skin). Only recently, has it become acceptable to ""change"" your ""assigned at birth"" gender. I don't think most people change their gender because it's how they feel they SHOULD be, i think they do it because it's the only way to feel accepted, at an age where social acceptance as social animals is everything.  
It's easy to blame racists, bigots, sexists, misogynists, etc for the reason why democrats lost - because it avoids all accountability. If the democratic party were to really look at their behaviors - they would see that in the search for ideological and moral supremacy, they've put down a majority of the population as being scum, lesser, and whose opinions have ruled the world for so long it's now time for them to sit down (when none of these men have ever held any kinds of positions of authority).   
If the democrats ever want to win, they need to learn to embrace everyone and stop scapegoating their toxic behaviors against strawmen racists, bigots, etc.  
As a moderate, what I see is a party of entitled bigots masquerading their values as moral superiority. The republican party is actually connecting with the majority of the people, and just because the democrats can't see it - they will blame it on the small percent of the assholes in the population and use them as representatives of the whole.

"There's a lot of confusion and misrepresentation about what trans people want exactly, which makes it tricky. Here's a list of what does and doesn't matter to me politically, as a trans person:

Important:

* Being able to continue to access healthcare \[stopping HRT after you've been taking it a long time is medically dangerous\]
* Not facing violence \[Many of us have experienced violence for being trans, and hope not to again\]
* Not facing discrimination at work \[Many of us have experienced this too\].
* Getting our ID in order. \[The majority of trans people in the US don't have matching names on their ID, because state-level barriers often prevent some of them from being changed. This causes a slew of administrative problems in our lives and prevents us from accessing numerous services, both public and private\]

Not so important to us:

* School sports is a nothing-burger. For 12 years, I've almost never seen anyone mention it in the trans community as a problem in their life; it's the problems above that everyone worries about.
* Having everyone like us and understand us. The reality is that a lot of people don't understand transness, and some may never. And that's OK. One can't force others to like them, nor force them to support their community. All we do ask is to be respected and treated fairly even if you don't actively 'get it'.
* Triggering people. This is a strange one, but I've sometimes heard the accusation that trans people's goal is to go around 'looking strange' in public so that we can provoke and upset people. But in reality we're just trying to be ourselves, and feel ourselves.

Don't get baited into it, because the ""hard"" questions are rage-bait traps and impossible-to-answer, and the most good-faith questions are usually just still steeped in ignorance at best. 

Instead, candidates need to pivot. ""You know where I stand on this issue. Check my website. I'm campaigning to talk about issues that most people are interested in hearing, and that's the economy, healthcare, and climate."" Or whatever, some version of that that has been focus grouped or whatever, the point is, spending TV time and radio time getting lost in the weeds on an issue such as trans people isn't going to win an election. It just isn't. Trans people aren't helped when you get lost in the weeds and produce little sound bites to take out of context for the right to hammer home and then we lose elections. 

This is not to say we throw trans people under the bus. We *must* support all people. Trans rights are easy to write strong support of on your platform. It's not like international conflict where it is messier to commit to a specific side. But you don't want to spend valuable airtime talking about it much, because it just isn't an issue to *win on.* Trans people are not confused about which party is more or less likely to support people who want to murder them.

I’m all for human-rights for trans people. But trans-rights are starting to become synonymous with insanity-rights and woke-rights.

The average cost of gender confirmation surgeries is  [$25,000-$75,000](https://www.thehrcfoundation.org/professional-resources/are-transgender-inclusive-health-insurance-benefits-expensive). The reason for the range, is because different people get different procedures, including facial and vocal reconstruction surgeries, which most people don't get. Let's say top and bottom surgery, and consider that the US government wouldn't go with the most expensive option and say $50,000, which is probably high, but whatever. Assuming transgender people make up 1% of prisoners (a high estimate), that would mean 12,300 transgender inmates. The total costs for giving them all top and bottom surgery would be, $615,000,000. Which is about .009% of the [US $6.75 trillion dollar budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_federal_budget) this year.

Trump gained about 50k more votes than Biden had in PA but overall she had 10 million less people vote for her than Biden in 2020 while Trump stayed the same, so I'm not sure how you can say she lost Biden voters to Trump on a large scale. If losing votes to Trump was really an issue, for Trump's numbers to stay the same, he would have had to lose votes somewhere else himself. So what's the logic, she went too far left and he courted moderates at the expense of his extremist base, despite running the exact same campaign as he did last election?

We got it - him winning the Presidency would do more for gay rights than him saying it on a public stage. 

The issue is the Dems need to make trans rights a non issue. Have a common sense talking point that appeals to the middle - trans community should have all the rights as other Americans, be respected for their choice, let the sporting federations decide on trans policies for individual sports and children should not have access to sex changes. Done.

Instead the Dems are afraid to say anything so the Republicans get to define them on this issue. Why? Because Dems are held to a litmus test by the far far left who care more about ideological posturing than pragmatism to get someone on their side into the White House.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Ha sorry about that.  Was not directed at you personally.  I went off on a little rant there.

On your point about economy.  If people perceive their expenses have gone up, it is very difficult to disabuse them of that notion.  They are out there buying has and groceries every week and you are a rich politician who gets someone to buy that stuff and/or us not impacted much.

Also, Republicans own the economy.  Don't ask me why.  Their policies now have no resemblence to old school fiscal conservancy or even Reagan Supply Side any more.  But they are just always seen as better on the economy bar a Great Depression.  It also obviously tends to favor the party not in power that allegedly screwed it up.

Lastly, when progressives say to talk about the economy, they usually mean talk about Socialism.  Taxing the rich, stuff like that.  When middle America wants to talk economics, they mean Why are my gas and eggs so expensive?  And of course if you liberal you are putting safety standards on eggs and doing climate change stuff that is perceived as raising prices on staples.

So there were considerable headwinds.  It was not going to be easy.   Nonetheless Harris had to figure out a plan and go with it.  She did not, and talked in broad terms and said both a lot and not enough.  

And on the culture stuff and trans.  Yeah, you can't go too far on a limb.  My thing is that there might be an issue I want you to go 200 miles left.  But I know maybe you only want to go 100 miles left.  And I know, realistically that you will only be allowed to go 1 foot left.  And you can only publicly mention going 3 inches left.  So just give me that.  Mention some positive vibes for trans in passing, and I am good.

You have many constituents who have different priorities and different positions.  You gotta pick a path and trust that your voters understand the political landscape and trust you will do what you can.  And the Dems did not manage this well.

And my rant was simply, if you are a big trans right person, or a big Socialist class warfare person then maybe Harris is not the candidate for you, and maybe not Trump.  Do what you need to do.  Some voters are just not reachable and no use trying.

Just don't be the person protesting on college campuses hounding Dens to take a hard stance on Israel, protesting the convention, etc.  And then Wednesday morning be like, ""Hey, why didn't she talk about the economy?""  It seemed the protestors went way harder at the Democratic Convention than the GOP.  So maybe Trump could talk more about the economy because he didn't have protestors at his own convention demanding he address an international issue.

That Israel-Hamas issue killed Harris.  It was a real third rail topic where no matter what you said it was going to piss off one side far going against them and the other side far not going enough.  And then far left people after forcing her to commit political suicide were like ""Welp.  Both sides bad.  Plus no economy.  I'm out.""  If you were the one demanding she address your issue, then don't slam her for not talking about some other issue.  She can't do both at once.

Mainstream Dems had issues too. Like for a week everyone was doing ""weird"" memes.  Hey maybe meme about the economy if that's important?

Anyway yeah.  It's over.  Democrats lost.  As a Donocrat, that sucks.  But now we have to just figure out a way to unite, and a better platform and message going forward and stop finger pointing at each other and blaming Harris for everything because it's just continuing to pull Democrats in every direction still.  We can make their job easier.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"You keep citing shifts among demographics but that's not an accurate representation since you're using percentage of votes instead of raw numbers when the argument is about overall voter turnout. 

In 2020, Latinos made up 13% of the total vote share (~155 million votes total), with the split being 65/33 Dem/Rep. Given the total number of votes, that's about 13 million Latino votes for Biden and about 6.7 million votes for Trump. 

In 2024, Latinos made up about 12% of the total vote share (~145 million total votes), with the split being 46/52 Dem/Rep. But because the total number of votes was less than 2020, the numbers come out to 8 million votes for Harris and about 9 million votes for Trump. 

Trump gained about 2 million votes from Harris but that's still 3 million Latinos who didn't bother showing up at all that had voted Dem in 2020. By raw numbers, Harris lost more Latinos to people staying home than she did to Trump. 

You can do the same thing with Asians, they made up 4% of the votes in 2020 with a 63/36 Dem/Rep split, meaning about 3.9 million Asians voted Biden while 2.2 million Asians voted Trump. In 2024, they made up 3% of the total vote with a 39/54 split, meaning 1.7 million Asians voted Harris while 2.3 million Asians voted Trump. Again, he gained about 100k votes from Dems in 2024 compared to 2020, but Harris lost over 2 million votes to people just not showing up. 

By the raw numbers, voters refusing to show up for her was a much bigger issue than her losing votes to Trump. They wouldn't need to worry about finding more white women if they didn't lose millions of minority voters to apathy. Do you think they stayed home because she was too far left, while also for whatever reason refusing to vote for the candidate that was to her right? Or maybe did they stay home because she abandoned her base by trying to outflank Trump from the right on things like immigration? Ffs the Dems were using Trump's hypocrisy for tanking the border bill as a selling point for their platform, do you think any of the 3 million Latinos who stayed home might have been rubbed the wrong way by that?

"I’m someone who knows how to swim but isn’t very skilled at it. If I were to compete, I would likely lose to even a less experienced female swimmer—cisgender or transgender. Does this mean women should compete against men for that reason alone? I’ve shared my view: you can support trans women competing against cis women based on valid arguments for inclusivity. However, pretending that trans women do not have any biological advantage on average is one reason some people disagree; it’s a denial of reality.

Let me be clear: I’m not naming anyone specifically, but there are examples where athletes, who were average in their category before transitioning, became top performers afterward. Why does this happen? Of course, it’s not a universal outcome—some athletes remain average or see only modest improvement—but there is still a clear advantage. Whether inclusivity is more important than this advantage is up for debate.

Does ignoring material reality make it go away? I don’t think so. For instance, Michael Phelps, although with having physical advantages, he competes in the appropriate category; do you agree he has? But when a trans athlete, with all the physiological advantages of their body (including hormone treatments), competes against someone without that, there is an obvious advantage.  Again, one could argue it’s fair in the name of inclusivity, and I respect that and I think there are some arguments for that. Yet, denying that there’s an advantage is part of why some right-wing voices are gaining traction, even among former left-wing or undecided.

Consider someone who was ranked around 400th before transitioning and then dramatically improves afterward. It’s unlikely that the transition itself magically transformed their abilities. Similarly, an average volleyball player becoming one of the best female players after transitioning—especially later in life—points to more than just personal growth. This isn't to say we should reject inclusivity, but denying these realities is no different than supporting unproven treatments like chloroquine or ivermectin simply because of political alignment.

I know I will be downvoted (reddit is an echo chamber) and that doesn’t bother me. What does concern me is that many refuse to even consider the possibility that they could be mistaken. I try to keep an open mind, even if it means I might be wrong—maybe even here. But ignoring reality ultimately alienates people from the cause itself.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"From the article:



CLARK COUNTY, Indiana — Southern Indiana election officials have repeated a well-publicized blunder from the 2022 general election. 

Over 4,000 ballots from three precincts in Clark County were not included in the county's first batch of unofficial election results posted Wednesday morning.

"I’m getting tired of all these people saying that we shouldn’t do anything just because republicans cried foul last time and we got after them about it. 

This is DIFFERENT. They talked about machines stealing votes. Dead people voting. 

Our argument is that they simply DID NOT COUNT ALL THE VOTES

In Pennsylvania, had Kamala received 55 more votes per city she would have won. FIFTY FIVE! And that’s an average. 

If one county finds say, IDK, 4000 on a flash drive that didn’t count somewhere then that eliminates the need for EVERY city to have 55. This is getting crazy and the democrats all need to get on board to confirming this by a hand recount in every swing state. This is not crying voter fraud. This is asking that every vote actually be counted because it’s clear they weren’t all counted!

EDIT: Seems we aren’t the only ones who think this. Kamala Harris has started a recount project:

"Ok so not from 🇺🇸so didn’t vote in your elections. 

Working from the position that Trump held about the same amount of votes as he did in 2020, but something like 16 to 18,000,000 Democratic vote support didn’t materialise, does that mean that potentially 16 to 18,000,000 votes are missing? Or they just simply didn’t show up and vote. 

The letter is of course possible, there’s a lot of misinformation and fake actors etc muddying up the truth, and if anything the election was more about a war of disinformation, but, isn’t that many people not showing up is highly suspicious given such things as abortion and Supreme Court and Civil War talk were all on the agenda.  More than disturbing if that many people didn’t show up.

Or, or the other possibility which only occurred to me watching Trump in the final weeks, was that he didn’t care. He didn’t give a shit. He was acting like it’s in the bag because he knew it’s in the bag. Given that they tried very very hard to cheat and fraud the country of the election result last time, isn’t it just possible that they found a way to do that successfully, and more importantly not spill the beans before it happened. Is potentially away that they made 16 or so million votes disappear in the voting process?

"Honestly if you step back and look at the incentives to cheat, combined with Trump's past behavior, the probability that they worked to rig this election in their favor is high.

Consider:

Trump, Musk = facing imprisonment if Trump loses (Musk stated this publicly with Tucker Carlson)

Putin = facing defeat in Ukraine if Trump loses

Trump = attempted to cheat, stage a coup last election

....

**They all have one common thread = they will lose EVERYTHING if Trump lost this election.**

....

We saw record turnout at Harris rallies, all reputable pollsters had Harris winning by a reasonable margin.

....

Election Day/Eve: 20 million Democratic voters disappear into the ether with no explanation. Swing states that were projected Harris magically go Trump, even when the down ballot wins were all Blue. Russia calls in bomb threats in those swing states where Trump magically won. Trump is on record stating ""I already have the votes"" in the days prior to the election, and ""Mike Johnson and I have a secret to win"".

....

Given all of the above, I have zero reason to trust these results as they stand. We need to RECOUNT all swing states to confirm these vote totals are in fact legitimate. It is not a ""conspiracy theory"" to demand we get a confirmation that these results were in fact legitimate.

For example, how many people at the voting places left when they heard about bomb threats on the location? How many in other places left lines when that start hitting the news that multiple places had bomb threats on them? How many people were scared off when people were going around assaulting election officials and voters? How many people simply couldn't vote when they went in because they found out their state purged their registration? How many votes were ""lost"" when this clearly fairly common issue of sudden issues with voting machine memory sticks overwriting previous results rather than adding to them? Or how all these states that went trump were somehow done counting millions of votes within an hour or two after polls closed, one of the first being florida which has the third most number of ec votes.

Not to mention how trump leading up to election day kept telling his people they didn't have to vote, he already won.

The list of shit this election goes on and on and fucking on yet somehow over 10 million less people voted for harris and about the same number of people voted for trump in what is clamed to be the highest turnout election yet.

AP is reporting 99%. Currently it;'s 2,661,056 Trump vs 2,544,281 Harris. Meaning about 55k votes left, not enough to flip it.

* Pennsylvania:

Same 99%. 3,510,848 vs 3,364,180 (T vs H). About 70k votes left, also not enough to flip.

* Michigan:

99%. 2,804,647 vs 2,724,029. 56k votes left, not enough.

* Wisconsin:

99%. 1,697,298 vs 1,667,881. 40k votes left. Technically enough to flip, but Harris needs to win the outstanding votes by an 88% margin which I suppose AP has deemed 'incredibly unlikely' to have called the state, given where the votes left to be counted remain.

"They were 100% projecting.  In fact, I would bet money on the entire republicans crying election fraud thing they were screaming about being a new version of the two Santas initiative intended to make it so that when they actually committed a full-blown electoral fraud to win that the Democrats couldn’t do anything without looking like hypocrites.

In fact, they have blatantly admitted that that was their plan all along with the whole election fraud claims thing on the Republican side.  

They were shouting and making a big deal about election fraud while themselves openly admitting that they had plans to commit election fraud in order to win. In fact, we watched their efforts to do that, and if you look at the numbers, their voter purges worked.

They had already filed petitions to question the election results before the election even got underway, just in case their efforts failed. This was a clear and concerted effort to ensure a GOP victory by any means necessary.

However, if it is found that fraud did in fact occur, or that ballots were simply not counted or thrown out or purged illegally, which we know they were in quite a few cases.  If it is found that this occurred at a large enough scale that it actually tipped the election results, particularly in swing states, then I believe that we at bare minimum will need a hand recount in swing states and affected counties and other states where enough discrepancies occurred to warrant questioning of the voter count.  This recount would include the ballots that were tossed for “signature issues” among other reasons.

In fact, I wonder if as many people as they claim actually stayed home or if mail in and early ballots were just not counted.

Anyone whose ballot is not accounted for who requested a mail-in ballot or who registered for early voting and whose ballot has been “lost” should be allowed to resubmit their vote.

I mean, the GOP has been crying election fraud for years. We should make sure it didn’t happen right?

And the best way to do that is a hand recount, as well as a full check on and run a full scan of the voting machines to check for irregularities and potential issues with the code related to tabulation of votes.  After all, it’s already shown to be an issue in a few counties we should make sure it’s not more widespread.

This is about election integrity, and making sure that every single voters voice is heard, and that fraud is countered if it has occurred.

Of course, if it is found that these issues were widespread due to intentional interference then we would have to find out who was responsible and prosecute them for their crimes regardless of who they and what party they belong to.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Agreed.

We need a hand recount and investigation into the missing ballots.  The ballots that are actually missing this time.

Every voice needs to be heard.

Also, I think a second investigation should be opened into the electoral betting,and whether it had an impact on the incentive to manipulate the US 2024 election and who was involved and profited from it.

If it turns out the electoral betting had a direct impact and incentive to manipulate and or alter the US election, then we ban betting on elections in the US and look into who profited from it.

As for the rest after that well, we will hopefully deal with them in accordance to all the US laws that apply to such a situation.

"The issue is it’s happening in more places than just this very red county.  Regardless of who the votes are cast for the issue is getting to be far too widespread to be overlooked.

I agree about overhauling our elections to be more fair and account for “missing” votes and ensuring everyone’s vote is counted.

Our election processes need to be overhauled so that every vote is accounted for and added to the voter tally.  Also the ability to purge voters needed to be completely restricted if not removed except for outstanding circumstances with oversight over a decade ago.  Unfortunately, that didn’t happen.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"Exactly.

I’m glad you brought up the betting on the election being legal this year because if you look at who won really big based on electoral betting, it is very telling.  Betting on the election should never have been made legal because by making it legal and turning an election into a financial opportunity, you open the floodgates for financial incentives to commit voter manipulation and fraud in an election.

Or to put it very simply, there was more financial incentive to manipulate and alter the electoral results than there was to have a fair and free election.  Time and time again it has been proven that when you have a financial incentive to make a huge amount of money for doing something illegal,  there are plenty of people who are willing to take the risk for the cash.


Everything else you posted is also spot on. 

Only time will tell how bad things really were and are in relation to the 2024 election.

What can be done right now is people need to report issues with their ballots that occurred.  They need to report their ballots being lost, not counted, discarded, missing, purged, whatever happened to their ballot to make it so that their votes did not count. They need to report it.

Anybody who was involved with the software or voting machines or polling areas on election day if they saw anything that could have impacted the vote count they need to report that too.

Because every single vote needs to be counted, and for that to happen, there needs to be an investigation into why that did not occur.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"The fact of the matter is that in this thread and multiple other posts over the past week we have had people saying that their votes are not being counted or are missing.

In the past few days, there have been multiple reports of discrepancies in voter ballots.  This includes a case in Massachusetts, where the Attorney General is investigating the unusual amount of ballot shortages on election day.  There is also a case in Michigan, where it was found that a few thousand votes were accidentally not counted due to an error with the voting machine.  This actually changed the result of a county seat in Michigan.

You have the cases in Nevada, where peoples mail-in and early vote ballots are being or have been discarded because the signatures they put on the ballot don’t match the signature on file from the DMV.  Interestingly, the primary age group of the ballots being tossed is Gen Z.

There is also the case in indiana, where yet again we have ballot discrepancies that results in ballots being found that somehow weren’t counted.

Not to mention all of the people who ballots are still not counted, or have gone, missing, or disappeared entirely as if they never existed.

As the weeks go on, I fully expect more and more stories about these discrepancies to keep popping up.

You have the voter rolls being culled right before an election, primarily in swing states.  This purge was challenged and ended up going to the Supreme Court, which caused the overturning of a law in Virginia by the Supreme Court that allowed the purges to continue, despite the fact that they are still illegal under the federal constitution of the United States of America.  Also, that Supreme Court ruling is illegal under the constitution of the United States of America.

This is all public record. You can look it up if you wish.  In fact, a lot of the stories I mentioned are linked in this sub Reddit.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

- Whatever method they used wasn’t set up to work on mail in ballots. Maybe it’s only through compromised machines?

- They had everything set up to rig 2020, until a once in a century pandemic blasted through and caused everyone to vote through the mail.

- Despite them rigging it, they lost to the tsunami of mail in ballots, which infuriated Trump. So he started screaming about the Democrats must have rigged it.

- Come 2024 and they have everything set. Which is why many seemed so confident in him winning despite his campaign and rallies being weak.

I do not subscribe to this BlueAnon thing going around, although I do not want to simply 'trust' the process either. The results defy not just electoral logic, but common sense: Trump has spent his campaign insulting black people, black immigrants, latin immigrants, and I find it mind-boggling to believe that so many of the same people he insulted broke for him.  Were we just in a media bubble where the awful Puerto Rico joke from one of his campaign surrogates mattered more than it actually did? Because it was a big 'last straw' for Puerto Rican celebrities (and you think their uproar would make uninvolved voters aware), even the Puerto Rico GOP threatened to withhold the endorsement. And that was supposed to be the gaffe that would deliver Pennsylvania for the Dems!

The choice here is to either accept that people are comically uninformed, to a point of throwing away their lives in a ""Jews for Hitler"" moment because eggs and gas rose in price and they're the good ones so they have nothing to fear; or to indulge in a conspiracy that they did turn out, but were heavily disenfranchised not only by law and poll placement, but at the polls themselves.

>They were shouting and making a big deal about election fraud while themselves openly admitting that they had plans to commit election fraud in order to win. In fact, we watched their efforts to do that, and if you look at the numbers, their voter purges worked.

Voter disenfranchisement is definitely real. But media is to blame as well: the races should not have been called as quickly as they were. If the election was called at the same point in 2020, that would be a Trump victory. And I don't mean to say that Kamala has a chance to swing this election, no. But last time it came down to razor-thin margins in a select few swing states, sometimes in the range of 10,000-15,000 votes. So why the hell did they call the election on election night and the Harriss campaign condeded the following morning?! There were hundreds of thousands votes left to be counted!

This is in part what fueled the grave-digging by the media and online commentators, proclaiming the Democratic party to be dead, unviable and its coalition shattered. This wasn't a blowout loss, as the votes keep getting counted we see that the margins stabilize within a pretty narrow range of 1-2% – so we're looking at an expected inverse of 2020. There was a Republican-leaning national environment this time, but it can be explained by economic frustration. The string of democratic overperfomance had to end eventually, even if we all wished that it would outlast Trumpism.

>...then I believe that we at bare minimum will need a hand recount in swing states and affected counties and other states where enough discrepancies occurred to warrant questioning of the voter count. This recount would include the ballots that were tossed for “signature issues” among other reasons.

I am sorry, but nothing is going to help us, because this exact thing had already happened in the past, in 2000. Even if Americans find out that democratic ballots were criminally undercounted in, say, Michigan (which had a lot of issues reported this year and had a state seat flip to a democrat after one of them was corrected) to the tune of 50k ballots, and the state government agrees to a recount; Trump's legal team would immediately plead to the SCOTUS to step in. And they will, and they will plainly tell us that even if these ballots were enough to change the outcome of the election in the state, it's too late for recounts therefore the results will stay the same and the Michigan electors will go to Trump.

*""On December 8, the Florida Supreme Court had ordered a statewide recount of all undervotes, over 61,000 ballots that the vote tabulation machines had missed. The Bush campaign immediately asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the decision and halt the recount. Justice Antonin Scalia, contending that all the manual recounts being performed in Florida's counties were illegitimate, urged his colleagues to grant the stay immediately. On December 9, the five conservative justices on the Court granted the stay, with Scalia citing ""irreparable harm"" that could befall Bush, as the recounts would cast ""a needless and unjustified cloud"" over Bush's legitimacy. In a 5–4 per curiam decision, the Court ruled, strictly on equal protection grounds, that the recount be stopped.""*

This was the goal of *the Big Lie*™ all along: the election has been called from Trump, and any evidence to the contrary is 'the steal.' States only go red, never back. Even if it's inconsequential – Michigan's electors alone wouldn't be anough to give Harris a victory, unlike in 2000 where Gore most likely would have won with Florida's electors.

And of course, none of this talk would matter if not for the Republican's favourite: the Electoral College. If Harris somehow won, Trump would become the first Republican presidential hopeful to be the winner of the popular vote but loser of the electoral count, despite a fair lead of over 4 million votes cast for him.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"In Maricopa county, at least, you couldn't just ""swap the sticks.""

Every voter checks in on a site book (big tablet, basically) that is connected to county voter rolls. Then they get a ballot printed, fill it out, and run it through the tabulator. 

At the end of the night, votes are accounted for in three ways.

(1) On a memory stick that the tabulator has been uploading each vote to as it is cast. 

(2) On a receipt that the tabulator prints. At the beginning of the day, it prints each contest with (0) values showing no votes. At the end of the day, it reprints each contest with the actual number of votes cast that day. These receipts are stupid long and have to be signed by the head of the voting site and the bipartisan team of ""judges"".

(3) On the physical ballots, which are saved in a locked bin beneath the tabulator. It drops them in the bin after it reads them. 

At the end of the night, the physical ballot and corresponding receipt are put into a black back which is sealed with a unique numbered zip tie, the number of which is logged. 

The memory card goes into a bag sealed with a tamper evident seal, the number of which is also logged. 

The log also reflects the number of ballots cast--from the check in machine, the paper ballots, the tabulator's digital count.

At the end of the night, a bipartisan team takes all of the above and drives it to the election headquarters where official counts are completed. 

(None of this is about dropped off mail in ballots, which are not tabulated at the poll on election day.)",2024_11_10,06_45_08

It doesn’t matter if you’re in a red state, a blue state, or a purple swing state.

Every single vote must be counted.

Unfortunately based on what we have been seeing over the past week, including personal reports from people on Reddit and verified reports from the news this did not happen.  Every vote was not counted.  Votes are missing, votes are simply not being counted, votes have been purged.  That is the opposite of a fair and free election.

Every vote must be counted.
Every voice must be heard.

If in the end, after every single vote is counted if HE still manages to win, then at least we will know every single voice was heard.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"He was quoted saying that multiple times.  Other members of the GOP verified this as well.

I hope that the DOJ is investigating where those voting machines that Ivanka bought ended up.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"What evidence there is so far are the reports of unusual discrepancies in ballot counts, the numbers and party affiliations that are registered at various counties not matching up with the actual votes that were cast in both number and party vote.

There are ballots being discarded over signatures in Nevada but only for certain demographics; and the multitude of ever growing reports of peoples ballots simply not being counted or disappearing entirely.

Another issue is we don’t know if the percentages being recorded and sent in by counties and states were actually accurate, especially considering all of the reports of peoples ballots not being counted at all.  Apparently, quite a few counties decided to just call their county without finishing counting all the votes.


I believe I listed the one in Michigan, where they found that the machine had tabulated things wrong, and as a result had lost a few thousand votes. This actually impacted a local county seat.

You have the voter purges that occurred before the election as well.  In fact, there were many cases of people attempting to register after being purged and being rejected over and over again, despite being resident and citizens of the states and area they were voting in.

This is without getting into the voter manipulation, tactics, electoral bribery, and all the other shenanigans that occurred in the lead up to election day.  Don’t forget the bomb threats on Election Day,  and the various voter harassment and intimidation that occurred at polling sites.

If you want to see the news stories about many of these cases, you can look in this subreddit.

However, I will mention again that we will know more as time goes on and more reports come in.

The one thing I have been pushing for most and telling people to do is that if their vote was lost, not counted, purged, discarded, or has gone missing to contact the FEC, relevant federal bodies, as well as any other organizations and file reports so that it is on file that their vote is missing.  Also, to be loud about the fact that their vote is not being counted.

Because every vote should be counted.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

[US election experts worry about Republican poll watchers in swing states](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/be-aggressive-republican-poll-watchers-battleground-states-worry-us-election-2024-10-24/)

> “Be aggressive,” Jim Womack, a local Republican Party chair in North Carolina, told the grid of faces who joined the Zoom training session for volunteers to monitor voting on Nov. 5. “The more assertive and aggressive you are in watching and reporting, the better the quality of the election.”

> Womack, 69, an army veteran and a retired information systems engineer, instructed 40 volunteers on how to spot “nefarious activity.” He mentioned a local clergyman who accompanied dozens of Latino parishioners to a voting site “like a shepherd leading a sheep.”

> NCEIT addressed noncitizen voting in two planning calls, according to the transcripts obtained by Reuters. In July, a participant raised the subject of how to spot an “illegal” and suggested that a person who can’t speak English probably doesn’t have the right to vote.

> One participant in an NCEIT planning call in May said she makes signs for polling locations in different languages, including in “African,” stating only U.S. citizens can vote. She called her signs “psyop,” shorthand for psychological operations aimed at influencing people’s behavior.

[The GOP drive to install thousands of poll workers sets off alarms](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/politics/gop-poll-workers-recruitment-ctzn/index.html)

> For decades, the RNC also was shut out from so-called “ballot security” work under a federal consent decree after the national party targeted Black and Latino voters in New Jersey. The party’s operation — carried out during a 1981 gubernatorial election — included posting armed, off-duty law enforcement officers at polling places in heavily minority communities. The consent decree ended in 2018.

> GOP officials say they are now free to lead a multimillion-dollar electioneering effort that includes adding 16 state “election integrity” directors and 26 in-state lawyers, along with recruiting more than 14,000 poll workers and adding upwards of 10,000 poll watchers across the country.

> “Being a poll worker, you just have so many more rights and things you can do to stop something than [as] a poll challenger,” said Matthew Seifried, the RNC’s election integrity director for Michigan, stressing the importance of obtaining official designations as poll workers in a meeting with GOP activists in Wayne County last Nov. 6.

> “Remember, guys, we’re trying to build out a nationwide district attorney network. Your local district attorney, as we always say, is more powerful than your congressman,” Griffin said during a Sept. 21 meeting. “They’re the ones that can seat a grand jury. They’re the ones that can start an investigation, issue subpoenas, make sure that records are retained, etc.,” he said

> Before sharing a slide on “How to Challenge a Voter,” Seifried outlined a series of scenarios under which recruits could contest voters or voting processes, though he cautioned it is illegal to challenge every vote.

> In an October meeting, Seifried said priority targets are Detroit, Pontiac and Southfield, which are heavily Democratic and minority areas. “Those are the ones that we need to focus all our efforts on,” he said.

> “Ideally, you guys will all be the election inspector,” said Seifried. “You have so much more authority because you’re the one that’s actually administering the election.”",2024_11_10,06_45_08

As for the DOJ if they are doing anything, I don’t think they’re gonna be super public about it; especially because there is a chance that documents could be destroyed and evidence lost if they are outspoken about an investigation.

However, I personally believe that every single person whose vote was not counted or whose ballot went “missing” needs to file a report with the federal elections commission (FEC) and any other relevant federal or state organization.  They also need to be loud about their vote not being counted.

"That’s exactly what needs to happen. We need a grassroots organization, people need to band together to demand an investigation into this election because the numbers do not add up.

There are too many missing votes. There are too many lost mail-in and early voter ballots. There are too many ballots being rejected because of signature issues.  There are too many ballots just straight up not being counted. There were too many people purged from the voter rolls right before an election.  There are too many discrepancies between the party affiliation of voters that showed up to vote and the actual tallies in so many counties.  There are far too many technical errors for this to be a normal election.  Even before the election, there were multiple data breaches into multiple government agencies, and even some of the companies involved with the voting machines themselves.

Something is very wrong, and if the Democrats will not admit it, then we must shout it to the heavens until they or the DOJ look into it. 

This is about more than being a Democrat, a Republican, an Independent, or even being a member of one of the super minority parties that never makes it onto the ballot in the first place. This is about the integrity of our elections and the right of every single person in the US to vote and have our vote properly counted and heard.

I expect in the coming weeks more cases of voter discrepancies and ballot issues will appear, but if we do not demand an investigation, nothing will be done.

The deadline is January 6, 2025. That is when the election is certified and ratified.  A few months is not much time, but as we have seen in the past week with the reports coming out concerning issues with ballots in that time, a lot is going to happen in the next few months.  

The only way that we have a chance of ensuring an investigation into all of this electoral skullduggery and shenanigans is to put pressure on our elected officials to do their job as representatives of the people.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"It is not impossible to accuse the GOP.
I refuse to call them Republicans because they have not been Republicans according to recorded history in 40+ years. My late grandfather, the Republicans became the GOP after Nixon and they have just been using the Republican branding ever since.


I say risk being a hypocrite for the sake of the truth and for the integrity of our elections.  Stop playing the game by their rules.  The GOP has been forcing us to play their way for 40+ years.  It is time to flip the proverbial monopoly board and stop playing by the GOP house rules and start playing by the actual rules.

This is not about who individuals themselves voted for, this is not about the party they belong to, this is about making sure that every single person who voted; every single person who filled out a ballot, has their voice properly heard and accurately accounted for.


Every single instance of a problem with this election at every level from ballots going missing or not being counted, to any instances of electoral tampering and hacking must be reported.


It’s time to stop being quiet and start being loud.

If enough people speak up, if enough reports are filed, if enough voices are raised, and enough articles are written something will be done.  
But it has to happen now and it has to happen fast or else it will be too late.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"Indeed.

However the only way to know for sure is for an investigation to be started, and a full hand recount and examination of all of the voting machines to occur.  However, that likely won’t start until after every single vote in every single state is done being counted.

All data is useful,2024_11_10,06_45_08
My understanding is that that was not conducted by the FBI which would be the entity to investigate a U.S. citizen suspected of spying. That was conducted by the special counsel and may have used information from the Stone and Manafort investigations. My sources for this claim is the Mission Implausible podcast discussing whether Trump is a Russian asset. I think it was the second of a two part episode and Pete Struck is a guest.,2024_11_10,06_45_08
"Yes, there is a way and it is completely possible to do on short notice. In fact to double check and make sure that the count is correct you can even hand recount the physical ballots to be sure.  Compare them to the registration numbers from mail in, absentee, early, discarded, and Election Day ballots to ensure that all of them are accounted for. 

You see every single ballot has a number attached to it and that number is attached to the voter.  So any ballot that is missing can be connected to the voter who cast the ballot.  So if it is found out that any ballots are missing or were destroyed or discarded or purged or something happened to it, the original voter can be contacted to resubmit their ballot.

Isn’t that neat?

Also, you are very right to be concerned about the voting machines and whether somebody got into them because of certain data breaches that happened leading up to the election involving the companies that make them.

Thanks to the power of metadata you can actually retrieve lost data on USB sticks because of how they work.  I wouldn’t be surprised if the USB sticks were tampered with during the time they were misplaced.

"President Biden is correct, the policies he passed, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the CHIPS Act, the infrastructure bill, will not be fully recognized for years to come because these are transformative policies that take years to roll out.  

Just one example of a policy that will take effect after President Biden leaves office, was passed through the IRA, where senior citizens’ prescription costs will be capped.  Every single Republican voted No to the IRA, but I can guarantee that President Trump and Republicans will take credit for that when this takes effect in 2025.  

Americans have short term memory. President Biden inherited an unmanaged pandemic that took the lives of over a million Americans. One of the first things he did when taking office was to pass the American Rescue Plan that was instrumental in bringing America back from disaster, sending low- and medium-income Americans $1,400 payment to help fund basic necessities like rent and groceries. And he extended unemployment for Americans who would’ve otherwise lost their homes. But this has all been forgotten. 

President Biden then signed into law the infrastructure bill. For decades, no president has taken on the responsibility for fixing crumbling bridges, railways, roadways, our water system because it was not politically advantageous. Again, these are accomplishments that are not seen for years. It takes a president who has forward thinking who can put into practice transformative policies.  

Then you have someone like President Trump, a bombastic marketer, who knows how to convey a simple message of stoking fear, while sending a simple message of, I alone can fix it. This is easily digestible by the average citizen.

President Biden did not lose this election.  Citizens, who are exhausted by decades of inequality, latched on to a simple message that Trump provided, and they truly believe he alone will fix it. Guaranteed, Trump will be taking credit for some of the above accomplishments.  

President Biden is one of those presidents who will be recognized for how great he is years from now.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Everyone needs to watch this video, if you haven't already. It documents the time between election day 2020, and January 6th. It's not narrated, no bias, only raw footage. It begins with the rise of the ""stop the steal"" movement, the Proud Boys preparing to act on the results of the election, and with Trump's tweets, his Fox News calls, and Alex Jones and his counterparts laying the groundwork for this ""revolution"".


I skipped ahead with the link I shared, so it'll jump right to the January 6th footage.

If one group is offering bogus solutions and the other group is just wincing with a shrug, one of those two groups is going to look ignorant or even malicious.""

They know damn well that the economic elite and corporations are to blame, but they refuse to say that or offer solutions that allude to it. Republican politicians *also* know why shit is so expensive and why things suck so badly, but unlike democrats... They're happy to lie about it. They choose to give bogus answers and even more bogus solutions to placate their voters (because saying ""billionaires are why shit sucks"" is a lot worse when you *are* the billionaires that makes shit suck).

This is one reason why Bernie was effortlessly popular. Not only was he one of the few democrats offering solutions, he was one of the only ones offering solutions based on the *real issue*. He was the most left-leaning politician of most of our lives and went blow-for-blow with Clinton despite having virtually zero of the media/establishment support and coverage that she did. Considering how ignorant most people are about politics, the fact that he got *that* far without being blasted all over the airwaves shows just how passionate people were. If the media sided with him, he'd have dominated - they never would, but the point still stands.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"lmao of course the democrats are bullshit who would've guessed?

the us needs both of its parties gone so a multi-party age can begin. You also need party-list proportional representation to make it easier for those smaller parties to enter the HoR. Also, increase the number of representatives from 435 to 800. A large country like the US needs far more members of congress. Ik the current capitol building won't be enough, so you can make a new building, the white house lawn has plenty of space to make a new congress. Also, remove the undemocratic electoral college and have the popular vote count with a runoff election too. This will ensure the winning candidate has the support of over 50%. also, eliminate midterm elections.

the senate can also have 200 members. 4 senators from each state, they should all be elected every 4 years. also make puerto rico a state and eliminate wyoming & north dakota (fuse it with s dakota and rename it ""dakota"". then make puero rico a state, and split cali in 2. this way you won't have tiny little states having more representatives than they should while millions of people can't even get represented.

also, if you would prefer, you should switch to the parliamentary election, so that the prime minister has the constant backing of parliament. this way, the prime minister cannot abuse their power, because the 800 members of the house of representatives and the 200 senators would have the power to destroy the government.

so yeah, i should totally re-write the US constitution. also, remove the indian reservations. i dont give a shit if they think about it as ""losing their land"", idgaf about what nation lived there a 1000 years ago, they shouldnt be autonamous and should be subject to the same laws as everyone else.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

He won in 2016 mainly because he really was an f you to the elites, billionaires, both parties political machines and donar groups.

what is crazy Dems kinda doubled down on being the big business, wall street, big academia, MIC, elite party since 2016 and even went mroe wall street - Like i never thought I would see Dems advocate for globalism and off shoring Jobs and sighting and embracing Goldman Sacks policies and proudly campaigning with Goldman's endorsement.  I never thought Dems would fight for and being pro illegal immigration, open boarders, and saying it was good to bring in more low skilled cheap labor with these immigrants and having them work jobs for companies instead of americans...like they had adds and interviews with those companies in which management was saying these immigrants work longer and harder than americans and that they prefered to hire the immigrants and would state the wages which while sounded good, you instantly would realize that the wages were under what was average for that position and what they were paying US citizens also many of those jobs were usually down by unions in that region - like that is what Dems where always against.

DNC is a money making machine. their donars are willing to donate to them because if they win, dems will pass policies that help them....if they don't welp republicans policies align with them and their goals anyway so its win win.

DNC realized they can get money and bought by huge donars and industries basically get paid to not be progressive or anti average american and working class.  Dem's liberal and progressive platform is basically a shake down of big money holders - DNC is charging a protection fee.

Republicans are going to be conservative pro business regardless. So the big money has no reason to pay them. 

 Elon saw this and was like yo I got the most valuable car company, an ev company, my supply line is in china, my company does solar and batteries. My other company does rockets and space contracts from nasa and darpa.  I get a ton of money from Gov subsidies and contracts and I am liked by one party mainly, the democrats. My compeitors and rivals are the tech companies, ICE car manufactures, and fossil fuel industry.....after trump won in 2016....he saw the shift in donars and parties and was like hmm Dems are getting bought by the people that don't like me and are probably going to loose these next few cycles I got to hedge politically....so he bought twitter and went right wing and endorsed trump.  there is more too it but Elon hedged and got the political support and power he needed to protect and benefit his companies.

>He did not go hard enough to make sure Trump pays for his crimes thus leaving us with this creep.

The President and the executive branch are not law enforcement. There was no ""hard enough"" for him to go. Unless, of course you are advocating to give the President the power to do in which case, you'll get your wish soon enough. 

Furthermore, every single United States citizen has a right to a fair trial- it's Article 6 of the Constitution. It does not matter if you are the most guilty person in the world, you still have the right to an attorney and a fair trial. Once you remove this, you have precedent to remove it for *everyone*. This should never, EVER, happen and it won't - this is enshrined in the 14th amendment. Without it, you get the end of the Dark Knight Rises.

>He did not expand the court which would have stopped a lot of ridiculous rulings like then presidential immunity at the least.

You can't just ""expand the court""- it requires a bill and a majority vote by Congress.

>And maybe would have saved abortion too for the time being.

There is nothing Joe Biden could have done to stop the Supreme Court from overturning Roe vs Wade. Even if he were to enshrine it as federal law- it would still be subject to be overturned at any time. That's how laws work.

>He did not do enough in Ukraine for e.g expedited Ukraines entry into NATO.

Aside from the billions of dollars in aids and arms, as well as the severe sanctions imposed on Russia - the United States can't just have countries join NATO. The alliance consists of 32 countries, and each must agree to allow the country in. Within those 32 countries, each has their own international diplomacy, risks, and benefits to consider in voting to decide. Some countries are ineligible to join NATO due to pre existing treaties and agreements and memberships. You can't just ""join"" NATO, and the President doesn't get to bring countries in or out.

Certainly, Vladimir Zelensky disagrees with your assessment on Joe Biden's dedication to Ukraine.

>He did not get rid of the filibuster and ram in more democratic legislation.

The President has absolutely no power or say over the filibuster. The only way to get rid of the Senate filibuster is for the Senate to vote to remove it. That's it- it has nothing to do with the executive branch.

>He did not go after Elon Musk hard enough (or at all). This is just to name a few.

Because he can't - we have the 4th and 14th amendment to ensure the protection of private citizens from the government and their right to a fair trial. Are you really advocating that the President should be able to focus the power of the executive branch on individual, private, citizens? Well - you're about to get that. 

You can't just say shit and expect to be taken seriously if you don't understand either the literal structure of the government or the greater implications of what you are advocating for. It's almost extraordinary how ridiculous these critiques are on multiple levels.

>Biden did a lot of good. But will ultimately go down in history as a weak president who helped us along the path to fascism due to what he did not do when he had the chance to.

I am a literal historian- and no, he won't. We can't see the future, nor can we see how it will be viewed as its own history in the even further future but there are patterns that repeat across millennia. It takes generations for a President's legacy to settle because what may seem consequential today will be completely forgotten as time marches on. All the Presidents you think of as ""great"" suffered greater critique and attack and controversy than Joe Biden has, and every one of them was considered to be a historical failure in their lifetime. We forget all that because it's just chaffe, fodder, and political bullshit. What ultimately lasts are the long term effects of their policies.

We can see this happening in real time with Ronald Reagan, who is consistently falling in Presidential rankings as we are seeing the fruits of of his administration- that took almost half a century.

Joe Biden's Presidency will be remembered for huge strides in climate change legislation, an incredible economic recovery from a worldwide crisis, and- if we are lucky- as the one who began to dismantle the disastrous student loan system. If I had to wager, time will settle him in the top third with the potential for the higher end based on climate and student loan forgiveness achieved in one term.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"If we go all the way back to the 1890s-1900s, William Jennings Bryan was the Democratic nominee thrice. 1896, 1900, lost the nomination in 1904 and then got it back again in 1908. He actually got nominated by two parties in 1896, his own  Democratic Party and the Populist Party and he accepted both nominations. He kept losing but they kept choosing him because he was such a charismatic speaker who was extremely popular with the base. 

He was only 36 when he got his first nomination, making him the youngest ever nominee so I guess the party thought he’d eventually win more people over as he got older. He basically invented modern campaigning, being the first to do a national stumping tour which may have been too aggressive in an age of front-porch campaigns. He was one of those guys whose supporters were convinced would go on to do greater things than what he eventually achieved.

Before Jennings, there was Henry Clay back in the first half of the 19th century. Like Jennings he also contested three elections but won none. He ran under the Democratic-Republican Party in 1824 back when there was just one party and party nomination wasn’t a thing yet, the National Republican Party in 1832 and then the Whigs in 1844. He was one of the Immortal Trio or the Great Triumvirate of the Second Party System.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"I *hope* that what is stopping him is is the centrist/moderate republicans (in congress, in the military, and in government in general) that aren’t going to bow to his every wish. That’s what stopped him during his first term, except many of them have been voted out of office since then. Some moderate republicans that I’ve spoken to say “oh he isn’t going to actually do that. There are smart people advising him that won’t let him” any time I bring up something absolutely horrible that he has said or promised, but it’s truly impossible to tell how much power he is actually going to have. 

There’s two ways this could go:

At the absolute best it’s a repeat of his first term: he doesn’t get much done besides tax cuts, it’s chaos in his cabinet, congress is divided and doesn’t get anything done, we see an increase in hate crimes and violence, and we pray that there isn’t another pandemic.

At the absolute worst we may see immigrants being put into camps, which may lead the way to other “enemies” of his being put into camps too: journalists, politicians who oppose him, and eventually other minorities or anyone who disagrees with him. We could also see the war in Ukraine ending with them being forced to cede their land to Russia, which may provoke Russia to start trying to take over more of Europe. Similarly we may see China start a war with Taiwan, Israel expand their war and start invading Lebanon and Iran (if not more) and maybe even North and South Korea breaking their armistice, possibly at the hands of other countries involving them in different wars. If this does break out into a World War III level event then Trump may try to use the fact that it’s wartime as an excuse to stay in power for a third term, and America turns into a modern day Nazi Germany.


Obviously both of these cases are very extreme, and it’ll probably be somewhere in between, but I’d bet money on the fact that his second term will be much worse than his first, and he will solidify himself as the single worst American president (twice if you count Trump 45 and Trump 47 separately)",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Lystrata,2024_11_10,06_45_08
"This movement is part of a larger trend we are seeing playout. Check out most studies and surveys from the last several years when it comes to dating and the general themes that emerge are: women are dating less and are happier being single than men for a variety of reasons including having closer social bonds with other women.

The birth rate in the the United States is back on the decline. It got a small bump during lockdown but that did not last long.

In about 15-20 years, conservative supporters are really going to feel the effects of these laws. As the current voting population ages, they are going to be need medical care more and more while the Healthcare shortage grows. Roughly 80% of Healthcare workers are women. 

[Overturning Roe vs Wade in 2022 has already led to a decline in medical residents avoiding states with restrictive abortions:](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/09/1250057657/medical-residents-starting-avoid-states-abortion-bans)

""The new analysis by the AAMC — exclusively reviewed by KFF Health News before its public release — found that the number of applicants to residency programs in states with near-total abortion bans declined by 4.2% between 2024 and 2023, compared with a 0.6% drop in states where abortion remains legal.""

And then [Nurses United backed Harris ](https://time.com/collection/time100-voices/7015492/nurses-union-endorses-kamala-harris/) because they've been doing much better under the Biden Administration than the Trump. 

Sometimes I think folks are also forgetting that [more than 1 out of 5 Gen Z women identify as bisexual. ](https://news.gallup.com/poll/611864/lgbtq-identification.aspx#:~:text=More%20than%20one%20in%20five%20Gen%20Z%20women%20identify%20as,do%209%25%20of%20millennial%20women.)

So, y'know, plenty of women can also date each other instead of men.

For women who are still interested in dating men and starting families, access to quality healthcare is an important factor. Same with school districts. Mental health resources. Etc.

And yes, I'm aware of how many white women voted for Trump and how Gen Z women didn't show up at the polls. If I had to guess a significant contributing factor for it ties into the above reasons. For older generations of women, it's harder to pick up your life and move.

For younger women, especially those who are college educated, there are a lot more job opportunities available where you can make serious bank if you're willing to move around. Traveling nurses make serious bank. Mental health agencies and hospitals are offering big sign on bonuses for therapists (another field that is largely made up of women),  and charter schools are offering some nice benefits, just to name a few examples.

[One of the few things keeping our population growth stable has been immigration](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2024/07/30/the-political-shockwaves-of-americas-falling-birth-rates-00171799#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20the,US%20population%20at%20replacement%20levels.)

 One it assumes woman don't crave affection and sex like man and dont suffer from the lack of it in the same way so they can easily cut off relationships. It's the idea that men like sex and woman just endure it, it's regressive and honestly kind of stupid.

And second , white woman voted for trump in droves. It's not like this was a massive woman against men election. The only real desproporcional voting block of woman was black woman and they are historically the most democrat block since they were allowed to vote.

*”Imagine being an 18 year old young male voter. When you were 11, the MeToo movement launched and men across the board like you were deemed oppressors. When you were starting high school, liberal politicians closed your school and forced you to take classes online. The women around you don’t seem like victims — they are going to college at way higher rates, earning far more than men in many professional white-collar jobs, and are way less likely to be addicted to drugs and as lonely as most of the guys you know. Your peer group of other young men play video games and enjoy memes mocking the dominant, suffocating, woke culture across all the major entertainment and academic institutions”.*

*Literally, we have nothing, no future prospects, most don’t have skills, most don’t have partners, all for reasons outside of our control*

*All we had was our hobbies, and we couldn’t even be left alone to have that”*

and people wonder why women are doing this? that tweet is a prime example of men blaming everyone else for their problems with almost no introspection or self reflection on their part. they blame women and feminism for why they can’t get a date, they blame immigrants for why they can’t get jobs, etc.

I don't want to risk an ectopic pregnancy in a state where doctors who know how to help me are not allowed to. The only way I can increase my odds of survival is to not date. That takes an accident or a date rape off the table. Already attached women who are concerned might be looking into getting their tubes tied, or their husbands might be looking for a vasectomy. 

It's all simply life-preservng measures. Some people like to be offended about how others live their life though. Which is... how the whole problem started. Why is it anyone's business that some women who walk amongst you are celibate? We aren't out there shooting up malls. We are working, grocery shopping, cooking, walking our dog, we are just living normal and quiet lives.

There's going to be something to pick on regardless of how women choose to live our lives. We should have closed our legs, we shouldn't have worn that, we should have picked better partners, we should have dated less, we should not have had so many kids, we shouldn't have had any kids at all, and now we should be having sex with men.

i’m in college trying to go into a heavily female dominated space of work (9:1 f:m) and i really wish there was something like Women in STEM for me, but there’s not and it’s really rough a lot of the times because i’m never represented in anything and i feel out of place which has led to me wanting to change my major recently",2024_11_10,06_45_08

I can actually see the appeal of that in a way, even if I personally could never live like that. It's essentially authoritarian communism at the micro level. The man is in charge, but everything is taken care of by the patriarch, as long as the rest stay in line.

Women do this, too. Everyone does, it's a human trait.

At the end of the day, we're all human and need to work together. Life isn't a zero sum game. Men's problems need to be address as well. Every time they are brought up, women say what about us. Women have enough outreach programs. Men have zero. If there was some outreach to men, maybe the Democrats would have won.

You can say imagine this, imagine that, but do you think the average person imagines things from another person's perspective? No. They think about their own life, their own perspective, and when young men are being told they are literal monsters they will go towards the side that doesn't vilify them.

We're talking about less than 4% of all relationships.  It was closer to 20% in 2015 so those men aren't going to be impacted by people slamming a door that has already been shut for a decade.

As a personal choice to not have children with anyone, I totally support it.  That's a choice my partner and I made years ago for other reasons and I support it regardless of political affiliation.  But when it's branded as ""B4"" or any other name and it comes with political goals, it stops being an individual choice and becomes collective action.  In that regard it's a horrible strategy.  

It's not a conflict to say that I support something as a personal choice but think it's ridiculous as a protest tactic.

The better tactic would be to explain to young conservative men that women of all affiliations are more likely to be sexually adventurous in a country where they feel safe and have convenient access to birth control and reproductive healthcare.  People of both genders are more likely to take risks when they don't carry longterm penalties.

I've seen many politicians talk about it in terms of doing the right thing, and that argument has persuaded who it will persuade, and it wasn't enough.  I didn't see anyone explain to young men how they will be personally impacted by the issue and the argument ""liberal women will never have sex with you"" probably isn't going to move the needle since that wasn't happening for them anyway.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Even in Japan, where bureaucracy is the national sport, the birthrate wss criticaly low for over ten years before they were aware of the problem.

"What do you have in mind saying that?  It's an interesting train of logic to go down, but can't think of any good quantifiable examples. Border Control getting hamstrung in bureaucratic red tape in the courts, getting slammed with injunctions for every discretionary decision they make in enforcing their mandate? I mean that is how they want it to work for the EPA, what about Homeland Security and Immigration?

...that would be funny.

But that could be an end around to making border enforcement administratively impossible for the Federal Government, and they would push that to the states as well where they would have the widest of legal playing field available and be able to do what the Federal Government has never been able to do because of the Federal Laws that they can't undo legislatively or pass an Amendment to end the Federal Government's sole jurisdiction over the border. It fucking sounds like something this Supreme Court would do.

But that is just off the top of my head. Could be bad, real bad, or it could be good. Really depends on how much time they have in complete control. They have no excuses now. Put up or shut up America said. Trump has 4 years before the end of his second term. Then we get new candidates on both sides. No more incumbency in 2028.

I have heard the argument that only the Confederate Army surrendered. The Confederate Ideology was not ideologically defeated because the CSA wasn't annexed like how other wars are usually settled. Instead Reconstruction occurred. The Rebel States had to adopt constitutional amendments with the Union States along with other conditions to get back into the Union. They believe that since so many generations have passed and the former Rebel States still haven't adopted that same kind of law into their own State Constitutions. Therefore Democracy must reign and the states left to vote for their future unbridled by the past. No more Constitution to protect anyone in states that have no matching language in their state law.,2024_11_10,06_45_08

Trump got what he wanted and in full. He has no allegiance to anyone now. That’s on you. You served your purpose. And because you were willing to sell out your fellow man for ratings (intangible form of value exchange might I add), he already knows, you are not to be trusted. 

To go further, commies like Russians went one step further further and practiced the punishment of decimation to keep everyone on their toes and willing to sell people out. (Eliminating your allies first…Lenin/Trotsky when Stalin came to power)

Rogan is right...he wants to get even.  He doesn't realize that he has another shot at being a great President. He failed badly the first time and if he fails again he will continue his spot at the bottom of the list in Presidents ratings.  He needs to accept the fact that he's also responsible for ALL the people, not just the super wealthy and himself.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Trump is going to screw things up *bigly*, cause a lot more economic pain and needless deaths, while his racist cabinet of oligarchs dismantle the federal government and fill their coffers. But hey, Joe gets his nice, juicy tax cut. 

Trump is a rapist, racist, and conman who is a grenade throw into our Republic by, at this time, the majority of Americas who voted. They want Trump to inflict pain on those they hate, aka CoAsTaL lIBerAl ElItes.

Then the next four years happened, disproving that, and he built enough of a following that he didn't need the moderates anymore.

Now here we are again, only now we know his rhetoric isn't just talk, and the people that like him for economic  reasons still really want that part of his agenda without the christo-fascist parts. Anyone even mildly aware of politics knows what he is like and what he is capable of, and they're really hoping the fascist parts will be able to be ignored in favor of the economic gains that won't happen.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"It is so much worse for a few big reasons.

Number 1: we already know who Trump is and the sort of things he thinks are worth doing. It is conceivable that somebody who voted for him in 2016 didn't know much about him, had never watched The Apprentice (where he came off like a gigantic asshole despite it being his show), just wasn't engaged at all and liked his vague policy promises, which really weren't much. That is no longer the case in 2024. If someone is misinformed about him it's deliberately so.

Number 2: Trump in 2016 ran on MAGA, vague promises of restoring America to its former glory. While that is obvious bullshit, you could construe that as a positive message. In 2020, he ran on continuing that. In 2024 though, he is not running on MAGA anymore. He is running on a revenge platform. He wants to take vengeance on his enemies and has literally said that out loud, repeatedly, to his followers.

Number 3: Anybody who voted for Trump on economic grounds in 2024 is a complete and total idiot unless they are part of the uber rich. In 2016, Trump didn't really have any economic platform. He came in and rode the coattails of Obama's good fiscal policy, and despite having all three wings of govt, he did basically nothing on the economy. He left it alone and removed some restrictions upon companies' activities like dismantling the EPA which, if you don't care about the environment, you could perceive as a good thing for the economy. But the only real major thing he did to directly affect the economy was his tariffs, which were overwhelmingly a bad idea that had bad results. In 2024, tariffs are a HUGE part of his plan, and he wants to put them on EVERYTHING. His economic plan is so bad that mortgage rates have already been shooting up the last 6 weeks since a Trump win became likely, in anticipation that he will bring in fiscal policy that will cause inflation to skyrocket. This is not a point of debate or a ""what if"" scenario -- the only ""if"" is whether or not he actually enacts his economic plan or not. If he does, the US will go into a depression, inflation will shoot higher than it did during COVID, and it will be even worse because it won't be global inflation like during Biden's term -- it'll be specifically in the US and it will cause companies and trading partners to distance themselves from the US more than they already did during his first term.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Suddenly, he couldn't hang out at the comedy store, which I think was a core part of his identity up until then. I think he blames Democrats for keeping him from doing comedy. 

I also think he's very insecure about his masculinity and about being perceived as weak, hence his disdain for masks and covid vaccines. He thinks those things are for weak men who are either afraid or just not strong enough. Then 2024 Trump came along and did a good job branding himself as the candidate for men in the eyes of a lot of idiots, and Joe is a huge idiot so be actually bought into that shit.

"I listened to a black (woman) Trump supporter say that the whole civil rights movement helped to destroy the black family structure and blacks were only being used by the democrats.  She said that black families have been dealing with illegal immigrants since the 1800's and that they (illegal immigrants) have taken away wealth from black families and keeps blacks from fully realizing the American Dream. 

Is this true?  Doesn't matter what the truth is.  When civil rights were made into law, the southern white population shifted political parties.  They became republicans.  That's what I remember.

Okay.  Let's undo everything back to the 1950's.  Everything.  Bring back the ""white only"" signs and put them where they used to be.  Make the back of the bus the black section.  The schools, the theaters, the water fountains.  Let's go back.  

I'm an old white dude.  People look at me and assume that I support Trump.  I don't.  My radar went off when Trump announced in 2015.

"I am far more concerned about why white women, latino men and Asians voted for Trump in such high numbers. 79% of black men and 90% of black women voted for Kamala and the media keeps acting like this is a wonderful accomplishment for Trump. This is still a small proportion of black voters. The fact that Trump doesn't care that the majority of black voters actually voted against him speaks volumes. Trump didn't win the election because black men voted for him. He won the election because white men, white women, Latino men and a significant percentage of the Asian Americans voted for him. We keep holding blacks to a higher standard than everyone else and forget that every race has misogynists. Every race has stupid uninformed people who don't read the news and every race has rich people who just care about not paying taxes. Yet we keep expecting blacks to save the democratic party every time elections come around and when they aren't 90% pro-democrat, they get criticized. Trump has made far more offensive comments about Latinos at most of his rallies  and yet a  large percentage of Latino men voted for him in droves. He made extremely misogynistic comments about women and yet white women were his second highest supporters and chose white privilege over autonomy. I'm still trying to wrap my head around why so many Asians voted for him. That is what we need to focus on more. This country does a very good job of pitting minorities against each other. Whites weren't the ones who won the battle against affirmative action with the supreme court. It was Asians, who are consistently made to think that blacks are taking their spots at colleges, even though most of their spots are lost to white women. We can say that these other groups voted becasue of the ""economy"" but I truly believe that that many non-white groups have been influenced by a lot of the anti-liberal anti-black rhetoric and we need to focus on why this is happening.

"Wages vs inflation. 

https://www.statista.com/statistics/1351276/wage-growth-vs-inflation-us/

I think Biden/Harris message was focused on the blue (wage) line as a strength while voters seemed to focus on the black (inflation ) line. 

A couple of problems with that:

1) wage inflation may not be evenly beneficial while prices of goods inflation affects everyone. For example, if half of people got an 8% raise and half got no raise, that’s 4% wage inflation.  But those with no raise will feel the pinch of increased prices with no corresponding wage increase. 

2) I believe that psychologically people will attribute their raises more to their own abilities (or otherwise to factors other than Harris/Biden) and so they’d still be unhappy about rising prices (disregarding that presidents don’t control prices).  So if someone’s monthly wage goes up by $300 and their costs of goods and services go up by $300 ?or even $200), they’re still in the same relative place, but they will probably feel worse because costs went up (and they feel like they deserve the raise but did not deserve the cost increases).",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Canadian perspective here.  Most of them didn't look beyond any of the surface level stuff they saw pushed by the Trump campaign, Fox News, podcasters and other high profile supporters.  I watched the election coverage on our broadcaster CBC, and they interviewed people at the Trump campaign headquarters, and it looked like those bits you see on late night comedy shows where they go out on the streets.  Those shows probably interview 30 people and then feature the dumbest 5.

So many of these election night Trump supporters painted this picture of Kamala as this weak, dumb person who was too afraid to do any interviews, and Trump was a strong, genius businessman who loves America.  It's not that they didn't agree with a Kamala economic plan.  They didn't know she had one.  They didn't know anything about her, other than the bullshit talking points they repeated.

After every interview, they'd cut back to the CBC desk in Canada, and the panelists always had this look of ""well, that was a wild interview"" on their faces.  Kamala never had a chance, because half the country just wasn't going to listen.

I saw someone comment here last week about being undecided, but they changed their mind when they heard all of this Nazi talk how about the Trump campaign was running.  There were legitimate connections and concerns about the language that was used and the tactics they used to dumb things down.   What was this ""undecided"" person's response to all of that?  He voted for the guy accused of using a Nazi playbook.  ""All of this Nazi talk is just ridiculous. You can't be serious. I'm gonna vote for THAT guy now.""

He didn't listen to what was said about Nazi comparisons.  He just heard the word Nazi and immediately shut it down, and didnt' listen to the arguments.  ""You said the Nazi word. I'm finished here. I'm voting for him now.""",2024_11_10,06_45_08

You can explain policy to someone until you are blue in the face but at the end of the day, inflation happened under Biden and they blamed Democrats. Doesn’t matter that the US saw significantly less inflation than Europe. Doesn’t matter that Biden’s policies are actually improving inflation. Doesn’t matter that Biden’s infrastructure and chips act created more blue collar jobs. 


The simple fact is that for 2+ years inflation was the topic on all news channels (conservative and liberal) and it got to the point where things, regardless of reality, felt bad on a day-to-day basis. 


So voters ignored how Trump’s policies will make it worse. They haven’t yet and no matter how much you explain how they will, the fact is that inflation did occur under Biden and I feel like most people don’t vote on a theoretical economic possibility (regardless of evidence) versus an actual experience.

“I will follow the law,” she said. “And it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You’re probably familiar with now. It’s a public report that under Donald Trump’s administration, these surgeries were available on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system.” 

Federal law requires inmates to receive access to necessary medical care, and courts have found that this can include medically necessary gender-affirming surgery. Legal obligations to provide this care were also acknowledged by the Federal Bureau of Prisons under the Trump administration. Any efforts to categorically eliminate access to gender-affirming surgical care would likely face legal challenges. 

The Bureau of Prisons’ policy under the Biden administration lets prisoners request gender-affirming surgery, but just two federal prisoners have successfully accessed these procedures and only after multiyear legal challenges, the first in 2022.

"The dems had no real pushback on the scapegoating immigrants for suppressed wages and lack of jobs and housing etc.  The truth is when undocumented migrant workers are documeted & legalized, they are harder for businesses to exploit for cheap labor by threatening to call ICE on them if they organize for better wages & treatment.  This has the effect of incresing labor power across the board, leading to better working conditions and wages, as undocumented workers thus can't be used to undercut existing workers.

Years ago, the dems used to try to humanize migrants and talk about immigration reform.  Now they're running on Trump's 2020 immigration policy.  After an adminsistration where they deported record numbers of immigrants with brutal ICE raids that didn't get mentioned in the press.  The republicans responded with this capitulation to their framing of migrants as a threat by just upping the ante of racism & xenophobia.

Also - if you think mass deportations are going to solve the MASSIVE labor shortages we have in numerous industries like healthcare, construction, agriculture, manufacturing, etc. then you're kidding yourself.  There aren't even enough Americans - with the skills needed or just mathematically - to take those jobs.  We need migrants for those roles - it's a question of 'do we have a humane immigration system that documents all these people and gives them realistic pathways to citizenship' or 'do we leave millions of migrant workers in legal limbo and in a revolving door of ICE raids/deportations and returns to refill those roles but now with shrinking wages they can't organize into unions to do anything about.'

It's a fucking joke.  We basically have two parties doing racist nativism to different degrees.  And both migrant workers and domestic workers get screwed by both parties policies.

Also - Please try to understand that at its core, immigration panic is about the rich business-owning class decimating worker power & freedom of labor to move to where the jobs are, as much as it is about xenophobia & racism.

And then when it comes to podcasts, I don't hosts like Rogan are inherently right-wing, they're stupid and easily persuaded by whatever guest they had in that week. When Rogan had Bernie on he became a Bernie supporter, when he had Trump on he became a Trump supporter. The problem is now enough left-wing people are trying to go on these podcasts, or they're not easy to listen to or entertaining enough to warrant an appearance. So you end up with a bunch of right-wing guests and the podcast slowly migrates right.

Yep, I'm so sick of Reddit progressives blaming this on low information voters, racism, etc.

I was watching my liberal coworkers arguing politics with my conservative coworkers all year and the one thing I noticed was that the liberals genuinely struggled making their arguments.

When a MAGA guy would challenge a liberal to name a Harris policy proposal they actually liked, the liberal couldn't do it. I know Harris had a ton of policy proposals, but the vast majority of progressives, especially those who don't closely follow politics couldn't actually name or describe her proposals. It led to Harris being perceived as a status quo preservation candidate in a time when people genuinely want change.

I'm not defending Trump or Trump voters, but his supporters genuinely can name his policy changes if challenged on the spot. Mass deportation, tariffs, less involvement in Ukraine and spending that money domestically. And then ran circles around liberals when it came to winning the workplace breakroom.

And even when someone could name a Harris policy proposal, it was met with skepticism because time and time again the Democrats did not honor their previous campaign promises. The Democrats didn't remove the Trump Tariffs the last time around, they didn't raise the minimum wage when they had the opportunity, they didn't do anything to lower the skyrocketing cost of housing. Even with Obama's ACA, the landmark democratic accomplishment in recent memory, it needs to be remembered that a lot of the campaign proposals that would have greatly strengthened it were gutted to give it a greater chance of passage. Democrats have given themselves an awfully bad reputation in recent years as the party that doesn't do what they say they will do on the campaign trail and the longtime voters know it.

So even when there was a Harris policy proposal that Trump supporters actually liked, it was still met with skepticism because they know Trump will keep his word when it comes to his campaign promises, they have little faith in the Democrats.

I'm so sick of seeing reddit comments about how there's nothing the Democrats can do to fight these low information voters or racism.

I don't need to delete, because I stand behind what I said: Harris was only running on a right wing platform to people on the far left.  

I can also defend it, but getting caught in argument over at this point is just a waste of our time. She ran on a progressive platform when you actually read all of it. It was all about taxing the rich and giving that money back to the people who need it. She repeated it all the time in her speeches and interviews. She had good policies and voters liked most of her plans over his when they weren't attached to the party. That's a messaging issue , which is what most of the dude replied to me was pointing out. I'm not going to knock her on pushing the bipartisan border bill when everyone outside of leftist on this platform are saying we have a broken immigration system. Part of being the president should be about working with everyone to actually address and fix the problems the country has. That's part of my frustration with the left and why we lost. There's a complete lack of pragmatism in trying to do what we need to win elections from many on left. 

>Many in Dem leadership are suggesting this. Many in the Dem consultant class are also saying it.

Dem leadership always does this because they are beholden to the donor-class that want Dems to cultivate economically conservative voting base.

I literally addressed this. This isn't about going to the right. It's about figuring out messaging and branding that actually wins. She didn't throw trans people under the bus and had attacks on repeat of her bragging about supporting trans rights. If you don't think she's an ally then you're just wrong. The point isn't to abandon supporting trans right, it's about being able to push back on some of the less popular parts without the base collapsing.

We literally lost to fascism and so many on the left are thumbing their nose at us. Now we have to hope that Trump doesn't actually go through his mass deportations and denaturalization. We also have to hope that the evangelical wing of the GOP doesn't push through all of the regressive social policy they want. 

So, yes the rest of us on the left have to figure out which battles to pick and choose to win elections. The leftist who sat out have only shown they're unreliable and don't care about any of the causes they've now put in risk with Trump's victory. If the party caters to them it doesn't guarantee more votes, since the far left is known for their purity tests and goalpost moving.

>She repeated it all the time in her speeches and interviews.

She talked, half-heartedly and only occasionally, about this sort of thing, in between hugging Cheney and talking about she prosecuted international gangs. She had a nice couple weeks where she was selling the anti-big business stuff, right about the time she got Walz, but after her brother-in-law got in her ear, the tune changed. She started bring Mark Cuban out and Walz shut up. The speech she gave during the convention was obscene, easily the most right-wing given by a Democrat at the convention in my life time. She couldn't fucking identify any differences of opinion between her and Biden, who was at historically low approval rating before he stepped down. Please, please, spare me this bullshit. I honestly don't think she could have won no matter what kind of campaign she ran because of her ties to Biden. I genuinely don't. What she did do, in terms of selling her economic policy did help, she turned around like a 17 point deficit on the economy compared to Trump at one point but it hardly mattered because of how deep a hole she was in because of Biden. 

> I'm not going to knock her on pushing the bipartisan border bill when everyone outside of leftist on this platform are saying we have a broken immigration system.

What are you talking about? Leftist think the immigration system is broken too, just in a different way than conservatives. Her support of Biden's immigration bill objectively hurt her with the base, much like hugging Cheney. Republicans are never going to choose the 'Republican-lite' versus a real Republican. She had even less of the Republican vote than Biden did. Honestly, can you even identify what is wrong with immigration in America? My guess is that is a no.

>Part of being the president should be about working with everyone to actually address and fix the problems the country has.

In some magic imagined world that no one actually lives in, sure. You live in a bubble of thought just as thick as any Trump voter. 

>That's part of my frustration with the left and why we lost. There's a complete lack of pragmatism in trying to do what we need to win elections from many on left. 

What the fuck are you even talking about? Do you even know? What is it do you think the left did here? Because I'm gonna be really honest with you, the 'left' is the base of the party. They are the progressives that volunteer, they are the union members, they are pro-peace and anti-military industrial complex people. The average Dem voter just wants people to be nice to each and better government programs. That is the 'left' in the American context. 15 million of them did not come out to vote for Kamala. That is why she lost so bad. 

>It's about figuring out messaging and branding that actually wins.

We know what messaging wins. Her polling showed it. At the beginning when, for those first couple weeks when she picked up Walz and was pushing more economic policies, she polled well enough to actually win. That went away, especially as her messaging changed and she went through the convention.

There aren't 15 million self-identified leftist in America, hell there probably aren't even 5 million. Of those that do identify that way, most live in large cities in blue states. Leftists may or may not have sat out, but their votes almost universally don't matter. PA, Wisconsin, etc. are not full of leftists. Dems failed to actually get the base of the party out to vote.

"Eh, I don’t think either party is good at being “for the poor”, and I have no idea how many of their campaign promises would actually come to fruition, but if you’re going just based on their proposed plans the consensus from economists was that hers would keep taxes/costs lower for low income and raise taxes on the wealthy while trump will do the opposite with his aggressive tariffs and wealthy tax breaks. Meanwhile Harris’s small business tax breaks sounded like exactly what we need.

But she was just the spokesperson for an established team, just as trump is the face for his. I think the bigger benefit to the poor from the democratic side comes from having guys like Pete Buttigieg in the cabinet who actually regulate big companies and protect consumers. On the other hand RFK is going to gut the FDA, which I agree is very corrupt, but I don’t have a lot of faith that the transition isn’t going to be messy and put low income consumers at risk. And now Elon wants to blow up the fed. It’s an aggressive dismantling of the system - which in theory I’m not opposed to but with this rag tag bunch I think it puts poorer people at risk.

And beyond that you have probably the biggest issue which is judges and Supreme Court justices. Because of a string of right wing decisions and oversights we are now seeing women die from miscarriages because hospitals won’t help them. Whatever you think of abortion the execution of the shift to state control has been  fatally incompetent.

And it’s that type of dangerous incompetence I’m afraid of seeing more of from this new right.

All of that is a round about way of saying I do think the establishment is generally safer for the poor. And while inflation has caused a huge burden, ultimately this White House/Fed got it back down. COVID was a crisis but both administrations handled it generally well. Not great but they avoided a crash/depression.

But my original point is that none of that even matters because voters aren’t thinking of any of that at all. I don’t even think it matters what her platform was, people just didn’t trust her.

Honestly I don’t think his supporters care about being reached out to. It is better at this point to just try to create a counter culture to the current establishment and build momentum in the form of resistance. People are more motivated to stand up against something compared to trying to work in forms of political compromise on various minor details. It is all about the marketing and how your movement makes people feel. Reaching out to people that don’t care is just boring and motivates nobody and wins nothing.,2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Did you see the exit polls?

Moderates and undecided 47% felt Kamala was too left-leaning. Considering she lost so much of their vote, you want to lean more into the left? She got criticized in 2020 for being too left-leaning too. What is she supposed to do, go far Right now? 

Also, Tim Walz did not convert a lot of the midwest like we thought. In fact, most of them ignored Tim Walz' folksy midwest charm and just went to the rapist foulmouth instead. So how does putting him in charge of the DNC work?

Bernie also making that ridiculous statement about Dems not connecting at all with the working class. Every policy from Kamala/Walz was to help the working class. She still led in Hispanic total votes (despite losing some) and still led by far in black votes. And many white, black, hispanic Dems are *working class people.* 

Also, many Dem Senators and House Reps WON, and they have the same platform and beliefs of Kamala, so how is this on her?

Just admit, Trump voters voted like complete irrational idiots. So tired of these ""if only X, Y, Z did this"" when it doesn't hold up to scrutiny and data.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

And despite all of this, she failed spectacularly in ways that candidates in recent elections did not.

You shouldn't look at this as an indictment of leftist policies. If anything, this should be seen as an indictment on the strategy of tacking to the right in hopes of picking up more conservatives than the progressives you lose. We don't want two Republican parties.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"I mean, I fundamentally disagree. It would even argue that part of the appeal of Trump is his constantly lying about how his desired changes in the country are populist and will help the average Joe. People actually believe he’ll break down the institutions that support the well-off in the country despite all the evidence to the contrary (as his single biggest legislative accomplishment was $1T tax break for the 0.01% in this country; his moves to break environmental, etc., etc., regulations unanimously help polluting/cheating/damaging businesses). 

The point is, and I hear it from my one explicitly MAGA friend, if there wasn’t Trump, a person like Bernie would be many of these people’s second choice. People legit think Trump will do 2 wildly opposite things at the same time - support the little man AND 100% supporting big business with absolutely no impact to the little man.

But sure, keep trying to convince people to stop supporting MAGA. I’m sure it’ll work one of these days.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"That's not true at all. Case and point, in this exact same election a red state Missouri passed the abortion ban as well as paid leave for workers. We also denied to foot the bill for the county sheriff's retirement with higher Court fees. Those are all left leaning pieces of legislation. The reason the establishment came so hard on Bernie is because not only was he taking over the Democratic base but he was also reaching across party lines to the Republican base. If the Democratic elite ever pulls their head out of their ass and puts forth an actual left-leaning or progressive candidate they will sweep up the next election.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Don't forget the media slandering him and villianizing Medicare 4 all. Also the DNC fucked him over.

He had both rightwing AND centrist (sorta liberal) media outlets attacking him

There's also the time where Elizabeth Warren was claiming that he said a women couldn't be president which Bernie was visually legit confused at on what she was even talking about. (At up until that point my pick was Bernie or warren, she kinda pissed me off from liking her with that stunt)

Oh and good Ol' Blomberg was there to siphon votes from Bernie and warren. Dude legit offered cash for people to campaign for him. He was polling better than biden and biden at one point early on didn't look like he was leading in the primary, but if i remember correctly before Super Tuesday bloomberg dipped out of the primary.

Bernie while I like him and agree with him most of the time, he isn't exactly perfect. If my memory serves 2016 Bernie did not take the lost to Hillary well. 2020 Bernie took lost to biden really well, that could be due to Biden being the few in the DNC that respected Bernie and I think he knew at that point beating Trump was more important.

Part of the reason why Bernie clashes with the rest of the democratic party is his stubbornness to his ideals, which is both his greatest strength and greatest flaw.

She also didn't drill in the economic record of the Biden administration. Her problem was being too general and as an unknown quantity compared to Trump who also had the benefit of having a term under his belt, she needed to really refine her views and be out there more-do more freewheeling interviews, just show herself more. Plus the curse of the incumbent and the Israel Palestine war- she had many issues stacked against her so campaign missteps plus being too general in her appeal to voters PLUS some level of misogyny which Trump also pushed- he literally retruthed 2 posts on Truth social alluding that Kamala sucked cock to get ahead. 

Every social media platform was littered with comments that Willie Brown made her....and she didn't deserve her ascent- crude sexual jokes were put up on billboards and liked in the thousands on Twitter.  This despite the fact that every single powerful person throughout history has benefitted from powerful connections.. as if Trump didn't benefit from having a powerful and successfull father and then getting patronage from Musk and Thiel and then having a really powerful friend in his Judge sister.

I wish she would have been more flexible in her campaign, she got a massive boost of cash and PR when she announced but she (imo) ignored some key demographics and didn’t do enough to differentiate herself from Biden (“I wouldn’t do anything different” or whatever the exact quote was). 

Her/the admins foreign policy was a big one for me personally. The Afghanistan withdrawal, wish-washy response to Israel/Palestine, keeping Ukraine on a leash while they’re fighting to retain independence, I think all of it but the CHIPS act and some other US-Chinese policies were pretty disgraceful. Which sucks, because Trump’s FP is 10x worse. 

Your last paragraph is what’s really disgraceful though. I don’t think it’s all Republicans, but the segment of them that pushes the kind of filth you’re talking about needs to be ripped out of the party root and stem.

I’m the type that believes all politicians need to be held accountable for every single violation of their oath of office and every single ethical breach no matter how big or small, but it’s just plain dishonest to pretend Trump isn’t 10x worse with shady connections/back alley deals/general ratfuckery than just about any other politician currently (if not to date).

The reality is that none of it matters. It's all they got. Until they show up at your doorstep (Que some trumpy moron saying ""uh huh but just wait they will!"") they've got nothing on you. 

Yes, they will cause tangible problems, you will have less money, you might lose your job and your insurance, but I'm not talking about THOSE problems.

Two years until midterms and with enough of a majority we can repair the damage. We only have to resist and delay Trump for two years and we can retake congress and lock him out the rest of his term.

We still have the constitution (if they tear it up that would spark a civil war), which guarantees certain rights including elections. We have state governments that can become bastions against the coming tide.

We need to organize at every single level of governance and do everything in our power to delay these fascists, from the smallest office to the largest.

Majority of Americans don't support MAGA. His policies WILL prove disastrous and unpopular. Many of those who voted for him will turn from him the moment they're bitten in the ass by him, enough to turn the tide in two years.

The left on the other hand

1. Weaponizes the justice system to take out political opponents

2. Controls the mainstream media and all forms of communication on social media. Coordinated strikes against the_donald and trumps twitter in 2020 is textbook silencing of political opponents

3. Polices your language and is not okay with you using words they deem politically incorrect

4. Locked you inside your house for 2 years. Forced the vaccine on you

5. Trying to remove the second amendment

The left in the past has stopped you from leaving your house, controls the information you consume, prevents you from saying things they dont agree with to the best of their ability and forced you to take vaccines you may not want.

"> The majority of the American people just voted to destabilize the west. 

There were about 240 million eligible voters in the 2024 US election and the final tally might be about 75 million voting for trump. That's around 31%.

trump got about 26% of eligible voters in 2016 the first time he was handed power in an election.

The problem in America is not a majority of people supporting fascism. The problem is that only a minority can be counted on to support democracy and human rights.

If Harris winds up with 70 million votes then that means that about 29% of eligible voters showed up to support democracy and oppose a candidate who staged a coup to try to install himself as dictator a few years ago. Even a perfect democracy (and the USA is far from a perfect democracy) will not survive in the long run when only a minority can be counted on to vote to preserve it.

The American experiment to build a democracy is over. Not because a dictator seized power in a military coup but rather because not enough Americans want to continue the experiment.

If we could also do away with the electoral college, and gerrymandered voter districts, we would be a truer democracy. Maybe instead of giving every state regardless of population the same number of senators, we could assign them based on population, we could more positively deem the elected truly representative? It could be better and hopefully we will get there. The wheels of change move swiftly or slowly depending on perspective. We can do better and I hope we will continue helping the less fortunate.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

>How are they going to fix our schools when the Department of Education gets eliminated

I don't know. We've never ever educated children without it before. It scares me, thinking of a world without a federal Department of Education. How would we land on the moon, split the atom, develop chemical fertilizers? How would great novels be written, great music composed? How? For before the nation rose, the Department of Education was there. When John Smith drove the first piling of the Jamestown wall the Department of Education was there waiting for him. Some say it was always there, shining like a beacon the hillside as the first fish crawled out onto the land. Oh woe, oh lamentation, how terrible that the shining lamp should be snuffed out by the darkness. 

>How are they going to start businesses when they’re unemployed and the SBA has been gutted?

I don't know. It's simply impossible to capitalize a small business without a government loan. I do know that federal employees would find it trivially easy to run any business. After all, they are federal employees and as we have established, federal employees are simply above the rest of us. They should never ever have to suffer a downsizing, that's something the rest of us have to do. It's important to know your place in life. 

But without the SBA, I don't know how they could obtain the capital. If only there were large organizations people saved their money in. These organizations could then lend the money out at interest, and distribute the resulting profit to the people who save their money.

"Justifying that it “worked overall” disregards the pain experienced by those who lived under it, and subscribes to the colonialist, racist viewpoint that India was a massive backwater prior to Britains rule.

Roberts has been making his mark on an institution that came to prominence during the Reagan years and has long been seen as an incubator of conservative policy and thought.

The lesson of Trump’s first year in office, Roberts told me, is that “the Trump administration, with the best of intentions, simply got a slow start.

""DOD PERSONNEL 
The men and women of America’s armed forces are the most critical component of our national defense strategy, but in recent years, they have been overextended, undervalued, and insu ciently resourced. Their families help them to carry the burden of service, but the assistance they receive is disproportionately less than the sacrifices they make. Young civilians who would thrive in a military environment are disenfranchised when educators and influencers discourage them from learning about military service and preparing for the honor of wearing America’s uniform. 

The United States military is an extraordinary institution, sta ed by exceptional people who have defended our nation and changed the course of history, but the Biden Administration, through word and deed, has treated the armed forces as just another place to work. We must restore our military to a place of honor and respect and recruit and retain the individuals who will meet the rigorous standards of excellence that are required for membership in the world’s greatest fighting force. 

Needed Reforms 

Rescue recruiting and retention. 
Recruiting was the worst in 2022 that it has been in two generations and is expected to be even worse in 2023. Some of the problems are self-inflicted and ongoing. The recruiting problem is not service-specific: It affects the entire Joint Force. 

1. Appoint a Special Assistant to the President who will maintain liaison with Congress, DOD, and all other interested parties on the issue of recruiting and retention. 
2. Improve recruiting by suspending the use of the recently introduced MHS Genesis system that uses private medical records of potential recruits at Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS), creating unnecessary delays and unwarranted rejections.11 
3. Improve military recruiters’ access to secondary schools and require completion of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB)—the military entrance examination—by all students in schools that receive federal funding.
4. Encourage Members of Congress to provide time to military recruiters during each townhall session in their congressional districts. 
5. Increase the number of Junior ROTC programs in secondary schools.""",2024_11_10,06_45_08

""Under his plan, he said, the ASVAB would be used to identify potential military “weaknesses” and help plug knowledge gaps as U.S. defense leaders size up competitors like China, and devise plans for possible conflicts with a range of foreign adversaries.

I'm not trying to dismiss your view points, and it's definitely not for everyone, but it's not a bad idea if your options are between that or working at a fast food place/being put in debt for college. 

Also, i have a bit of a theory on why mental health is such a big issue with the military. At least in the USMC, I met a ton, and I mean a ton of people who kind of really liked the idea of killing someone. They hear stories about WWII and Vietnam, and they think that's what made the great men of the past. And this attracts people who aren't exactly in a good place mentally to begin with. Again, this is just personal experience, and hey, if I'm wrong, I'll admit it, but I think young people in general just need better mental health in general.

I just don’t see it as constructive to focus on that though. 

I’m going to stay focused on accountability for the Democratic Party’s leadership. Particularly their process for selecting who our party’s nominee is for president.

They are perfectly comfortable erasing the party’s members completely out of that process and just telling us who the nominee is. That is, completely, unacceptable to me. Over my dead body am I letting them do that again. 

If they were good at strategy, tactics, messaging, etc… ? And their decisions led to wins? To Supreme Court majorities? To control of the executive and legislative branches? That might be different.

But they are truly, truly, terrible at it.

They don’t seize opportunities to secure liberal justices on the court when they have them… (the R party would NEVER risk a Supreme Court seat, for example, they know they are precious… and they will have two retirements and two appointments delivered to their voters this congressional term… their leadership is not strategically stupid). 

Our leadership is strategically stupid. They give away the political game in every conceivable way. 

Their leadership and choices over the last decade have had dire consequences for the party and the nation. 

I digress… but my focus will be entirely on that. On taking out the trash that is the Democratic Party’s ruling class, and replacing them with people who know what they are doing.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"We nominate delegates by popular primary, except for the superdelegates who only matter if no one wins on the first ballot. These popularly-elected delegates are pledged to their corresponding candidates, unless a candidate drops out after the primaries, in which case the delegates select a replacement. In this case they selected the running mate of the popular vote winner who, according to [polling](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/most-democrats-are-very-enthusiastic-about-kamala-harris-democratic-nominee), was by far the popular choice at that point.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"That’s a lot of techno babble that = nobody got a choice. 

Let’s not pretend like who the delegates were told to support was bottom up and not too down.

As for the selection… hoards of the rank and file warned that if the top down orders were Harris, we would re-run 2016.

That prediction was easy to call.

What was a surprise was that she did worse than Clinton.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Now tell me.

Do you, honestly, believe that Harris was the product of any bottom up decision making by the party? Or was that top down decision making?

Was that a small d democratic process? Or were we told to eat our vegetables?",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"I see several glimmers. 

1. This is the same situation as 2017. Trump had a trifecta then and nothing got done. The Republican's, with a majority in the House, is still a shambles and will remain so because of how tight so many races have been. Plenty of moderates by necessity there, including some that voted to impeach Trump and won again. And as they're preparing for the midterms, it's proof enough that they'll try to win fairly because buy in is still necessary. Besides, elections are run by states, not the federal government. The federal government has reach, but I think you overestimate it. The states proved themself litigious the first term, and are again.

2. Trump is a selfish individual. I've no doubt he thinks that this is the last election they'd need to vote in – because this is the last election he's going to stand in again. One recurring theme at his rallies was that this is the end of his movement. There's nothing to pass on, because he doesn't care about passing it on. 

3. Trump is a unique individual. The fact that so many people voted for him and left the rest of their ballot blank speaks to something about him that's captivating. He's been a national figure for decades with opinions baked in. He had to carry much of Congress over or near the finish line because they're not him, however hard they try. The others, meanwhile, are wet rags though quite ambitious nonetheless. 

4. The first term was incompetent, and there's reason to believe this one will be as well. Some things might be better managed with people like Susie Wiles, but Trump and his orbit lead me to believe that it'll be high on bluster, low on action. The probability of the worst coming to pass is low, but it's something to be prepared for.

Comparisons between the US and Russia are overblown. The two countries are fundamentally different. But Americans need problems to be up front and in their face before they make changes; they won't pay attention to history or probability. One lesson for Democrat's to learn is to make the *now* more important than the past or distant future.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Because there is going to be no chance at meaningful change in our lifetime anymore at the national level.

Start refusing to send tax dollars to Washington, and keep it in state.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"There are a few things I can think of to do that are giving me hope.
-start finding the local organizations, including government and non-profits that meet concrete needs. If people aren't worried about their kids having shoes and being able to eat and getting to work, they might have some mental energy for other stuff. When you aren't in survival mode, social media isn't as addictive. This will help with the propaganda machine.
-start building community. Start with like minded people. Do stuff together, fun stuff-you can't ask your neighbor to do something if you don't know your them (I saw someone bring a rock painting table to a queer coffee shop). Then do the stuff like help each other with house projects and car problems. Then learn how to de-program people from propaganda, and how to educate them-from reading to politics to economics. Knowing the audience will matter. Figure out the movable levers and move them, which will start to loosen others. But don't waste energy on anything else. As the movement grows-and as the pain of this administration grows-people will start to look at these activities and reconsider their positions. But until then, know what pieces are movable for who.
-once there is community, real resistance can happen. Like dismantling modern concentration camps and standing up to the bullies en masse. Because that's all they are, insecure jerks who don't have the emotional intelligence to have real relationships with people so they substitute with fear and control. Fascism relies on what you are feeling now to keep you down and out. I understand why you are feeling the way you are. But they (narcissists, oligarchs, fascists, authoritarians, etc.) NEED the people for a lot of things: labor, economic factors, adoration, etc. and when we don't give it to them, they crumble. If, and right now it is an if, violence ends up being perpetuated against the resistance, we go underground with the communities we have built, and we protect people. We push back. We actively dismantle the systems they try to use against us. There was opposition to Hitler. There is real opposition to Putin.

"The difference between then and now is that before, MAGA didn't know how far it could actually go in regards to defeating checks and balances; there was also some degree of resistance from institutions and within the GOP. In essence, the first term was an inadvertent test run - they didn't know just what they were really capable of until the aftermath of J6, when no one in power was held accountable and our guardrails were revealed to be made of paper and handshakes, and that the American people, by and large, didn't give a shit that one of our political parties tried to literally overthrow the government.


Now, they've had years to study all of that, refine their approach, and have purged all internal resistance - MAGA *is* the Republican Party, and they know there's essentially no limit to how cruel, terrible, and Machiavellian they can be.


And now they control the *entire federal government* in just two months. They also have learned, through trial and error, how to work with the dangerously unstable man that just became President, and thus more effectively realize their agenda.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Wholesale replacement of an existing apparatus has shown that it doesn't speed things up, but slows them down, because new people don't understand the levers. I think it's a mistake to thank that *everyone* in current power is in lockstep with Trump, even in his own party. But their effectiveness is severely limited if they pretend to be otherwise. Republicans would love it if nothing were to change and they could just blame Democrats for everything.

"Part of why X is so terrifying is the same reason YouTube/Insta/TikTok can be so dangerous - people get paid from it. People used to be motivated to push a certain narrative/image just from the ego boost of likes, but now throw in thousands of dollars. It causes desperation.

I’ve had to drill it into my daughter’s head since she discovered YouTube kids 5 years ago that content creation is a job - not real life. They get paid by you watching the video, so they will do *anything* to get you to watch it.

The difference is it’s not as easy as explaining to a 7 year old that no, these families don’t actually play crazy games and let their kids get whatever they want from the store as long as they can grab it in 20 minutes all day everyday, but a make-belief story like a movie. It’s explaining to grown adults that, no, these people don’t really believe what they’re saying, they just know you’re stupid enough to believe it and they don’t give a fuck about you, only their ability to make money

Twitter raises the danger because most platforms have moderation and they will take your money away if you break the rules. On Twitter, you’re rewarded for it, and these “influencers” have figured that out. They can post whatever lie they want as long as they go viral and bring in traffic. And with each viral tweet, they’re getting bolder and bolder (greedier and greedier) to the point they’re point blank making outlandish lies up and people don’t blink before believing it.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

It's why so many were surprised by Kamala's defeat, all because they had shut themselves off into echo chambers of happy feels.

That said, X isn't the worst platform to step back from. All I'd suggest is that people diversify (with diverse thoughts and ideas) their social environments and expand their information acquisition to areas that aren't just reinforcing your bubbles.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Leftists… hear me now. You already lived through a Trump presidency and you were fine. You’re going to be fine during and after this term too, AND you’ll be able to afford groceries!
Stop freaking out. Stop throwing childish temper tantrums on TikTok. Stop instantly believing whatever lies someone tells you about Trump… I just watched a video with a teacher telling her students that Trump is going to deport all of the Black people to Africa. Another said Trump voters should be forced to wear MAGA hats under the law. Kinda like how the Nazis forced Jews to wear a Star of David. Well, exactly like that. People are saying they’re going to murder every Trump voter that they can find. Others are calling for a third assassination attempt and saying they hope the next one is successful.
It’s insane.
I know it’s hard, but turn off the TV, get out of the astroturfed echo chamber and at least TRY to think for yourselves. I know you don’t like it, but Trump won fair and square in a historic landslide. Do any of you even consider that maybe you were wrong? The self entitlement and egotism are off the scales.

It’s going to be very sad for Reddit, both sides will actually have a voice. How terrible is that.

The reason people don’t like Twitter is because everyone is allowed to be heard. Too bad the left will no longer control the media and the message. You have to wonder if the left will ever win again once everyone is allowed to speak. It amazes me that people call for any speech they don’t like to be taken down. That is true communism. Sadly, a large percentage of people on this platform support that. We are very lucky to have the outcome that we did on Tuesday.

"Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act


The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was a US law that raised import duties on over 2,000 items, averaging a 40-60% increase. The act, named after its sponsors Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis Hawley, aimed to shield American farmers and businesses. However, it worsened the Great Depression’s international economic climate. The tariff raised duties on agricultural imports by around 20%, and other countries retaliated with their own tariffs on American goods.

Purpose
The act was intended to protect the U.S. economy from the Great Depression.
Impact
The act had several negative consequences, including:
• Increased prices: The act raised the price of food and other items, making them unaffordable for most people.
• Decreased exports: The act dramatically reduced the amount of goods exported from the U.S.
• Retaliatory tariffs: Other countries responded by raising their own tariffs on American goods, which further reduced trade.
• Bank failures: The act contributed to bank failures, especially in agricultural regions.

Trump’s tariffs had several negative effects on the U.S. economy:

	1.	Increased Costs for Consumers and Businesses: The tariffs, particularly on Chinese goods, led to higher prices on a wide range of consumer goods and raw materials, such as steel and aluminum. This increase in costs was often passed on to American consumers and businesses, reducing their purchasing power and profit margins.

	2.	Retaliatory Tariffs: Other countries, including China and the European Union, imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, hurting American farmers and manufacturers. This led to decreased demand for U.S. agricultural and industrial products, causing financial difficulties for many American producers.

	3.	Supply Chain Disruptions: The uncertainty and additional costs associated with tariffs disrupted global supply chains, complicating production for manufacturers that relied on imported components. Businesses had to reevaluate their supply chains, which sometimes led to inefficiencies and additional expenses.

	4.	Reduced Investment and Growth: The uncertainty surrounding trade policies and tariffs led to reduced business investment. Companies hesitated to expand or invest in new projects due to concerns about the economic impact of ongoing trade tensions.

	5.	Slower Economic Growth: The tariffs contributed to slower economic growth, as they negatively impacted both consumer spending and business investment. Various studies suggested that the trade war reduced U.S. GDP by a modest but significant amount.

	6.	Impact on Employment: Some industries that relied on imported materials faced job losses or lower profit margins due to increased costs. For example, sectors like manufacturing and construction, which are heavy users of steel and aluminum, were affected by higher input prices.

While some sectors, like domestic steel manufacturing, saw short-term gains, the broader negative economic impacts were felt across the economy.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Educate yourself.

I am a software engineer. I work with ML regularly. I know, on a fundamental level, HOW the AI works.

Clearly, you do not.

You can ask ChatGPT anything and it will try its hardest to try and say things to make your point. It is biased by the input data when it's considering its output; it does not do any kind of ""free thinking"" but instead uses a network of weights to work out what result you want it to give you. Hence - people-pleaser.

I'm not denying it's a game-changing tool. But also going ""lol it doesn't hallucinate"" shows that ZERO understanding of how it works under the hood. This is a common, known, well-supported problem. Even the modern models which search the web will fall back to making stuff up if they can't find anything that supports your argument.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Here are ten reasons why Trump's tariffs were viewed as negative for the U.S. economy:

1. **Higher Consumer Prices**: Tariffs on imported goods led to higher prices for everyday items, from electronics to clothing, negatively impacting consumers' purchasing power.

2. **Increased Production Costs**: U.S. manufacturers faced higher costs for raw materials like steel and aluminum, which often led to higher production costs and reduced profit margins.

3. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Tariffs disrupted global supply chains, making it more difficult and costly for businesses to source materials and products from overseas.

4. **Retaliatory Tariffs**: Many trading partners, including China and the European Union, imposed tariffs on U.S. goods, hurting American exports, especially in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing.

5. **Job Losses in Affected Industries**: While some jobs in steel and aluminum industries were protected, other sectors (e.g., agriculture, automotive) faced job losses due to retaliatory tariffs and higher costs.

6. **Lower Economic Growth**: By raising costs and reducing trade, tariffs contributed to slower economic growth and potentially higher inflation.

7. **Distorted Market Forces**: Tariffs interfered with free market dynamics, causing inefficiencies by pushing businesses to rely on less competitive, more expensive domestic suppliers.

8. **Uncertainty for Businesses**: The unpredictability of trade policies and tariff rates created uncertainty, which discouraged investment and long-term planning among U.S. companies.

9. **Global Trade Tensions**: The tariff war exacerbated tensions with key trading partners, leading to a more fragmented global trade environment and potentially undermining international alliances.

10. **Impact on Small Businesses**: Small businesses, which often rely on affordable imports for resale, were disproportionately harmed by higher costs and tariffs, weakening their competitiveness.

These are based on Trump's term and are reality based in the same way yours were.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

The Good:

* Fiscal Surplus: Turned a primary deficit of 2.9% of GDP into a surplus of 1.5% through austerity measures.
* Market Confidence: S&P Merval stock index hit record highs; sovereign bonds gained value.
* Inflation Reduction: Monthly inflation dropped from 25% in December 2023 to 3.5% by September 2024.

The Bad

* Increased Poverty: Poverty rose from 42% to 53%; extreme poverty climbed from 11.9% to 18.1%.
* Recession: GDP projected to shrink by 3.8% in 2024.
* Social Unrest: Austerity measures led to strikes and protests.

And he is following Trump's plans to the T, so this is a pretty good indicator of what is ahead.  Trump and Elon will drastically slash Government spending while simultaneously cutting taxes for the rich who don't need it, plus the wild card of mass deportations will cause massive ripples in the economy.  Remember when Elon told us to prepare for hardships ahead, this is what he is talking about, its happening in Argentina.  And the sad thing is we could have all the good and none of the bad if we simply raised taxes on the ultra wealthy, gone after price gougers, shored up the IRS more to go after rich tax cheats, and used government regulation to make ***temporary*** price controls on essentials goods and services like food, energy, medicine, etc.  But of course if you even suggest that your a socialist commie maximalist.

Nebraska is strange because they had two ballot initiatives- one that would ban abortions in the second and third trimesters. This initiative won by 55%.
There was also a separate ballot initiative in favor of abortion access. 51% of voters were against it.

*If Trump received around 74 million votes in the popular vote, how many of those voters are Men with at least one daughter?*

And here is what it told me:

*To estimate how many of the 74 million Trump voters might be men with at least one daughter, we'll apply some averages:*

*1. Male Voters: Roughly 47–50% of Trump voters in the 2024 election were men, so let's assume about 36–37 million male Trump voters in a pool of 74 million voters.*

*2. Fathers with Daughters: Using the earlier estimate that approximately 35% of men in the U.S. have at least one daughter, we apply this percentage:*

*36 million male Trump voters × 35% ≈ 12.6 million male Trump voters with at least one daughter.*

*This estimate suggests that approximately **12.6 million male Trump voters from the 74 million total voters may have at least one daughter.** This is a rough estimate based on population averages and could vary with more specific demographic data.*

So roughly 13 million men told their daughters EXACTLY how they view those daughters.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

And there were a lot of people I interacted with who I got the impression agreed with me, whatever you think of Biden or Harris, Trump is a shitty dude who really isn't qualified to be in charge of anything, and there's no planet on which you can vote for Trump and call yourself a good person.

I'm coming to the realization this week that a lot of those people lied to my face. If bad things happen to the ones who were being truthful, that sucks but my empathy no longer exists.

"He had a similar level of control over the government during his first term too, minus the Supreme Court which will embolden him to make worse decisions. My only prediction for this is that he’s gonna end up losing his majority in the senate during the midterms. 

Dems need a lot of things to start with but first and foremost, they need new leadership. Someone who’s experienced with how post 2020 elections work and voters think, who isn’t too high up on their horse to play dirty and can make sure people know what they’re doing. My main hope is that Biden’s PR team continue to work with the dems moving forward. The shade they threw during Biden’s recovery period for the economy was fucking legendary, and we need more of that.

Lastly, if by some intervention of God the dems manage a majority in senate and house during the Midterm, then they need to pass regulatory laws regarding what constitutes news media as well as anti misinformation laws. 

Free media was considered important to democracy because they were supposed to be unbiased but it’s clear that the Trump campaign had the full support of any media agency that thought that his presidency would generate clicks. Media stopped being unbiased when they prioritized money over news coverage, and times have changed. 

We need to require news channels to be held to a higher standard as they inform the American public, and not allow walking turds like Fox ""News” to parade themselves around like they are one. Include laws to force them to advertise their status as entertainment media, that they’re not obligated to fact check or speak the truth in any way.

For actual news channels we need to have laws make them cover all candidates with equal discretion. Trumps schtick for years has been to create controversies so his name gets brought up more, and the media loves it cause it generates outrage clicks. Equal discretion in coverage, by maybe having similar numbers of articles and airtime covering each candidate would eliminate that bullshit real fast. And include the other candidates too for the love of god, I didn’t even know who tf Jill Stein was until I saw her on the voting machine.

Targeting people without the education and/or knowledge to know better and selling quick, easy results from doing almost exactly what you already wanted to do anyway, in exchange for money/influence. Problem is, the solutions don't work.

Democrats, as deeply flawed as they are, offer something more like ""look, I know it's hard, but it'll get better if you just eat your vegetables, get some exercise, and go to sleep on time"". That's a really tough sell against ""broccoli will kill your grandmother, here's a chocolate bar that will literally solve every problem"" when people don't know better.

And, with all of the misinformation going around, it can be very difficult for someone to know better. Many people don't have the time or education to be able to really scrutinize the claims. Some people grew up and still live in communities where straying from the conservative line is akin to blasphemy, so they hardly had a chance. Small, rural communities tend to be that way, not because people are dumb, but because people tend to accept what those around them say and think as truth, and conservatism managed to garner near-universal support somewhere in history.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"I ain't no fancy city lawyer

But didn't SNL get in legal trouble for hosting Harris and not trump? Meanwhile twitter is blatantly pushing trump stuff. 

I'm usually on the side of 'private corporations do whatever they want as a platform', so I never did like the equal time rule. Candidates aren't equal and the false equivalency really only helps the crazier extremist ones appear legitimate.

Just one of those weird things i've noticed. I know it's technically because the law is for TV/Radio, which is obviously stupid and why we should get rid of it.

But also, as it relates more with the OP, the U.S. government backing a private corporation to trample EU laws is several thousand magnitudes beyond free speech.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"I am against it. But I am also against free speech absolution-ism and the increasing use and abuse of AI on twitter to color public opinion. I was against Trump being banned from the platform not because I support him but because banning someon- specially someone with a public profile like Trump does not really achieve anything..And especially since he was an ex-President. Im with Jack Dorsey in that Trump should never have been deplatformed..but there are some extremists with large followings that need to be reigned in periodically but are not- community notes can only go so far.. 

And i don't trust one person with one specific ideological bent dictating what kind of posts and tweets to promote and which not. Musk himself has a large following on the platform and he solely promotes Republicans and republican journalists on there. He has also deplatformed some liberal leaning journalists. So where is the fairness and impartiality there. And now he has the President ear.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"I'm going to upvote because of the edit - made me laugh hahahaha. Seriously though, I'm guessing you got downvoted and if that's the case partially that's a way to signal for people to say passive aggressively they don't appreciate your comment. These are the reasons why people can't have open conversations and why the right won - how are we to expect people to listen and learn when we bash them over the head for simple questions 

Anyways, to answer your question, and this is my personal take, it's not that there's a suppression or anything like that. A lot of people that complain about it are right wingers and they don't have the empathy to realize that what they write or say can be conceived as racist or inappropriate. Twitter not doing things can actually open them up to liabilities. 

So, if Trump goes through with his promise over free speech, it no longer becomes these companies problems. For the most part, these companies might eve prefer that because they'd save money on having to screen and monitor - if any advertisers complains, they can take it up with the US government. 

Off tangent, the thing I don't think Trump and his followers realize is that the moment they make their ""neutral"" stance thing an actual policy they're setting themselves up for failure in the future",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"TV and radio started as using public frequencies . Since there is a limit on the amount of usable frequencies, the government regulated that private companies could use them if they proved to be for the public good. Internet so far has no oversight because theoretically it's only limited by private networks built to support it. Yes that's simplistic. But the series of tubes is privately maintained. Even though public money was used to build much of it, but that's a different rant for a different time. 

Anyway that's things are the way they are. Should it be regulated. I don't know. I do find it weird that Republicans are suddenly the party of big government though.

Hell, Deus Ex 1 nearly spelled it out word-for-word to the player within the first minute of the game's opening, and that was over 2 decades ago. Human Revolution hit you over the head with it, and Cyberpunk 2077's plot is literally that sentence from the very first second of each origin story. 

At least some of the songs and music in cyberpunk settings are bangers, so that's the only silver lining I see in it. Resist and Disorder by Rezodrone is a straight banger.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Waaahh...the politician didn't make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Waaahh...She didn't make me feel special enough. Grow the F up FFS. Very few people, if any, get everything they want in a political candidate. To view elections in this manner indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of electoral politics and an infantile worldview more broadly. Elections are about making concessions and choosing the candidate that moves you closer to where you want to be policy wise. If you want things to change beyond that, you should get involved and stop assuming someone else will do the hard work of Democracy for you. Our government is barely functioning because too many Americans just assume Democracy is the default position. It's not. It requires hard work and civil engagement and we're closer than we've ever been before to finding that out the hard way.

For those of us who actually understand how the federal governments works, this election was first and foremost about ensuring we still have a functioning Republic in 4 years. Maybe these voters aren't aware, but forces have been hard at work for 20+ years taking a sledgehammer to the concept of an equitable, egalitarian and pluralistic form of government . They want to starve the federal government and turn the US into a Christian fundamentalist autocracy and the American people just handed them the keys to the entire operation. So sorry, but you did not in fact advocate for yourself and your economic situation by abstaining or voting for Donald Trump. You literally locked in the most anti-social, illiberal, and economically destructive policies for decades to come and that's the rosier possible outcome.

Many progressives made white people out to be some shade of bad. Even if you were for the team you needed to regulate your volume, give space, check yourself at every turn. There was no nuance often- it was “if you are a minority, particularly BIPOC, you are an Angel.”

The least vaccinated demo in my city was black identifying. Every day my progressive friends ranted about the stupid rednecks who wouldn’t get the shot.

Nobody wanted to critique anything non-white- if you said that burning down a Target was a bad thing to do, you were accused of tone policing. If you said: “the border should have some rules” you were inhumane.

Then, white people leave the Trump ticket and their losses are made up for in gains of minorities.

Bro, I could have told you that all sorts of people were dumb but you only wanted to make me even more of an ally for the thing I already supported by making me reject critical thinking.

"How did they become legalized migrants? I suspect a good majority of them were once illegal immigrants or decedents from illegal immigrants. As a centrist, I do see and empathize with the burden tax payers have to take on for a flood of immigrants. But it is a bit rich to say that they are legal migrants because I know it is very difficult to be a legal migrant in the US (took me 16+ years to become a permanent resident and I have a PhD). For most immigrants, they have to either be illegal first and apply for asylum (sometimes with false pretext); or marry an American (again, lots of fake marriages happening there); or get sponsorship from a family member who is already an American citizen (takes about 3 years). 

Otherwise, it would normally take 7+ years at least (if you are very lucky, that is) to get a permanent residency status through legal means, which includes studying in college to completion (Elon Musk didn’t; that’s why his immigration status is dubious and I am sure he broke the law there, but the rich have different rules 🤷🏽‍♂️); and then work for an employer who would sponsor you a work visas AND eventually a green card (spoiler alert: not too many exists, meaning you need to be either working for an abusive employer or a for a big name tech/a really big corporation with established HR department for immigration). Or you can go get a PhD, do really good research (or at least publish in a lot of good journals/venues), and get  green card via O-1 visa route for people with extraordinary ability/achievement.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"It's coming from their old cultures, which are authoritarian - cultures where corruption is taken for granted and wide open.  Their politics are way more ""drama-driven"" than our are (if you can believe it). They have heard strong men all their lives. Men are dominant in their culture; women are second-class citizens and sometimes property.

Look at the Arab Spring? Remember that? Remember how the Liberal West cheered it on? Remember the month's long drama in the streets?  How did that turn out?  EVERY SINGLE NATION that participated in Arab Spring ended up with a MORE autocratic government than before - and in Syria's case the complete disintegration of that nation by the very autocrat who ruled it (Assad) who remains in power.

Latin American and African (and even Southeast Asian cultures like India) immigrants also come from mostly male-driven, paternalistic, authoritarian cultures. 

I'm not saying that all immigrants from the above regions are captive to authoritarian appeals, but the bulk of them are - including many of the women. A lot has been written about the time bomb waiting for the Dems once Latinos begin to gain some economic hegemony, Latino men are conservative, mostly.

So, combine all of the above with AI-driven targeting on social media, where a majority of the above folks (including us, especially GenZ) get their information, and you end up with the result we saw on Tuesday.

This race is not about policy - you can't beat well-targeted propaganda and cultural propensities with policy promised; you have to meet them on the same turf.

Gaza is now finished, period. Just one day after the election, Netenyahu said that Palestinians were not going to be able to resettle in Gaza. So how did all those protest votes work out.

These people are going to learn a horrible lesson under Trump and especially under the pure fascists who advise, write, and make-up Trump's administration. NONE of this is due to Trump's smarts; he;s smart only as a conniving malignant narcissist. Trump is a useful idiot for the evil behind him.

This time Trump wants those on his team, on board to deliver on what he said and what the majority of Amerians who voted, gave him the mandate to do.

This is the 2nd time around - the first time had its share of long time players who liked to tell the new guy, well, no, this is what we should do, when America electedhim because they were sick of the old bs, the same old same old by the same old, same old career players.

But you can headline it as they did here to get your clicks and make the losing party feel better about well being out of touch with most Americans, in denial about the state of things, just how awful a path we have been on.

"> The whole point of the cabinet is to further the Presidents agenda.

it's an advisory role... 

>The tradition of the Cabinet arose out of the debates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention regarding whether the president would exercise executive authority solely or collaboratively with a cabinet of ministers or a privy council. As a result of the debates, the Constitution (Article II, Section 1, Clause 1) vests ""the executive power"" in the president singly, and authorizes—but does not compel—the president (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1) to ""require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices"".[2][3] The Constitution does not specify what the executive departments will be, how many there will be, or what their duties will be. 

for example

>Functionally, the president may give wide latitude to department heads and often it is legally possible for a Cabinet member to exercise certain powers over his or her own department against the president's wishes, but in practice this is highly unusual due to the threat of dismissal",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"The good thing is that the president in times of peace cannot remove military officers except through court martial procedures, which means top leadership will insulate themselves from removal for the absurd stuff. However, this is in times of peace. 

In times of war, the president can remove anyone he/she so choses. Additionally,a military officer can be displaced by by the Senate installing another officer in the same places, essentially removing them from position, but as we saw with Tuberville holding up military appointments the Democrats can shut down this process.

Added context: In democracies, militaries work together with civilian governements for the good of the nation, however thw military has its own power structures and every military in the world has its limit to what it will take from civilian governments. That limit usually results in a coup and in many cases the establishment of a junta dictatorship. Seeing as how professional US military officers are and how allegiant they are to the Constitution (you swear and oath to defend the constitution, not defend the president), if a junta arose in the US it is a possibility they restablish the constitution but omly remove civilian leadership. A junta and coup happening is still unlikely to happen unless the Trump administration really pushes the militaries buttons with very disliked orders (ie launching nukes at US or ally cities or even ordering nuclear first strike)",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Yes. Historian Timothy Snyder puts it better than I ever could in this starkly blunt piece...as you say it does no good to refuse to accept the reality that America voted democracy itself out of existence on Nov 5

>Unaccountable to the law and to voters, the dictator has no reason to consider anything beyond his own personal interests.  In the twenty-first century, those are simple: dying in bed as a billionaire.  To enrich himself and to stay out of prison, the strongman dismantles the justice system and replaces civil servants with loyalists. 

>The new bureaucrats will have no sense of accountability.  Basic government functions will break down. Citizens who want access will learn to pay bribes.  Bureaucrats in office thanks to patronage will be corrupt, and citizens will be desperate.  Quickly the corruption becomes normal, even unquestioned. 

>As the fantasy of strongman rule fades into everyday dictatorship, people realize that they need things like water or schools or Social Security checks.  Insofar as such goods are available under a dictatorship, they come with a moral as well as a financial price.  When you go to a government office, you will be expected to declare your personal loyalty to the strongman.   

>If you have a complaint about these practices, too bad.  Americans are litigious people, and many of us assume that we can go to the police or sue.  But when you vote a strong man in, you vote out the rule of law.  In court, only loyalism and wealth will matter.  Americans who do not fear the police will learn to do so.  Those who wear the uniform must either resign or become the enforcers of the whims of one man.


____________________________________________

>Everybody (except the dictator and his family and friends) gets poorer.  The market system depends upon competition.  Under a strongman, there will be no such thing.  The strongman's clan will be favored by government.  Our wealth inequality, bad enough already, will get worse.  Anyone hoping for prosperity will have to seek the patronage of the official oligarchs. Running a small business will become impossible.  As soon as you achieve any sort of success, someone who wants your business denounces you. 

>In the fantasy of the strongman, politics vanishes and all is clear and bright.  In fact, a dreary politics penetrates everything.  You can't run a business without the threat of denunciation.  You can't get basic services without humiliation.  You feel bad about yourself.  You think about what you say, since it can be used against you later.  What you do on the internet is recorded forever, and can land you in prison.

>Public space closes down around you.  You cannot escape to the bar or the bowling alley, since everything you say is monitored.  The person on the next stool or in the next lane might not turn you in, but you have to assume they will.  If you have a t-shirt or a bumper sticker with a message, someone will report you.  Even if you just repeat the dictator's words, someone can lie about you and denounce you.  And then, if you voted for the strongman, you will be confused.  But you should not be.  This is what you voted for.

>Denunciation becomes normal behavior.  Without law and voting, denouncing others helps people to feel safe.  Under strongman rule, you cannot trust your colleagues or your friends or even your family.  Political fear not only takes away all public space; it also corrupts all private relationships.  And soon it consumes your thoughts.  If you cannot say what you think, you lose track of what you believe.  You cease to be yourself.


And:

>Once this process begins, it is hard to stop.  At the present stage of the strongman fantasy, people imagine an exciting experiment.  If they don't like strongman rule, they think, they can just elect someone else the next time.  This misses the point.  If you help a strongman come to power, you are eliminating democracy.  You burn that bridge behind you.  The strongman fantasy dissolves, and real dictatorship remains.

A) Whatever Biden _could_ order using his “immunity” would likely _not_ be carried out by whoever he asked because members of the Democratic Party are not a cult, and

B) SCOTUS would choose to interpret any action Biden took to stop Trump from taking power as not immune, because _they_ ultimately hold that decision, again, by design, at the legal level.

"And that desire was inflamed and encouraged by 20+yrs Russian disinformation campaign exported into every Western liberal democracy on earth not just America, in order to sow discord, division and weaken our societies from within; meaning we are doing the damage most effectively to ourselves.

It was just that America is particularly vulnerable due to several factors, such as an insanely high level of inequality, lack of an equitable social safety net or public health system compared to other Western countries, legislation which favours the absolute wealthiest and elite corporates at the expense of the huge bulk of the rest of the population, which pays most of the taxes etc. Considering that this entirely intended system has been in full swing for over 40 years, its hardly surprising, is it? I would think that those grievances are completely valid.

The only trouble is as history amply demonstrates, an autocracy of the privileged and billionaires will solve none of the problems. Its completely understandable that an entire system which was set up to funnel wealth to the richest is evidently not fit-for-purpose - but autocracy is not the cure. Though it may certainly feel cathartic at the beginning.

I’m 60 and really truly horrified by what I have come to see in our country with the rise of Trump and his ilk. I’ve been a moderate democrat leaning conservative my entire life, have voted for 6 Presidents and yet truly believe we are now in the throes of a slow and systematic death of democracy.

That said, my 30-year-old son reminds me, and as you have said here, that there is no way a Trump presidency will be able to pull off a fraction of what he is saying and in 4 years. For example, the mass deportations will collapse our economy IF it can even be achieved. The amount of time, money, logistics, etc needed to pull that off is staggering.

We are a divided nation and the ugliness is just beginning. Trump supporters are rude, divisive, antagonistic, vengeful. And now they are coming out of the woodwork. My once beautiful and quiet neighborhood is speckled with professional and permanent Trump signs in yards since the election: Trump’s America with spotlights on it at night. So I can’t even go on a walk or drive home without seeing it all. No peace. 

I’m trying to be hopeful that it’s not too late to save our democracy. I’m still too gutted to think straight right now.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Yes. Agree! I’ve voted for 6 Presidents in my life and starting in 1984. So this one just hurts more than all the others because Republicans were once upon a time more decent human beings and you didn’t fear for your safety if your guy didn’t win like now. 

I agree with your plan. I’m doing the same. Reddit is all I do now and my subs are very few. Even so, I will now put on a timer daily and that will be all I do for that day. Here’s some more of my care strategies:

-Pick one cause and focus only locally. For me that is public education.

-No more MSM or nightly news. I will not look at the rapist’s / pedophile’s face or listen to his voice. I will not become mentally exhausted from this disgusting human. Just like I did his last Presidency it will be a visual and auditory blackout. 

-Up my spiritual game, pray, and call on America’s and the world’s better angels and stronger humans out there to fight against fascism and dictatorship. I am 60 now and my fortitude is lessening but my spiritual prowess is strengthening. I believe the world will come to our aid in ways we may not see right now. If the US falls, so does the world. Elon, Putin, Lil Kim are despised and so I have to believe they will not succeed. I believe Trump is the anti-Christ. 

-Hunker down in my own home and help raise my grand babies with my values on full display that they will remember and carry forth when I’m gone. 

-Eat healthy, exercise, rest. Repeat. Live quieter and more simply. 

-Be kind and courteous to everyone until I have a reason not to be and remove myself quickly from relationships, conversations, etc with anything to do with the darkness that is upon the USA. Protect my light. It’s smaller and not as bright as my younger years but it still shines. 

Peace and good health to you my friend. We’ll see you around here. Thank you for the kind words.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Supreme Court: presidential powers are immune (trump v United States)

Executive order - presidential power

Trump: executive order to terminate term limits for the president 

They literally laid the ground work for the executive branch to do whatever it wants. Because they gave presidential power “presumed immunity” in trump v United States, the DOJ can’t even present evidence in court of the president breaking the law because it’s presumed immune. Won’t even matter when trump dismantles the DOJ. Plus they’d have to care in the first place and he is installing a trump loyalist as attorney general",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"I don’t think it’s false hope my friend. Hope is hope and always positive. What I think is that those of us who are savvy citizens and clearly see the big picture are beyond sad and also frightened and mainly feeling unsafe right now and grasping for anything that helps us believe what we are seeing is not true. I’ve studied international politics and the rise and fall of governments and never in a million years thought America would be on the same path as Nazi Germany. 

2 years is not alot of time to see drastic changes because our country will be riding the waves still of Biden’s work. 

What concerns me most, however, is that the immediate executive orders and dismantling of agencies and such is going to be the first business and to begin the ultimate dictatorship — which is taking away free speech and the right to vote. So that when, not if, the economy plummets and healthcare and public education, for example, die by year 4 of the Trump Presidency, we won’t be able to vote anymore. 

I believe 100% that P25 People and Putin have been taking down the democracy we have always lived under for at least 10 years if not longer. Obama warned us of all of this and in his charismatic way. Hillary wrote about it in her post lost election book ‘What Happened’ and described in accurate detail where we are today.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

My family’s safety is my top concern and while the changes you describe seem inconceivable right now, I am afraid the changes to what we have known and taken for granted will be swift and catastrophic.  I am hoping for court battles to delay such sweeping changes but the Trump supporters have certainly come out of the woodwork since the election and I’m fearing it will give more confidence to the conservative judges to make decision based more on outcome than in actual law.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"Strangely, Walz has something in common with Trump in terms of appeal: he doesn’t have a politician’s filter. He talks like a normal person.

That’s not to say he’s a jerk or anything, but he comes off as very genuine in terms of his feelings, albeit in a very folksy way rather than Trump’s confident bombast. Trump and Walz don’t have that practiced formality we see in most politicians, and to some voters that might make them feel more real and appealing.

I don’t think that was as much on display as it could have been in his debate with the Bearded One. Despite being a centrist, I came away rather liking Walz even if I have some policy disagreements with progressives in general. Felt sorry to see the guy lose.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"His appeal is that he lies and MAGA is dumb enough to believe it.

You can't lie to liberals. Not this liberal base, which is generally college-educated and knows how to fact check.

One think Trump does do that I think is genuinely appealing is that he connects with his audience. Both Obama and Bill Clinton had this talent as well. I struggle to draw comparisons to Trump and the other two presidents. But perception is nine-tenths of reality.

I think it would be valuable for the next Democratic nominee to be really frank. Don't worry about being a little off-color or candid. Voters have proven they have a huge tolerance for off-color. Perhaps too much so. And Democrats REALLY need to allow their candidate to do this and not get offended if he (and it will probably be a he) says something that isn't PC. I'm not saying to out-trump Trump. But I am saying try to come off a little more off-scripted and genuine.

Walz himself did a good job of this, actually. He's always been like that as a governor (never used a prompter until he was introduced in Philly). We need more Dems to take up that sort of style.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"I think one of the biggest weapons the right has is their portrayal of masculinity.  Let's be real for a minute here.  I will start by saying that I'm 100% for inclusion and equality, but in the current landscape, it almost seems like we're trying to overcorrect for our past wrongs.  It's not totally uncommon to speak badly of straight white men.  A lot of these young male voters grew up seeing the country try so hard to bring up women and minorities, that I could see where they will feel like they've been left behind.  On top of this, the right has portrayed themselves as ""manly"" men which a lot of men and young men want to be identified with.  I enjoy being manly.  When I fix something around the house, I let out the deep ""oh oh oh"" that you'd see Tim Allen do in Home Improvement. What I'll say sets me apart from a lot of the right, is that I understand manliness is also uplifting those around you and helping those who need it when you are able to. I know this is probably an unpopular opinion.  I still want to reiterate, I am 100% for the uplifting of women and minorities and trying to correct the lack of inclusion we've seen in the past.  I've seen first hand little girls of color who were sad because they weren't one of the ""pretty white girls"" that they'd see on TV and movies.  I just feel like we also shouldn't be alienating men from conversations and treating them like they are only given opportunities because of their race and/or gender.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

You don't have to feel bad about what happens to people that aren't white, because Trump says they deserve what's coming, they're vermin, they're bad and white people have the right to 'protect' their white nationalist dominant culture.

Fuck, Biden was the only president to ever picket with union members, and most union members turned around and voted for a guy (Trump) who is anti-Union! Make that make sense.

Here’s all of the technical statistics that show it’s fine.” Far too often democrats come across as out of touch technocrats who think the most important thing is to have a detailed policy plan. Policies don’t win elections. Vibes win elections. Stories win elections. Trump was able to put together a story for the state of country that people bought into, and they didn’t buy into the story the Democrats were trying to tell.

I think that any Democratic strategist who doesn’t understand why they’re losing the working class vote to Trump, or think it’s because they’re dumb or racist or sexist or whatever, or thinks they just need to do a better job explaining their policies in more detail, or thinks that there’s nothing wrong and there’s no changes needed, should quit their jobs.

I think she had a good strategy of focusing on hope (or joy as she called it), and de-empowering/emasculating Trump by labeling Trump a ""weirdo"" and ""unserious man"" instead of a threat. 

Problem is that unlike Obama, she didn't have any actual change planned (no universal health care plan), and she never had any charisma or eloquence. So when she got asked on The View if she would have done something differently from Mr. Biden, she said: ""There is not a thing that comes to mind.""

That, and her subsequent refusal to ever propose concrete substantial change, pretty much killed her message of hope.

Then later on she inexplicably decided to abandon the ""unserious weirdo"" line of attack, and instead went back to a Hillary strategy of labelling Trump a threat to democracy and courting republican women.

"They’ve already expanded vertically into their own batteries I believe. And, they’re sort of at a crossroads in profitability that prevents significant expansion. They can refine processes in their current plant to produce more, but they’ve already shelved expansion (into Georgia I believe) in favor of capital conservation.

“Made in America” and “More affordable” are going to be tough. Their R1 series retail at ~$80k. The R2 is planned for the 40-50k range, which may help.

For whatever reason, the R1 series doesn’t qualify for a full rebate which is a competitive challenge. The R2 should also address this. I also believe Elon is further aiming at those rebates though.

And the last point can be tuned, but Rivian already owns much of their vertical capabilities.

Point of this post is to add context that Rivian is highly managed and they have comprehensively addressed your suggestions. I do however think tariffs could be a significant challenge to longevity.

They’re currently losing 40+ thousand dollars for every vehicle they sell, and possess one major partner in Amazon. Their capacity to ramp up production is somewhat limited by this.

I honestly think the best move for their survival is to hunker down and consider expanding horizontally as a more formal manufacturer EV offering. They do have like $(5 or 9)bn in liquid assets, but I have to imagine they are not too amped. heh

I'd actually say it has far more to do with just how awful men are at sex.

>In her indelible essay “The female price of male pleasure,” Lili Loofbourow points to the chasm between what men and women define as “bad sex” to illuminate this basic fact of modern culture: if men find a sexual encounter boring or unsatisfying, they call it “bad”.

>For women, though, “bad sex” almost always involves considerable pain and/or violence. As Loofbourow puts it, “[W]e live in a culture that sees female pain as normal and male pleasure as a right.” And that dynamic: that we accept that women’s suffering as an immutable fact – like the weather – that we cannot control but can only predict, is the very thing that makes women seem hysterical and overreacting when we speak up about it.  https://archive.ph/KPes2",2024_11_10,06_45_08

“This is a clear violation of FEMA’s core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation,” FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said in a statement. “This was reprehensible.”

The National Retail Federation released a report on this. Key sectors are going to see cost increases and therefore price increases to shoppers/consumers.

Basically, for Apparel, Appliances, Footwear, Toys, Travel Goods, and to a lesser extent Furniture, expect prices to go up. Electronics is a big one that will be hit too. And that's just the sectors they covered.

There are additional sectors that this report does not cover. For instance, think of plumbers, electricians, general contractors/builders and their materials.... their costs are going up to, so they'll get it and so might their customers.

There's also counter tariffs, which will, once again, crush our farmers.

The democrats don't deserve another chance at this point, we deserve another choice that will represent real, working Americans and families as effectively as the republicans have represented white,  rich, and evangelical Americans.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Remember that when Trump put tariffs on China, China countered with some, including soybeans which royally fucked US farmers (soybean exports from the US dropped 75%, it is our largest agricultural export). [Trump had to bail them out, which cost more than maintaining the navy fleet or our nuclear arsenal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2020/01/21/trump-tariff-aid-to-farmers-cost-more-than-us-nuclear-forces/), then he campaigned on saving them from a problem he created (left out that he caused it on the campaign trail however). 

As said, if the goal was to actually bolster domestic production over outsourcing of labor, there are plenty of regulatory actions a functioning government could take. You may have heard that Trump also is flirting with the idea of no income tax - it may surprise you to learn that “no income tax and tariffs” is actually something the USA has had before, it is referred to as the Gilded Age, where government revenue was generated largely by tariffs the working class ultimately paid large portions of their income to cover, while it barely affected the wealthy, leading to extreme income inequality (that’s why it’s called the Gilded Age, all the gold crusted at the top).

History tells us that the move to tariffs and the elimination of the income tax will lead to greater wealth inequality and a disproportionate burden placed on the working class to generate government revenue, Trump tells us it’s to bring jobs back from overseas. It’s worth noting that even if this supposed plan worked, it would be years before factories would be up and running, while the working class deals with the tariffs and counter-tariffs, with no guarantees the elimination of the income tax will even happen.

Based on what you’ve said I imagine we are on different ends of the political spectrum brother, but my mindset has shifted to one of preparation at this point, so my advice would be to save what money you can, don’t take any long term financial commitments that are unnecessary, and see how it plays out. If it’s all what Trump claims it is then you can say I told you so later, but I would urge you to prepare for what history says it is.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"In complete honesty even if manufacturing did move back here we wouldn’t see the middle class grow. The wages and benefits that workers got pre-Reagan won’t be returning. Otherwise how would the rich profit. 

Surely someone must think of the billionaires (/s)",2024_11_10,06_45_08
What made America strong with a middle class was the aftermath of WW2 and America's position as the only country in the world that came out relatively unscathed.,2024_11_10,06_45_08
"This isn't at all how it will play out.  

I work in industrial production in America, for one of the largest American companies out there.  

This is going to eliminate the middle class (what little of it there is left).  These American based companies don't give a flying fuck about the people doing the work.  They care about shareholders and their own bonuses.  They also don't look beyond 2 years out for *anything*.  There is going to be zero investment in the infrastructure to stop sourcing materials from abroad because it does not provide any short term gains.  All that is going to happen is that they are going to jack their prices up on their products.  Nothing else is going to change.

You're assuming that the tariffs will result in a buildup of American infrastructure to have everything made here, but that isn't going to happen.  What it *is* going to do is raise the price on everything and also give the companies a reason to lower wages as well as the number of employees.  

People will make less money and goods will cost more.  The profits will go to the top and stay there.

When *every* company is focused on short term profits there is no other path that is realistic.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"And how many manufacturing facilities were built and staffed as a result of those tariffs?  If you didn't have a number then I have to assume it's a very very low number.  If that's the case we pay more and everything stays offshore, making it pointless and harmful.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Maybe if we spent the next decade or two completely developing US farming, mine, infrastructure, and education we could get to like 90% independent because, wouldn't you know, we still would be unable to meet our needs with materials like nickle, platinum, or many of the rare earth metals.

"Okay, so where are we going to get the labor to staff these low margin good factories? You really haven’t thought this through have you.

"It’s based on Plato’s own ideas, though. You’re right, but he was basically reiterating his master’s teachings.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"‘Instead, Aristotle favored governments which held a mix between oligarchic and democratic policies. He called this ideal balance politeia, usually translated as “polity” or “constitution.” This imagined government would be predictably characterized by its moderation. For example, Aristotle argued that the ideal citizen for a mixed government did not come from the rich or poor, but the middle class. That is, he thought that the very rich and the very poor were susceptible to extremism and political dissent, in contrast to the moderate middle class. Consequently, Aristotle’s politeia was the best because it was stable and free of civil strife.’

Whereas Plato was much more anti-democratic.  He wanted a birth determined class of philosopher kings to rule the republic and for few others to have a say.",2024_11_10,06_45_08
"For regular people and small groups, there's all kinds everywhere all the time. I'm not saying that some are nice or wanted by most. But all societies have a mix of different ways of life. It's what allows the things that you and I consider to be good and normal to exist too. 

If America had stayed accepting of differences of opinion, we wouldn't have been fighting for reproductive rights. What really counts is who is at the helm. The administration that governs over us. Because that's who makes it illegal to want to live a certain way. That's who had been (and will continue to shortly) striking down on women's liberties in a way that makes people who feel a certain way no longer a valid part of society. 

What I'm saying is that there'll never be a utopia. Chasing purity is problematic even if intentions started out as good. What's needed is a government that rules lawfully and with best intentions of humanity in mind.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"I wouldn’t say you were wrong, though, it’s just Aristotle’s whole system of ethics was about finding the balance between extremities so there was a perfection. I recommend learning about the Nicomachean Ethics - I try to live my life by most of his principles. An example is that someone may be a glutton, but they also should not give up eating entirely to become famished. It seems simplistic but all of the rules balance together to create the perfect citizen.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

"The second Biden would have even hinted towards using anything that would have used ""Trumps"" ruling against him, Bidens entire family would have been hunted by these lunatics. I am sure they would've hit their mark, too. 

Remember, nothing that they believe can be said and used against them. We do it anyway on principle alone. 

Even now, they've been bitching and whining for nearly 4 years about Biden and saying disgusting things about Kamala, but the very things they said about them is the exact shit that Trump is accused of (in a court of law even) and if its thrown in their face, since there is legitimate proof/evidence of Trumps behavior, they don't know anything about it, its  ""fake news""... Yet when we express the reality of what his victory will cost us, not because the majority of us is saying fraud, we are the ""whining liberals"" and etc.. The election was less than a week ago. They can whine for nearly 4 years, but we don't even get to be angry for a week? They destroyed Biden with jokes about his age.... & rambling, but when Trump became the fossil, with Kamala legitimately being sane and educated, they ignored Trumps BS and ramblings and said Kamala slept her way up the top... etc. One supporter who was enlightened about his SA case, said ""at least it wasn't murder."" Course when she was asked about Marjorie T. Green, she said, ""I don't care to know Bidens people."" 🤣 Straight idiot. 

They're SICK mfs.... Bidens' legacy will barely survive once his term is over. There is no way he would survive after using his immunity powers. We wouldn't want him to anyway. All he has is his integrity. I wouldn't want him losing that, which would make something he would have in common with Trump. 

I get it, but even if Biden had done even better than he did, Trump would have tripled down on the hate, and that hate would've been extra mutated through his followers... Trump will forever blame him. He couldn't even let it go that Biden had dropped out of the race. He kept bringing him up every chance he could because that is what his campaign was based on. Hell, he even said vice presidents aren't even important, yet he attacked Kamala for not doing ""important"" things... Then, remember Trump promoted vaccines for COVID? He even said he got his vaccine when he got COVID! He brags about how much he invested in them. Yet, why did his followers shift the vaccine grievances onto Biden? It's sad and sickening. They don't care about that either.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

Name one president that has done more for this country than Biden. He was so successful, even the republicans were taking credit for what he, Joe Biden, did. But we still have a population who are unwilling to even acknowledge this. There is no way ANY president could have resolved all the issues we as a country have in one term. Not happening.

Nor is people being held accountable for their actions and the consequences thereof in any way fascism. For your erudition, here's the textbook definition from the American Heritage Dictionary:

> A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, a capitalist economy subject to stringent governmental controls, violent suppression of the opposition, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism.

There's nothing 'violent' about giving a person accused of crimes a fair trial, and, if convicted by a jury of their peers, for a judge to meter out a punishment consistent with the laws violated.",2024_11_10,06_45_08

I’ve long had proof of the right doing it- I used to watch the O’Reilly factor with my dad (who was hate watching, for sure) and I then I had a boss for a few years during Obama’s first term that was big on reading right wing conspiracy blogs. It’s clear as day what they are manufacturing, and what they are leaving out in their presentations. 

At some point my dad swapped to watching MSNBC, and I started to notice him believe in clear misinformation, or partial information stories that conformed to what he already believed. I’ve fallen for a few myself- and while I had always had in my mind the feeling that both sides were manipulating me, I felt above the manipulation from the side I agreed with. Not all of what I believed was true, and one of my tenets (edited an auto correct) is that I want to find the actual truth.

I think at the very core of the problem, both sides currently have very little understanding of what the average voter on the other side thinks or believes or what their core values are. We need to be discussing the core values of America and shaping policy and opinions from there going forward.
