"In 2016, shortly after the election, Trump sat down for an interview with 60 Minutes, his first major interview as then President-elect.

Interestingly enough, this was also the last time I personally heard his voice until this election cycle, mostly because I'm capable of reading transcripts and can't stand listening to him speak, but that's neither here nor there.

During this interview he reflected on the feeling he had in the closing weeks of his campaign, addressing packed rallies and feeling the wave of support and commented that he remembered thinking, ""this doesn't feel like losing.""

This is easily the most cogent thing I've ever seen Trump communicate, but that is also neither here nor there.

Do packed rallies, not just for Harris but for her campaign surrogates across battleground states and a national address in DC attended by somewhere between 75,000 and 100,000 people feel like losing?

Does stumbling over trash in a political stunt to a half-empty venue after alienating a huge voting block just days prior feel like winning?

"**Presenting: Grapelander's guide to not dooming about random cherrypicked high turnout rural counties in Georgia!**

There are three illusions at play in Georgia rural county turnout numbers: 

The first, many of these counties are suffering from population decay. If there's a difference in the rate at which people in general are leaving the county, and the rate at which reliable voters are, you can get counties that look like this:

2020: 10,000 registered voters, 5,000 voted, 50% turnout

2024: 8,000 registered voters, 4,500 voted. 56% turnout. 

But this can get reported as *112% of 2020's turnout already! Oh no, rurals exploding! Democrats in shambles!* by people who want you to believe that Georgia is screwed. Even though the actual raw vote numbers show fewer people voting. 

The second, on the opposite end of the spectrum, are republican leaning counties that have had huge population growth. On the surface, this seems bad. And it can be reported badly, [like this](https://x.com/cookoutEnjoyer/status/1852418864711381403). ""*Oh no, this rural Trump-dominated county has already outvoted 2020! Disaster*."" Forsyth County and a lot of the Atlanta exurbs are super prone to this. 

However....this is almost entirely down to population growth. These areas are exploding. That county has 3000 more registered voters than they did last time. And the incoming voters aren't necessarily following the trends of the county's historical voting record. [Take a look at the 2016-2020 swing map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Georgia#/media/File:Georgia_County_Swing_2020.svg) before jumping to conclusions on republican counties with growth. It may not be as bad as feared, and in many cases may in fact end up being a net margin gain for democrats. 

Notice that lots of Georgia early vote dooming and republican victory laps are reliant on cherry-picked outlier counties with data selectively reported in one of these two ways, depending on which one fits the narrative. 

Finally, the rural counties are mostly seeing dramatically higher numbers of 2020 election day voters shifting to early voting than the ruban ones are. This [extends to the racial breakdown as well](https://x.com/stphnfwlr/status/1852000284622406107). Democrats are preserving more of their likely election day vote. And some of the dem strongholds driven by the black vote that seem lagging (Clayton, Richmond, Chatham) all had *very* high election day turnout in 2020. All 3 are on pace to meet or exceed 2020 turnout if they can pull a similar election day rate. Some of the Atlanta metro counties are on pace to crush it, and/or project to see further margin gains by democrats. 

We're going to win Georgia.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Calling it now:

The stories of the election 

- Women make up a much larger share of the electorate that the 52/48 they did in 2020.  This led to an over sample of men in polls and an overweighting towards men and therefore Trump
- A significant amount of Trump 2020 voters were so disgusted by Jan 6 they don’t even admit to voting for him anymore.  This caused recall weight votes to underweight the impact of Republican defections.  This led to an overweighting of Trump support in recall vote polls.

>The race for control of the U.S. House remains as close as it’s ever been. 
>
>The battleground is confined to a few dozen seats, with neither party having a clear advantage in a majority of seats. And with several competitive races in West Coast states that take longer to count their ballots, it’s highly possible we won’t know which party has control on election night.
>
> At the moment, Republicans hold 221 seats to Democrats’ 214. 
> 
> In our final House race ratings, Democrats are favored in 205 seats, while Republicans are favored in 208, leaving 22 seats in the Toss Up column. If the Toss Ups split down the middle, Republicans would maintain their majority by an even narrower 219 to 216 seat margin.
> 
> Though Republicans are favored in a few more seats, they also have a lower ceiling, since they’re defending more competitive territory. If Republicans sweep the Toss Ups, they’d pick up nine seats, while if Democrats sweep the Toss Ups they would pick up 13 seats.

This is going to directly hurt his chances of winning the election...and thus hurt his chances of staying out of prison.

It has the added benefit of sucking away money from down ballot races, and thus reducing the number (and perhaps the willingness) of elected Republicans able to try to pull some sort of shenanigans to get him off.

It is much safer, whether in terms of literal self-interest or purely psychologically, to find a close race than to gamble on a clear Harris victory.

At the same time, the 2016 and 2020 polling misfires shattered many pollsters’ confidence in their own methods and data. When their results come in very blue, they don’t believe it. And frankly, I share that same feeling: If our final Pennsylvania poll comes in at Harris +7, why would I believe it?

https://xcancel.com/voterstomorrow/status/1852437650457640976?s=46

According to our projected youth early vote turnout benchmarks, which are based on 2022 voting preference rates, young voters nationally have blown past their early vote turnout projection by 20%.

Projection Chart of youth turnout in PA, MI, NC, GA & National - https://xcancel.com/voterstomorrow/status/1852437651934126526?s=46

Beyond projections, data from across the country shows young voters are on track to break youth voter turnout records.

Data from the Georgia Secretary of State shows voters 18-24 years old having cast more early votes (approx. 225,000) than those aged 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39.

https://xcancel.com/voterstomorrow/status/1852437653888594406?s=46

On top of that, our team of chapters and organizers has:
- hosted over 100 actions on campuses to help register young voters
- helped over 50,000 voters access critical voting information
- made over 19 million texts and calls to young people, helping them create voting plans

"Meidas Touch, Recap of Today in Politics, 11/1/24  
… A showdown is brewing in FL as DOJ informs the state that they intend to send in election monitors, with Desantis responding immediately that the federal monitors will not be allowing inside polling locations. Nothing like this has happened in America since the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s. Expect this to be litigated on an emergency basis immediately.

… Desantis’s Secretary of State Cord Byrd said that “the presence of federal law enforcement inside polling places would be counterproductive and could potentially undermine confidence in the election.” The confidence in GOP dominance everywhere in FL maybe.… Hopefully the case will not be assigned to Aileen Cannon.

... Mike Johnson pledged to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act which has been praised and credited by REPUBLICAN elected officials all over the country for the high tech, well paying jobs it is creating while expanding the US lead in tech with competing countries that have been rapidly catching up… This comes one day after he was caught on a hot mic pledging to repeal Obamacare.

… MI Gov Gretchen Whitmer responded that killing the CHIPS Act would be “a complete disaster for thousands of Michigan workers relying on the jobs that this legislation provides.

… Liz Cheney called on George W. Bush today to break his silence and endorse Harris: “I can’t explain why George W. Bush hasn’t spoken out, but I think it’s time, and I wish that he would.”

… The US Supreme Court has rejected an emergency appeal from Republicans attempting to prevent thousands of provisional ballots from being counted. Trump’s favorite legal analyst Jonathan Turley was critical of the decision.

… Trump went on several more unhinged, deranged rants in his appearance with Tucker Carlson last night. At one point he criticized Liz Cheney’s past foreign policy decisions and said that she should be forced to stand in front of 9 enemy soldiers with guns pointed at her face.

… Arizona AG Kris Mayes said she is investigating Trump’s comments as a possible crime: “I have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under AZ law.”

… Trump also called President Biden “a stupid bastard” and VP Harris “a sleaze bag.”

… Harris Senior Advisor Ian Sams: “Trump is talking about sending a prominent Republican to a firing squad. VP Harris is talking about sending one to her Cabinet.”

… Liz Cheney responded: “This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant.”

… Harris made a statement to the press about Trump’s remarks: “He has increased his violent rhetoric about political opponents and in great detail, suggested rifles should be trained on former representative Liz Cheney. This must be disqualifying.”

… Last June, Trump reposted a Truth Social post that said that Cheney was guilty of “treason” and called for her to be given a televised trial before a military tribunal.   
  
… The FBI received a referral to investigate Mike Lindell’s ‘Election Crime Bureau’ after the group sent emails to elections workers asking them personal questions about their background and employment. Lindell told ABC: “I want to get rid of the electronic voting machines and you should care about it too. There’s nothing wrong with the survey.” We will see if the FBI agrees.

… Trump also claimed that he had 107,000 people at his NJ rally, 101,000 people at his PA rally, and 114,000 people at Coachella. Not even remotely close for the congenital liar.

… Senior Harris campaign officials told WaPo that their internal data shows that they are winning late deciders in battleground states by over 10 points, with most of them citing Trump’s insane and racist rally at MSG as their reason for deciding on Harris.

… Harris Senior Advisor David Plouffe: “It’s helpful, from experience (Obama 2012), to be closing a presidential campaign with late deciding voters breaking by double digits to you and the remaining undecideds looking more friendly to you than you opponent.”

… GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says that there is a coordinated campaign on right-wing social media to spread fake videos and disinformation about the election in GA and he believes that Russia is the source of it. The most egregious video was from a man who claimed he was a migrant from Haiti and voted illegally in the election for Harris.… The Office of the Director of National Intelligence then issued a statement that the videos did, in fact, originate in Russia.

… Bannon had Scott Presler on where they complained that long lines at polling places in a heavy Republican area of PA was “voter suppression,” which has been the Democratic position for years. Bannon: “How is a working class person supposed to go and wait 5+ hours to vote?”

… Stephen Miller was melting down all day on Twitter, making panicked post after panicked post. He started off in the morning ranting about media coverage of Trump’s Cheney comments.

The conditions of his bail were as follows…

https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/21/politics/read-trump-bond-agreement/index.html

Of particular interest…

> 4) The Defendant shall perform no act to intimidate any person known to him or her to be a codefendant or witness in this case or to otherwise obstruct the administration of justice. Id. 
> 
> This shall include, but is not limited to, the following: 
> 
> a. The Defendant shall make no direct or indirect threat of any nature against any codefendant; 
> 
> b. The Defendant shall make no direct or indirect threat of any nature against any witness including, but not limited to, the individuals designated in the Indictment as an unindicated co-conspirators Individual 1 through Individual 30; 
> 
> c. The Defendant shall make no direct or indirect threat of any nature against any victim; 
> 
> d. The Defendant shall make no direct or indirect threat of any nature against the community or to any property in the community; 
> 
> e. The above shall include, but are not limited to, posts on social media or reposts of posts made by another individual on social media;

18 U.S.C. § 373 is the felony Trump has committed.

It is a felony under federal law to intentionally ""solicit, command, induce or otherwise endeavor to persuade"" another person to engage in a crime of violence against a person or property.

Trump has committed that crime for recommending that someone shoot nine guns at Liz Cheney.

And, as a result, also violated conditions of bail.

"Let’s talk about this “GEORGIA RURAL SURGE” narrative that’s driving me crazy.

Why?

Because it’s not just wrong - it’s doing a massive disservice to Georgia voters. 🧵

First up: The data are being misread. 

These rural counties aren’t showing a surge - their population is growing and they hardly vote on Election Day.

They’re basically done voting now.

That’s it.

Meanwhile, the REAL story? 

Places like Clayton County, with large Black populations, and Fulton County are in track to EXCEED their 2020 turnout!

But if it happens, it’ll be on Election Day.

Here’s what’s infuriating:

The “rural surge” narrative will stick in people’s minds, while the actual surge in Black and urban turnout will get lost in the Election Day noise.

Bottom line: This isn’t just about getting the numbers wrong.

It’s about fairness. It’s about accurately representing ALL Georgia voters - not just the ones who vote early.

Let’s get the story right 🍑

"This is a nice article from NYT that talks about how partisan migration has happened since 2020, Dems moving mostly into Biden-won states and Republicans doing the opposite. Long-term it's a worrying trend for the state of the nation as the polarization and gulf between the states continues to grow rapidly as a result. But for the current election, this might provide a clue about how the final results shake out. This indicates why AZ for example will be tough for Harris, and NC will come down to turnout. For all the other swing states, it's encouraging for her-

Holy shit.  Like, if you're going to put $30MM on the line - maybe, *just maybe* you can take a few grand of that, hire a polling consultant to explain to you how pollsters have adjusted their methodology since 2020, why 2016 and 2020 polling results are a terrible heuristic for wagering so much money on a Trump win, the unpredictability of polling misses, etc.

It isn't about the Cheney's or Bushes being in line with Kamala politically nor influencing her policies.  It's the fact that Trump and the MAGA GOP are undemocratic and fascist.  Cheney's intent is to motivate the non-MAGA Republicans and right leaning independents to vote for the Democrats.

Bush just let Cheney run the show and Cheney was evil and competent enough to actually enact evil policy.

We already know he and his wife do not support Trump.

It’s the right thing to do, and it would be incredibly impactful for Trump to not have any support of any living President, but in his particular circumstance it’s hard not to at least understand his position and mindset.

All that said, I did say ***""ALMOST always""***.  In this case, DJT is trying to tear this country to pieces.  That's literally his agenda.  He wants us killing each other so that he doesn't have to go to jail.  The things he has said in the past month are so un-American, unconstitutional, evil, and scary as hell.  In this particular case, weighing in would be Bush's attempt to preserve the thing he has been trying to protect.

These are strange times. It's completely insane that we have a fascist this close to the White House, and a Congress and Supreme Court willing to do his bidding.  I don't think any of Trump's comments are hyperbole.  I think he fully intends to surround himself with people who will not tell him ""no.""  Then I think he's going to start rounding up Americans.  He will put us into smaller groups and then demonize each group sequentially until this country is run solely by fear of his reprisal.  The terminology he uses is identical to how Kim Jong-Un runs North Korea.

If I get started on my opinions of the Patriot Act, I'll be typing half the night. He also ensured we will always be behind in stem cell research by only allowing existing lines to be used. 

I don't think he was a good president. I think he did real harm, and we have not recovered. Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, and others were as embarrassing as Bush himself. I'm trying to think of him as a human being who hasn't held office in nearly 2 decades. If he can use his influence to actually do good, then I hope he does. He owes the country at least that much.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"That is not how federal removal procedure works. The PA judge didn't ""grant"" removal to federal court. 

Once a Notice of Removal is filed in federal court, the case is automatically removed as a procedural matter. Jurisdiction instantly transfers to the federal court. The federal court judge assigned to the case then has the inherent authority to accept jurisdiction or remand the case back to the state court it originated from.

This was a frivolous removal and that is absolutely clear given the federal court's unusually quick remand of jurisdiction.

Edit: to be clear, Musk was absolutely not required to attend Court because the removal filing stripped the state court of jurisdiction. He did not need to show up. But I am frustrated by the fact that absolutely zero journalists covering this story have properly explained the procedural mechanics of federal removal.

As a Floridian, I’m not sure how much of an impact the Puerto Rican vote will have in my state - but I’m positive this is representative of other Puerto Ricans in other areas of the country and in states which are more in play and vital to the election outcome.

Pennsylvania has around 473,000 Puerto Rican residents, according to the Census Bureau’s 2022 American Community Survey.

"97% of respondents say they’ll vote.

Biden is estimated to have gotten 68% of Ricans in 2020. If we use the same turnout number (and it’s prob lower?) that’s about 694,000.

Going with the PR population of 1.2 million in Florida and we are looking at almost 990,000 voters. 

That’s a difference of 296,000 and that’s being conservative cause I think Hinchcliffes comments will drive more Rican turnout overall this time versus last time. 

Trump won Florida by ~372k votes in 2020. 

So this won’t close the gap entirely but it helps a lot.  And Of course polls have errors and the sample is small. Can’t actually assume that 97% will vote.

"[Fake video of Georgia voter fraud is Russian misinformation, US officials say](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/01/georgia-voter-fraud-video-fake-russia/75993122007/)


Friday’s disclosure follows the ODNI’s public attribution of three other fake videos in recent weeks to Russia. They included one falsely accusing Harris of paralyzing a teenage girl in a hit and run and another falsely accusing her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, of sexual abuse.

A third fake video made and circulated by Russia purported to show pro-Harris voters illegally ripping up Trump mail-in ballots in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, an ODNI official said.

“This Russian activity is part of Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans,” ODNI said. It was the latest of several election updates warning Americans of what it describes as “foreign malign influence operations.”

The Elon Musk factor
The video is the latest salvo in an intensifying Kremlin campaign to smear Vice President Harris and boost what intelligence officials say is Vladimir Putin’s preferred candidate, former President Donald Trump, in the waning days of the razor-close Nov. 5 election.

[Investigating Musk’s far-fetched claim about Democrats importing voters](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd5l0d3794o)


Since endorsing Donald Trump for president in July, Elon Musk - the owner of X - has posted about the US election hundreds of times, attracting more than four billion views.
BBC Verify, working with data firm Node XL, analysed all of his posts since then - over 8,000 - and searched for key words to track the election issues he has been posting about most to his 200 million followers.
Immigration and voting emerge as key themes with Mr Musk engaging with misinformation online about “illegal aliens” voting in this election.
He has also claimed repeatedly that Democrats have been “importing” immigrants who will vote for them in future elections.

Among the narratives being pushed in the community is one that has become a pet conspiracy theory of Musk’s. The SpaceX CEO has loudly and oftenmade the false claim that the Biden administration was “importing voters” in the form of “unvetted illegal immigrants”. In the last few days, a Musk-funded super Pac has been pushing a fake pro-Kamala Harris initiative called Project 2028. The initiative has posted fake pro-Harris ads and sent texts to voters that include claims that Harris will be opening the country’s borders and is pushing for undocumented immigrants to be able to vote. Non-citizens are not allowed to vote in the US, and there is no available evidence they are voting in droves as claimed. Users in the community are sharing videosthey say provides evidence that Democrats are “bussing” undocumented immigrants to cast votes in their favor.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

\- He accused Democrats of promoting dishonesty and moral decay in society, despite his own controversial past. 

\- The ad has sparked outrage among conservatives, highlighting the ongoing culture wars in the lead-up to the 2024 election.

And raping your wife wasn't a crime.

Also they couldn't have a bank account, get loans, or do much of anything without a man giving permission.  So yes they got married whether they liked it or not, whether they were a lesbian or not because there really was pretty much no other choice.

He can realistically lay claim to having had the most influence on what the Republican Party has become: an anti-compromise, angry, zealous cabal that seeks only domination via division.

"This.

When Newt Gingrich became House speaker, he told his new members not to bring their families to Washington. Prior to his tenure, it was common for lawmakers from both parties—and their families—to spend time together outside of work hours. Card games, family events, steak dinners… they knew one another and *liked* one another on a personal level.

He wanted all that to end because it led to people working together and compromising with one another, which is the antithesis of his brand of politics. He wanted his members to *hate* the other side.

A line can easily be drawn from Newt Gingrich to those two cowards, John Boehner and Paul Ryan, both of whom could not even bring themselves to *use* the word compromise when they had the top House position. Boehner famously refused during an interview to say it, prompting the interviewer to notice and point out how absurd it was by pressing him as he uncomfortably tried to avoid the word.

These things matter. It all led to a breakdown of civility and respect for longstanding norms that kept our government functioning, and that led to the Republican Party opening the door to a tyrant when he came knocking. Oh, sure, Paul Ryan hates MAGA today (just this week I saw someone remembered he exists and asked him to comment), but that’s only because they torched his pathetic career and made a joke of him. Had he been able to control them the way he and McConnell had hoped they might, he’d be singing a different tune (and so would McConnell).",2024_11_02,05_26_36

All this fear and info that’s been in the spotlight recently about just how recently women were still very much subject to their husbands has been eye opening. And I’m almost 40! 

It’s like intellectually I knew about all the progress women had in the 1900s - getting the right to vote, to divorce, own property, have credit cards, Roe v wade,… but like all kids, things that happened 20 years ago were ancient history. I was also very privileged to have extremely liberal parents - they were executive woodsy hippies, without the pot or free love. So I was relatively insulated from gender norms growing up, so I was never subjected to a lot of “women should be subservient” bullshit. Also I’m probably autistic so I was oblivious to a lot, socially. 

It’s wild to think I was 2yo when women got the right to their own credit cards. That when my parents got married mom *couldn’t* own property solely in her name. Divorce didn’t seem as big a deal because there were several in my great grandparents generation - you don’t fuck with the Irons family women.

You know it the other way because misogynist pastors only focus on submission of wives to husbands.

Im not saying that the Bible isn't also rife with misogyny.  Structuring a marriage with the husband as a symbolic Christ is a setup for failure and exploitation (of women).

"Polls are polls, and every eligible voter, if they already haven't, should educate themselves on how to read polls, how to identify pollsters and their methodologies, their sampling methods, participant demographics, any inherent flaws and biases, the wording and structure of questions, whose funding them, the pollster's credibility, so on and so forth.

Also, this should go without saying, but a ""snap poll"" conducted by Elon Musk on Twitter, doesn't even fall into the category of a legitimate poll. Musk has carried out a few of these kinds of ""polls,"" while in one post he even had the audacity to call his Twitter poll ""super unscientific."" But that did not stop conservatives from taking it seriously, even sharing it across social media. This is a perfect example of poll *and* media illiteracy. 

That being said, I think the result of this race, which continues to be touted as one of the tightest in recent memory, will come down to one of two things, or both for that matter.

1. Who and how many registered/likely voters will choose to not show up to vote this election
2. Who and how many registered/likely voters will be disenfranchised this election. Or in other words, won't have a choice.

When it comes to the former, I think Harris will benefit from a greater percentage of never Trumpers, disillusioned former Trump voters, moderates and Haley supporters, and so called ""RINOs"" who are either put off by Trump and his downballot allies, or simply don't want to vote for the guy who the Republican party has made frontrunner three elections in a row.

I'm also of the opinion that there are quite a few potential voters who might not turn out for Trump, but will gladly or even half-heartedly tell pollsters that they would vote for him.

When it comes to number 2, Republicans across the country have been exploiting Trump's ""big lie"" for the past four years to sow distrust in our elections, granting themselves the opportunity (or excuse) to implement various voter suppression measures in battleground states. These are bills and measures that not only seek to excessively purge rolls, disqualify certain voters, throw out ballots and make the voting process more tedious, but they also afford Republicans more power, authority and supervision over our election system.

I'm talking about Republican state election officials with the unilateral power to contest or even deny the results of the election, with the power to implement last minute rule changes, the authority to throw out votes based on flimsy rationale or even said rule changes.

I'm talking about laws that make it easier for Republican state officials to cast doubt on the results and even claim fraud based on conjecture, phone in voter fraud hotlines, constituent's anecdotes, widespread election denying fervor, etc...

And I'm also talking about Republicans preparing to mount exhaustive legal battles if the results don't turn out as expected.

It's fucked up, but I think this election comes down to the difference between the number of potential Trump voters who choose not to show up to the polls, versus the number of potential Harris voters who don't have a choice in having their vote go uncounted.

And yes, it's unfortunate that this election and elections of the past have/will be decided by low propensity voters. That's the nature of the game, and I think it says a lot about how fragile our democracy can be.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

>Today’s **Democrat Party** is trying to rig elections and pack the courts because they have given up on Democracy.

>They don’t believe they can win based on their ideas, so they want to game the system and legalize voter fraud to stay in power. In true Orwellian fashion, **Democrats** refer to their election rigging plans as “voting rights”. We won’t allow the **radical left** to destroy our democracy by institutionalizing dishonesty and fraud.

>Among the things the **militant left** plan to change or destroy are American history, patriotism, border security, Christianity, the nuclear family, gender, traditional morality, capitalism, fiscal responsibility, opportunity, rugged individualism, the Judeo-Christian ethic, dissent, free speech, color blindness, law enforcement, religious liberty, and private ownership of firearms.

>**The Democrat Party and their Big Tech** allies are not merely secular; they have virtually created a new religion of wokeness that is increasingly hostile toward people of faith, particularly Christians and Jews. They are determined to drive all mention of God out of public view. We will not be silenced, canceled, or told what words to use by the politically correct crowd.

"I am 100% confident of a 0% chance of any *legitimate* Trump victory for the following reasons:    
     
- Trump already lost to Biden/Harris in 2020    
- Covid disproportionately killed Trump voters   
- Trump voters skew older and many have died since 2020    
- Millions of younger people are now eligible to vote - and they skew heavily toward Harris/Walz.
- Harris/Walz is a wildly more popular ticket than Biden/Harris was. Most 'double-haters' are now enthusiastic Harris/Walz supporters.        
- Trump's insurrection, being found liable for rape, and felony convictions have driven some Republicans to vote against him. They have not attracted new voters *to* Trump
- Dozens of former Trump Admin officials have denounced Trump - which they *hadn't* done in 2020  
- Many Republicans and independents who voted for Trump in 2020 are now voting for Harris     
- RFK Jr. and Jill Stein are stealing votes from Trump anywhere they are on the ballot - more than they are taking votes from Harris.   
- Almost nobody who voted for Biden in 2020 is now voting for Trump, who has not expanded his base. 
- The Madison Square Garden debacle has even further incited negative voter sentiment and backlash against the Trump ticket.  
  
A *legitimate* Trump win is a near mathematical impossibility.   
  
Note the heavy-lifting being done by the word *legitimate*.  
  
Trump and the GOP have been actively engaged in widespread, nationwide conspiracy to commit election fraud since 2020, virtually unopposed by Biden's Justice Department under Republican sympathizer Merrick Garland. 
  
The fraud is so pervasive as to potentially overcome even a substantial lead for Harris on election day. 
  
Republicans have already announced and published their plans to obstruct local elections, confuse the process, steal ballots, burn ballot drop boxes, introduce errors, cause interminable delays, once again send fake electors with fraudulent results, and lean on corrupt judges to make unlawful rulings in their favor. 
  
In fact, the widespread, open, numerous and flagrant acts of election interference, disruption, obstruction, and fraud being committed by Republican voters and officials is providing a massive amount of evidence Democrats can use to contest any claimed Trump victory. 
  
At this point, there is ample reason to absolutely reject any Republican claims of a Trump win next week. Republicans have provided a mountain of justification for believing any such outcome is purely the result of fraud.  
  
The Harris campaign, Biden Administration, and Biden's Justice Department (though fat chance on Merrick Garland doing jack-shit) need to strenuously oppose any claims of a Trump win, raising challenges based on VERY apparent election interference/fraud/obstruction by Republican operatives nationwide. And unlike the 63 cases Trump lost in courts across the country due to a complete lack of evidence, there is TONS of evidence of Republican-led fraud in THIS cycle.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Now I feel like there are a ton of reasons people could switch to him; perception that the economy is bad and he'll somehow magically fix it, racism, and misogyny are the top ones.

"I took the time yesterday to go through numerous polls [aggregated on 538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/), basically I wanted to see what was up with sample sizes and margins of error.

What I found was interesting. Almost every poll with a <3% spread between the candidates were within the margin of error, rendering the vast majority of polls useless for making statistical inferences. More interesting, I found very few polls favoring Trump that had more than n=2000, and all were within the margin of error. 

Now, where things get interesting, there was [a poll that had Harris winning by %,](https://sites.tufts.edu/cooperativeelectionstudy/2024/10/28/ces-estimates-on-the-2024-presidential-election/) that had a sample of 78,000 people. [You can play around with the data on a bar graph here](https://cooperativeelectionstudy.shinyapps.io/prez2024pre/). It's interesting to see, out of people who reported to have voted or will certainly vote, the numbers are even more heavily leaning towards Harris. 3% going from Biden2020 to Trump2024, but 4% Trump2020 going Harris2024. And undecided/did not vote going 51/42 Harris/Trump (again, out of respondents who said they have voted or certainly will). 

Take this all with the usual statistical grain of salt, but my goal here was to cut through the noise created by 1-3% margins that don't actually mean anything. PACs can pump out statistically meaningless polling, but they still will impact the aggregate (even when weighted; those polls should be entirely disregarded imo). When you go through and compare polls that have Trump winning and polls that have Harris winning, there's a clear divide in statistical reliability between the two. That CES survey is the largest poll you'll get, by the most non-partisan organization you'll get. And it gives Harris one of the largest margins of victory of all polling.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Pollsters are starting to release their real polls now. They didn’t want to earlier because they weren’t confident in their data sets. Because of the narrative you mentioned, which lead to herding. 

Harris was okay with this, because it pushed the ground game even harder. Complacency is a huge thing too. As a UK resident, I’m sure you can relate. 

Now we are getting more complete and complimentary data. So pullers are more confident moving the numbers over. The thing is, I see +6 and think they’re actually returning +10. Allred is a good example. He’s now 45-44. But the way Cruz has been talking for weeks, those are old numbers. I expect they’re returning +4 there. 

Another pollster said he can’t do focus groups properly anymore, because he cannot find Independent women. He also says, Harris has eaten into Trumps base with women too. He said what used to be “Likely Trump” are now Independent. 

Lots of silent types out there too. That’s why this whole secret ballots stuff is being pushed. “Will my husband know who I voted for” is exploding on Google right now. I’ve seen die hard Trump base say they’re voting for Harris because they have daughters. 

You’ll start to see more representative polls like this coming out ALL weekend. They’ll call a Harris win with all the swings. But Eday will be much bigger.

The best way to thwart that is if it’s not close. If Harris wins most of the swing states then Trump’s team has to figure out how to overthrow multiple states’ elections. That helped immensely in 2020 - they had to prove Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona were all stolen and that turned out to be too much.

">In 2020 I was saying ""Who the hell is going to vote for him now that didn't in 2016!"". I was dead wrong and he received a ton more votes that election compared to 2016 (the 2nd most votes ever sickeningly enough)

I don't think that he gained supporters necessarily, just gained voters. Our country was way more politically activated in 2020 than in 2016. I didn't vote in 2016 (to my lifelong shame) but I did in 2020. The democrats didn't gain my support, I just got off my ass. I think lots of Republicans were in the same boat. People were hyped up on both sides and the numbers showed it.

I know it's anecdotal but I've seen much less enthusiasm on the right this cycle. Way less Trump signs. Way less Trump caravans. Way less red hats. Way less everything. What I've seen more of though is Harris signs. Groups of supporters on the side of the road waving Harris flags and handing out info. It feels like we rekindled the momentum when we switched to Kamala, while Republicans are just burning out.

Seeing Biden's ads about how we had the best economy every, while the majority of the non-stock owning class was getting poorer was rather tone deaf.

"Unfortunately, this comment likely won't meet the standard for a death threat.  It could then be considered as incitement to violence, but it wouldn't meet that criteria either.

Trump has lawyers who know exactly how far he can go, and in both those charges the requirements are (for good reason) very specific.

Did he specifically threaten to kill Harris?  No.  Did he make a statement that has a very real chance to incite someone to try to kill her?  Yes.  Was that statement a direct call for someone to kill her?  No.

This statement has a real chance of causing violence, but the laws are justifiably written in such a way that he cannot be prosecuted for it.  As I said, he has lawyers who know exactly what he can legally say.  People think he constantly breaks the law and gets away with it.  With the exception of ""Justice"" Cannon, he's actually just skirting the law, and laws about incitement to violence are very specific and this is not a death threat.

"Betas, eunuchs, and those who are not from military families may take issue with what Trump said which is put Cheney in a war zone where she may have guns trained on her and THEN see how much she is willing to push for more war. You may think this is threat, but it is a RHETORICAL statement. Some may be too dense to understand or simply too partisan to believe.

Those who serve in the military, or are from military families along with anyone who is able and willing to protect others with their life understand fully and completely what Trump was saying in his complete statement. Stick her ass in a war zone and let's see how much she still wants war. 

The politicians are all for war as long as they are not the ones doing the fighting. That is what he said. If you are too obtuse to understand, perhaps it is time to step back from your hatred and take a deep breath.

What if Trump had instead said, ""Tucker Carlson has been such an ally of our campaign.  Let's give him a round of applause.""  What do you think the audience would do?  ""Let's"" is an exhortation for the audience to act.  Obviously, no one in the audience is going to run out of the auditorium looking for Cheney, but it's clearly a call to action.

Trump was talking about how Liz Cheney was such a war hawk always wanting him to go to war with this country or that. And if she wanted war so bad “get a rifle and have 9 barrels pointing back at you and see how you like it”. Now I’m not even sure how much the label of “war hawk” applies to Liz Cheney..

All I know is while his statement is ironic and a lot of bluster from a draft dodging coward this whole narrative has gotten out of hand, and it’s not necessary.

Trump says plenty of deranged and idiotic things to ding him for without making stuff up. It negates when he really says threats and lowers the bar of authenticity for him because the conversation is now so low brow. Let’s not fall for it.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Stop with the bullshit. Trump is a piece of shit but he didn't call for her to be executed. The whole statement says that she should go out to the front line in war to see how she feels when the other army is pointing their guns/ shooting at her because her and her family are warhawks. It was a stupid ass comment by Trump because he's an idiot and says dumbass shit all the time. But democrats should be better then this and the republican type bullshit scare tactics.

We have started changing rules to go after this orange turd. In turn, it gave his fans a legitimate claim to it being all lies against him. Doing this shit is the reason that his campaign has a chance of winning.

I learned a hard lesson in the Army. A guy fucked me over in a big way. So i came out of the gate looking for blood. I went through all the right channels, all the proper greivances filed in legitimate issues. I pushed hard to bury this asshole. The military looked at it as a massive headache that was easier to let him finish his separation than handel. My SGT came to me afterward and gave me a heart to heart about how if i had trusted him to back channel it with the lesser offenses i could have tacked on the heavy shit once those were underway and nailed him. Instead he got off scott free and i got a no contact order from my chain of command.

We swung for the fence with trump, tried to change the rules to win, and tried to dig up enough shit to bury him. When if we had just stuck with tearing him down using shit he did on camera and let the other cases play out without making an international circus out of it and personally attacking anyone who supports him its quite possible that he would have ran his supporters off himself.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

And he has a great foil in BBC journalist Katy Kay. Honestly can’t think of a more engaging, entertaining and insightful podcast right now.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Hot take: TRIP-US is a lot better than TRIP; they are both so much more directly connected to their subject matter that their takes are more informed, and they have genuine insider information. Mooch called the Kamala coronation literally immediately after the Biden debate for example. 

TRIP has become so current affairs focussed that they very often stray into areas they just don’t have nuanced takes on - Rory in particular gets on his high horse about anything vaguely Asia (pronounced “aishhha” cause it’s 1878 apparently) related.

"It's important, then, that we don't take pressure off the corporate organisations and news outlets that have enabled and even endorsed him and his fascist ideals. 

MCDONALD'S CORPORATE knew about Trumps photo op/campaign ad he used their branding for. There seems to be a lot of (likely guided) confusion around this saying only the franchise location knew. The facts show that MCDONALDS CORPORATE KNEW about it BEFORE he went there, and they welcomed the idea. I CONSIDER THIS AS MCDONALDS ENDORSING FASCISM IN AMERICA.

JEFF BEZOS BLOCKED an endorsement for Kamala in his paper THE WASHINGTON POST. He's owned this paper since 2013 and the paper has endorsed candidates for each presidential election since. Somehow, when there is a BLATANT FASCIST running for the side they don't usually endorse, BEZOS decides this time, somehow, it wasn't right not endorse the one who isn't running as a FASCIST. This came days after another one of BEZOS' companies BLUE ORIGIN met with the FASCIST TRUMP TEAM.

CNN is now owned by an apparent Trump supporter, but make no mistake, they are far from the only ones responsible for holding a double standard when it comes to covering this passed election. Each of the major mainstream news outlets have sanewashed the shit out of Trumps TERRORIST rhetoric. They called Biden old and feable before he dropped out, but seemed shy about doing the same when Trump became the only geriatric candidate still in the race. Not to mention, they've made obvious attempts to bury the worst of Trumps messaging and did their best to sell the lighter, more stupid shit Trump has done. They've done this to get clicks and money. They've been instrumental in TRUMPS TERRORISM because they know the tighter they can keep the race, the more they can make us worry about the future of our country, the more money they make. Instead of informing the public, they played with our sense of security for a point or 2 increase in profits.

There are plenty more examples, but these are some more recent and noteable ones off the top of my head.

My main point is **FUCK THESE GREEDY CORPORATE PIG FUCKERS. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU, OR ME, THE REST OF AMERICA, OR OUR CONSTITUTION. THEY LIKELY DETEST EVERY RIGHT WE ARE STILL ABLE TO CLING TO AS AMERICANS. THEY DON'T WANT CONSUMER RIGHTS. THEY DON'T WANT WORKERS RIGHTS. THEY DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THEY SURE AS SHIT HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE PUBLIC HAVING A SAY IN WHAT OFFICIALS AND  WHAT POLICIES WE ARE SUBJECTED TO. THESE CORPORATIONS AND BILLIONAIRES DO NOT WANT DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA. THESE CORPORATE SHITSTAINS ARE AT ODDS WITH YOU AND ANY RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS YOU DEPEND ON.** 

**IF WE DO NOT HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKE OUR DISDAIN FOR THEIR MUTATED GREED AND THEIR DISREGARD FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN LIVES KNOW WHILE WE HAVE THE CHANCE, THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER THAT *THEY WILL ENDORSE FASCISM AGAIN*, SHOULD AMERICA WEATHER THIS TIDE OF FASCISM WE CURRENTLY FACE.**",2024_11_02,05_26_36

I’m going to assume your main gripe is the sentencing date. What difference do you think that would have made? If Trump was sentenced pre-election what does it achieve?

Anyone who actually cares about the law is already convinced by the conviction that Trump is a criminal piece of shit unworthy of the presidency. The sentencing is immaterial to that group so I just don’t think a pre-election sentence motivates any additional people to vote against Trump. And the risk of motivating Trump supporters is super high, as is the risk for general violence perpetrated by Trump supporters. 

As for the sentence itself. Well if Trump loses and merchan knows as a matter of fact he won’t become president then it allows him to drop a harsher sentence without worrying about it being inconsequential or complicated due to it being a sitting president.

"> Last week, KCRC-TV — a station in Redding — reported that other Reddit users searched ManCow2000’s post and comment histories and were able to identify him as Charles Pierce of Redding. The outlet also reported that users forwarded Pierce’s claims to the FBI.

I'm commenting only so that I remember later on to check the news for Charles Pierce of Redding; I'd like to see how this story develops.

Also as a fun bit of trivia and for me to better retain the name Charles Pierce of Redding, as an avid *Mystery Science Theater 3000* fan I recognize that he shares a name with Charles B. Pierce, who wrote, directed, and starred in *Boggy Creek II: And the Legend Continues*, in which he costarred with his son, Chuck Pierce, whose legal name I presume to be Charles Pierce, Jr., which further helps me to remember Charles Pierce of Redding.  I hear that the director Pierce was actually a decent independent filmmaker and that the original *Legend of Boggy Creek* was a good if low-budget monster movie, and I'm just now learning from IMDB that he was a contributing writer for *Sudden Impact*, but I'm hardly a cinephile and only know *Boggy Creek II* of Charles B. Pierce's work.

But for whatever interest you may or may not have derived from this, again, I only wrote this to help me remember the name Charles Pierce of Redding and to occasionally search the news from time to time if I don't happen to hear more of Charles Pierce of Redding.

Last time, I promise: Charles Pierce of Redding.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Sure.

It's a signal to noise issue.

According to The Heritage Foundation, a hyper right leaning conservative think tank on the forefront of voter fraud panic, [there have been about 1,600 cases of voter fraud since 1979.](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search) Those cases actually contain a bunch of stuff that isn't voter fraud or wouldn't be caught by ID checks, such as voter intimidation, ballot harvesting, and altering vote counts, but we'll assume that they are all voter fraud that would be caught with ID checks because that casts the broadest net here.

[154,600,000 people voted in the last presidential election alone.](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/2020-presidential-election-voting-report.html) Meaning that if *every single instance of voter fraud ever* happened in *just that single election,* the rate would be roughly 0.001% or one in every million votes or so is fraudulent.

[Comparatively, the number of people who lack sufficient photo ID to vote is about 10%.] (https://cdce.umd.edu/sites/cdce.umd.edu/files/pubs/Voter%20ID%202023%20survey%20Key%20Results%20Jan%202024%20(1).pdf) Why is it about 10%? Doesn't really matter. That's about one in every 10 eligible votes that you're throwing in the trash, in order to catch the roughly one in every *million* fraudulent votes. That's 100,000 eligible voters disenfranchised for every single fraudulent vote you cast. 

And remember, that's assuming that every instance of voter fraud in the last nearly half-century happened in *one single election.* When you extrapolate the data out across the actual timeframe, you find that voters commit fraud at about the same rate as people get *struck by lightning.*

Divided by the number of states, you can expect any given election in any given state to have some single digit instances of voter fraud each year based on population. Anecdotally, I've seen more people in the NC subreddits complain about ID related issues preventing them from voting than we would expect to see cases of voter fraud.

Voter ID at its core isn't a terrible idea, but in every state where it's pushed, they also make it far more difficult to obtain said ID. They'll set up one DMV for 750k people and then operate it two days out of the week during work hours. At the same time, they'll charge $30-$60 to get said ID.

There's lots of reasons for vote by mail, unless you want to make it more difficult for people to vote because you assume it'll help your side.

If some has examples of your signature/initial (like a shady landlord) it's pretty easy to get a ""good enough"" mark with a little practice.

I should add that this is exceedingly rare, and usually caught because most people who expect a ballot mailed will get a replacement and return it or try to vote in person, where they will find out that a ballot has already been returned in their name and then you begin the investigative process.  Under stricter scrutiny (which you simply cannot maintain normally and still get the work done in time without dozens of staff trained in graphology) these forgeries are usually pretty evident and that finding is presented to whatever elections board oversees your jurisdiction.

This has been happening for a hundred years at this point. Normally volunteer work, or low pay.

"> Isn’t that just like you’re not registered for one of the main parties? 

Pretty much.  Obviously we have two major parties but there are dozens of recognized political parties (Green, Libertarian, etc).  In some states, your party designation determines if you can vote in the primary elections but that varies by state.  If you don’t select a party, you’re defaulted to independent.  

Choosing a party also matters when it comes to public funding of campaigns, ballot access etc.   it’s confusing AF and we need to ditch voter party affiliation (and push for run off elections to give other parties fair access)",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"It depends on the state. Here in Oregon if you don't choose a party when you are registering to vote you are put in the independent party. It's not a real party but a designation. 

In some states you have to be in a major party to vote in primaries and in others everyone can vote in them. Some people game the system and change registration so they can vote for a bad candidate on the other side and then change back at a later date. 

Independent doesn't have a candidate who runs here in Oregon.  But remember, each state is different, they all have their own rules.  I'm a registered Democrat who is also a PCP. Which is a precinct committee person. I was on the ballot during the primaries.  This allows me to vote in the county Democratic party.  

If there is a vacancy in the state, for reasons such as death or they are tapped to be part of the presidential administration. I get to vote on a group of people who could replace them and they are sent to the governor. Independents aren't allowed to vote in that way.

Every state has pcps and national delegates that are elected. When they have the conventions, those people are voted on by their party and sent to vote for the state. And again, here in Oregon, independents are not allowed to vote in the nomination of either major party. 

This was a long answer and I have more to say, ask away if you have any questions.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I am an American but I’m not fully sure 😂because states handle registration and elections differently. Something like 30 states allow you to choose party affiliation when you register to vote. I assume that a registered independent is someone who is unaffiliated with any party.

I’m effectively the same but I’ve only lived and voted in states that don’t have party registration on your voter registration. These states tend to have “open primaries” where anyone can vote in the democratic or republican primaries— but they can only vote in one.

You live with that person, share a house/apartment with, has sexual intercourse with all the time, have kids together...  But something stops you from sharing your polical views? Makes absolutely no sense to me.



Is it because the state these women live on is SO red, that marrying someone with shared values is simply not an option? Is there cultural influence to marry people you're not fully in love with, just not to be alone?",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I can't even see living in the same house as a person with different political views than mine. I had an INCEL/Republican literally stalk me for a long time because he felt he could change me into the type of woman he wanted and a potential wife. He started by evangelizing me and leaving gifts all the time. He got mutual friends to encourage me to date him. When I wouldn't he started calling me constantly until I changed the number but that didn't help because he had access to them via work.  He drunk dialed me several times, called me nasty names like ""frigid"" because I wouldn't date him or sleep with him at all. 

He was absolutely the type to dictate what his wife would do including vote.

Women and men equally deserve to choose the mix of career and childcare that is right for them and their families.  Republicans need to stop controlling everyone.


Edit:  I hate how people dismiss what is involved in rasing children or making a home.  This is critical for society to function and ""the party of family values"" completely devalues it in part because they see it has women's work that doesn't generate revenue.  See also: caring for the sick, disabled, and elderly",2024_11_02,05_26_36

I was stuck in a state where my name was enough to get me discriminated against often enough that other people were shocked when it happened in front of them and I didn’t see it as anything new. 

I should have just left the state. 

Except leaving means having the means to rely on savings to pay for an initial payment on a new place to live. Be it rent or own. By yourself. 

It means being able to afford the expense of moving whatever stuff you have left. Having the stability for work to survive being in a place without the same safety net you just had. 

This was just moving states. 

Now imagine leaving someone and having to pay for a lawyer. Imagine knowing how this person will react and knowing your life is going to be in an even worse level of hell. Imagine knowing your workplace will become bad as that spouse is going to contact people there. Imagine how children make this all way more complicated.

Leaving isn’t easy. It isn’t even possible for some without a possibility of death. Is it worth dying?

The specifics of ALL these claims/concerns are trivially debunked, but their amygdala no longer allows that information to be processed.

"I was willing to try literally anything, and had had enough of hearing that I “needed more Jesus”. That simply wasn’t helping at all and I’d read news articles about psychedelics being studied to treat alcohol addiction in Europe.

It gave my mind the “reset” I needed to not crave alcohol anymore, I was able to find the self confidence that I’d been looking for previously by getting drunk. I’ve never felt like I wanted to or needed to drink at all since then. I can “just say no”.

Previously, I couldn’t go more than day without drinking, and it would have to be strong liquor. Overnight, I was able to stop and have been since 7/15/20.

So basically you are just saying I need to be handed over to a man. It’s not what you meant to say I’m sure but you’re just describing the system that said I must belong to a man or in an asylum with a lobotomized brain in order to avoid the repercussions of too many single men.

Imo the way out is less inequality and greater women’s rights. Financial/social inequality and the patriarchy lead women to join what are essentially harems today just as the same mechanisms pushed women into harems yesterday.

# Analysis of Public Statement Under True Threat Doctrine

*Date: November 1, 2024*

## Summary

This memorandum analyzes a recent public statement by Donald Trump regarding Liz Cheney under the ""true threat"" doctrine, considering both immediate legal standards and broader contextual factors.

## Statement at Issue

>""Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face"" ([Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-cheney-face-guns-arizona-rally-rcna120679))

## Legal Framework

### Federal Law

Under 18 U.S.C. § 875(c), it is a federal crime to transmit ""any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another"" in interstate commerce ([Source](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/875)). The Supreme Court in *Watts v. United States*, 394 U.S. 705 (1969), established that only ""true threats"" fall outside First Amendment protection ([Source](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/394/705/)).

### True Threat Doctrine

In *Virginia v. Black*, 538 U.S. 343 (2003), the Supreme Court defined ""true threats"" as ""statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals"" ([Source](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/538/343/)).

### State Law Considerations

Under Arizona Revised Statutes § 13-1202(A), threatening or intimidating is defined as follows ([Source](https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/01202.htm)):

A person commits threatening or intimidating if the person threatens or intimidates by word or conduct:

1. To cause physical injury to another person or damage to property of another; or
2. To cause, or in reckless disregard to causing, serious public inconvenience including evacuation of a building, place of assembly, or transportation facility; or
3. To cause physical injury to another person or damage to property of another in order to promote, further or assist in the interests of or to cause, induce or solicit another person to participate in a criminal street gang, a criminal syndicate or a racketeering enterprise.

## Prima Facie Analysis

### Elements Under 18 U.S.C. § 875(c)

1. Interstate communication
2. Contains a threat
3. Defendant transmitted knowingly and intentionally

### Factors Supporting Protected Speech Classification

* Conditional and hypothetical nature (""Let's see how she feels"")
* Public forum context about a public figure (heightened First Amendment protection under *New York Times v. Sullivan*, 376 U.S. 254 (1964)) ([Source](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/376/254/))
* Rhetorical rather than specific threatening language
* Absence of immediate expressed intent

### Criminal Threatening Elements (ARS § 13-1202)

To establish criminal threatening, prosecutors must prove:

1. Statement constitutes a genuine threat rather than protected speech
2. A reasonable person would interpret it as a serious expression of intent
3. Threat is not merely conditional or ambiguous
4. Intent to threaten or intimidate through word or conduct

## Contextual Considerations

### Pattern of Incitement Analysis Under Brandenburg

Under *Brandenburg v. Ohio*, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), speech advocating illegal conduct is protected unless it is ""directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action"" ([Source](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/)).

### Historical Impact Evidence

* Law enforcement documentation of increased threats (FBI Bulletin 2021-0345)
* Academic studies correlating political rhetoric with violence (American Political Science Review, Vol. 115, No. 4)
* Threat assessment protocols (U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center guidelines)

### Relevant Case Law on Context

* *Planned Parenthood v. American Coalition of Life Activists*, 290 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir. 2002) (context of violence against specific targets relevant to true threat analysis) ([Source](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1332957.html))
* *United States v. Turner*, 720 F.3d 411 (2d Cir. 2013) (history of violent responses to similar statements relevant) ([Source](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1638466.html))

## Analysis

### Application of True Threat Doctrine

While the statement in isolation might not meet the *Watts* test for a ""true threat,"" several factors warrant consideration under *Virginia v. Black*:

1. Speaker's documented history of followers acting on inflammatory statements
2. Established pattern of similar rhetoric leading to violence
3. Speaker's demonstrated awareness of influence over followers' actions

### Brandenburg Test Application

The statement potentially fails the imminence requirement of *Brandenburg*, but the ""likely to produce such action"" element merits closer examination given:

1. Documented patterns of follower response
2. Specific targeting of named individual
3. Clear description of violent acts

## Conclusion

Though the statement alone likely falls short of criminal threatening under ARS § 13-1202 or 18 U.S.C. § 875(c), the speaker's established pattern of inflammatory rhetoric resulting in actual violence provides critical context that could influence its reasonable interpretation under *Virginia v. Black*. The totality of circumstances suggests a more nuanced legal analysis is warranted than traditional true threat doctrine alone would indicate.

## Recommendation

1. Document and monitor specific impacts for potential future legal consideration
2. Consider referral to threat assessment units for evaluation under USSS protocols
3. Review for potential civil liability under relevant statutes
4. Maintain records for possible pattern evidence in future proceedings

Yes, what Trump said was bad. Yes, maybe it should be punishable under the law. And yes, stochastic terrorism should probably be punishable in some way. It isn't currently, and announcing a plan to change legislation or create a plan to prosecute people for it would be infinitely more purposeful than sending a defective to ask Trump if he really wants to kill a rival politician or whatever people think a ""death threat investigation"" actually is.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I loathe Trump. In this case though I see what he was trying to say, that she should see what it’s like to be on the front lines in combat as he was suggesting she wants war. But, in typical Trump style he a) didn’t even vaguely screen what he was saying for potential problems and b) he got excited at the image he was creating and that took it in a much more sinister direction that would likely be what his nuttier followers could view as an execution request. This guy needs to go, I dread to think of him on the international stage in his current condition. He was shit and dangerous enough when he was president last time and he’s a lot worse now.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Sad truth….but I seriously don’t expect anything to come of it. 

He was speaking about her being an avowed hawk on war and stating this as  “see how hawkish she is with 9 barrels in her face”. It’s he same well crafted bullshit he’s done his whole adult life. (Remember “Stand down, and stand by”?). 

Reality is this….Trump has spent a life mastering plausible deniability. He’s a horrible businessman, but that doesn’t matter as he’s always been solid at being litigious and learning how to communicate in a litigious world. 

It should never be forgotten that he cut his teeth in this under Roy Cohn, who cut his teeth under Joseph McCarthy, one of political skill that used his skill big time for ill l, rather than for good to a grossly damaging degree). 

This weird way of speaking to both make threats and have some level of plausible deniability is incredibly effective under ideologically co-opted (and in many cases just not very bright) supportive voters/zombies. 

And that’s what this was…..a whistle to the zombies. A nice visual of this woman with guns in her face. Just the kind of Americans that would…..mock Kamala being led in chains in a parade. They are seeing really bad news in turnout numbers so far.   They need to try to charge their base. 

I say all this to say…he whistled to the zombies here. A vision of a threat. Everyone absolutely call it out. Point at it like the DiCaprio pointing at the TV screen gif. When you see this bullshit absolutely scream it from the rooftop. 

But the system still isn’t set up to handle this……double speak with deniability. I don’t see much coming from this. I’m glad they are looking closer. Because if we get through this election well enough we need our leaders to work to set up guide rails against such dangerous speak from someone with so much profile trying to get so much power.  

We get through this and we need to apply what we learned from Trump. We used to all agree at an ethical level that this was wrong speak and behavior. But Donald Pandora has opened that box. We need to put steel behind this expectation.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

After snooping around on posts here now, commenting on a few and seeing reactions, I’m appalled at the echo chamber. What Trump said today was ridiculous, but what’s happened since; the media coverage about a quote taken out of context (hell, even CNN had to state a retraction), Kamala saying this quote makes him unfit, etc…has been mind blowing and has me questioning literally everything I’ve ever considered to be sure messaging from the party I grew up voting for. Now this. This is insane, and you all need to take a step back. I won’t vote for Trump, but I’m no longer voting for Kamala and the democrats.

"So, listening to what he said it's pretty clear he meant something like Cheney is a hawk who is more than happy to sacrifice others when she wouldn't do the same (there's a certain irony in this statement given Musk and Trump's comments about Americans needing to be prepared to suffer economically but that's a digression). 

I think the concern is more about the explicit evocation of violence against her, even if he was just trying to say she's a hypocrite. It's about escalating violent rhetoric, especially given Trump's other comments about her and others, and the history of violence justified by perpetrators by referring to Trump's comments.

He could have called Cheney a hypocrite without being so provocative, and so \*explicitly\* propositional of violence: ""Cheney sends others into battle when she wouldn't go into battle herself"", for example. But no, he says ""let's do X, Y, and Z."" Is it rhetorical? Sure. Suggestive though? Yes. Are Trump's comments being spun in a misleading way? Probably but Trump also has a history of trying to avoid responsibility by indirectly suggesting things via ""code"".

The names will doubtlessly say the same, but the issues and values will hopefully reflect some new party beliefs. 

A lot of states look like they're moving to ranked choice voting in the near future. An expansion of 3rd parties is a realistic thing for a lot of people in the next 5-10 years. 

My state usually votes 10+% libertarian, and we have a ballot initiative that will require a winner to get 50% +1 vote to win...so a 3rd party vote with a ranked choice second vote can most definitely start swinging elections for me.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

""But he didn't mean that!"" IS all we ever hear out of MAGA. If Harris or Biden had said the exact same thing about Trump, MAGA would be armed to the teeth right now.

Taking one comment in isolation is one thing. Taking all of his consistently violent rhetoric and the reactions  of such from his people together... is quite another.

They hunted for Nancy Pelosi in the capitol while people hid behind barricaded doors. 

""But that's not what he meant!"". HIs supporters seemed to believe that's what he meant, and now we have him making more statements pointing toward the danger/death of another one of his opponents.

"Forget the headlines saying Harris “will” win. 

That’s how people stay home, thinking they’re safe. 

That’s how Trump gets elected. Again. 

Are you going to vote and actually do something to help Harris, or are you going to falsely assume that enough other people will do it for you?  ",2024_11_02,05_26_36

All gas, no brakes.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"For the sake of actually discussing the article (which already recommends that readers vote), I think they make good points and I think they’re right. 

Polling is a great indicator to get a feel for the temperature but they don’t always accurately predict election winners and turnouts and they kind of neglect large parts of the electorate. It very well maybe a situation where polls show a dead heat yet Harris wins in a landslide. 

America has changed so much since 2016. We’re not even the same country that we were in 2020. 

Demographics have changed drastically, older generations have slowly been phasing out while newer generations and younger voters are phased in. Socially, we collectively think different from 2016 and 2020. Tons of people have changed, their ideals have softened and their beliefs have progressed. 

I wholeheartedly believe that we’re living through a political realignment and it’s going to result in us electing our first woman president.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

In addition, remember that DOWN BALLOT is just as crucial. That means local and state elections, not to mention lots and lots of propositions, state amendments, and many other things are up for grabs. 

If you haven't voted already, then VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. Don't assume it's in the bag and stay home. Don't forget everything and everyone else on the ballot.

"I’ve been thinking and coming to terms with something rather dark. Not to dampen the mood but I think it is important. I’ve come to the acceptance that if Trump wins, our country already is broken beyond repair.

How every single (almost) former staffer, cabinet member, lawyer, and other important officials, hundreds of former Republican president admin officials, Hundreds of other Republican politicians, dozens of papers, journals, hundreds of celebrities, can all endorse Harris and Trump would still win.

How Trump becomes more and more plainly delusional and insane. Aggressive and vindictive. Cruel and out of control and he could win against Kamala Harris.

How his own chief of staff and chief of national security could state openly and plainly on the record that he is a fascist and admires dictators and strongmen, and the American people would elect him. 

How we have seen for near a decade the vile, disgusting, disturbing man he is and people could still get believe he is best for our country. 

It makes no sense. If Trump wins, it will not be the fault of Kamala Harris and her campaign. It will be us who let her and let America down. We will deserve the future we get. 

Ok I have purged the negativity from my system.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Embarrassing unskewing the polls nonsense.

Reasonable people can disagree about whether justice is inevitable in the long term. Justice certainly isn't inevitable in the short term.

Also by their neighborhoods and communities getting flooded with tainted-drugs and fentanyl.

What Republicans don't understand is that a lot or majority of women don't want to do abortion, but the option or having a choice for it is Important because a lot of us can't predict the future. It's a safety net just in case horrible things do happen.  Sure of course there are a few women who probably have aborted for the wrong reasons but why take away the choice for majority of us. If they really want us to be comfortable and try to become mothers, they have to accept that we want the medical options to be available for us just in case we suffer miscarriages or life threatening problems due to the pregnancy. We have to look out for women because miscarriages are actually super common. You want these women to miscarry safely so they can try again.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

A tween/teen in 2016 is now able to vote. Lots has indeed changed.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"> Polling is a great indicator to get a feel for the temperature but they don’t always accurately predict election winners and turnouts and they kind of neglect large parts of the electorate.

Polls tend to neglect low engagement voters because they are much harder (read: more expensive) to poll. This demographic tends to lean towards Trump. If anything the polls are much more likely to underestimate Trump in a higher turnout elections such as the presidential ones, as happened in 2016 and 2020.

The only way the polls are realistically underestimating Harris is if there is a significant bloc of ""silent"" women voters who votes based on abortion policy, but there is very little to suggest that that is the case.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"She's intentionally avoided identity politics in her campaign. She would be a lot of firsts, but Hillary's campaign largely relied upon identity politics rather than the fundamentals of her candidacy. It felt very ""vote for me because I'll be the first woman president"" and Harris is going for ""vote for me because I'll be a good president"". A lot of the Republican defectors and independents that she's trying to court would reject her if she focused on being the first this or that, but she still accomplishes all those firsts if she just focuses on her individual merits and likability instead, which is what she's doing.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I \*sincerely\* think both campaigns are avoiding issues that might get people to avoid voting because of them. For both, they're treating the immunity decision like a third rail.

But even women were saying, “I’m not asking why I should vote for a woman. I’m asking why I should vote for you.” 

Brilliant move by Kamala staying away from identity politics. She doesn’t even engage when asked questions about it. I don’t think I’ve seen one time where she mentioned she’d be the first woman president and her campaign obviously dissuades others from focusing on that point. Results are great. The whole “should a woman be president” hasn’t even been a talking point - but maybe that’s also a reflection of progress in our society over the last several years on the view of women.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

If anything Dem voters are more likely to report a higher motivation to vote (because of voter demographics), leading to Trump voters being more likely to be screened out of polls, meaning that a high turnout will favour Trump because less engaged voters will turn up to vote.

Mid-terms are lower turnout elections meaning that the party with the more engaged and highly conscientious voters (the Dems) are more likely to overperform their polling.

Identity politics are the absolute lowest floor of politics. I'm a white dude, and lots of white dudes share literally 0 goals with me and the fact that a president is a dude and white means ZERO. I imagine plenty of black and women voters are tired of black and women politicians who represent right wing conservative positions that are directly oppositional to their interests too.

Ok that actually makes sense. But most people who don't need to answer the phone for work wouldn't do that. And then there's also online polls--i don't know who would click on unsolicited links from unknown senders either. It just seems very difficult to get an accurate reading these days. I'm sure social media platforms can do it with their creepily accurate algorithms--maybe that will be a new revenue stream for them in the future.

From the article:

> ""It’s hard to overstate how traumatic the 2016 and 2020 elections were for many pollsters. For some, another underestimate of Mr. Trump could be a major threat to their business and their livelihood. For the rest, their status and reputations are on the line. If they underestimate Mr. Trump a third straight time, how can their polls be trusted again? It is much safer, whether in terms of literal self-interest or purely psychologically, to find a close race than to gamble on a clear Harris victory.

> At the same time, the 2016 and 2020 polling misfires shattered many pollsters’ confidence in their own methods and data. When their results come in very blue, they don’t believe it. And frankly, I share that same feeling: If our final Pennsylvania poll comes in at Harris +7, why would I believe it? As a result, pollsters are more willing to take steps to produce more Republican-leaning results.""

Not much suggests that. We would see a stronger gender disparity in the numbers if that was the case.

Yes, but there is a likely issue that a lot of uneducated/unknowledgable voters actually do not identify Trump as the reason for Roe v. Wade being repealed. For once it happened during a Dem presidency, and many people will simply associate guilt with the Supreme Court.

The second is that abortion is not a ""new"" issue to this election, which makes it harder for Dems to drum up voter enthusiasm about the issue.

That said there is a fair chance that women voters might decide the election, but in any case it will be very close.

* he bankrupted like every business he was involved in and refused to pay people and only got away with it because he screwed them out of the money they needed to sue him, and the economy, his strategy is to get rid of protections that protect the people and the country and our way of life, our means to earn a living and live off the land and sea when that fails, He will continue screwing people because he can profit from it and get away with it, because people believe wrongfully, incorrectly believe that a short term gain, outweighs the long term consequence that the people the country and the planet will pay for. this list could be way longer. considering the election is very soon, it should be. a big one is, Harris may propose an assault weapon ban, but trump proposed to terminate the constitution, and all the rights laws and freedoms enshrined therein. reaffirming that trump is the one who in his own words intends to ""take the guns first, due process later"" not kamala harris. people still believe in Qanon, despite trump admitting that Qanon is crap, also his own words. and if it is crap, then why else? on a related note, they believe that he is uh, pro abortion, but if you believe his accuser, when she was tied up to a bed at 13, he ignored her request to use a condom, and threw cash in her face telling her to get an abortion. they believe that he is going to, uproot establishment, or deep state, he wants to install his own. he wants to replace the media with his own state media because fox wasn't loyal enough, despite editing his reaction to the Epstein question, and not telling him that he was live on air when he said ""we gotta kill families."" people believe that he is pro gun, that he is pro free speech, he already has infringed on both and doesn't hide that he intends to continue doing so if re-elected. its a lot easier to haggle and argue about whether he violated the constitutional rights, by passing red flag laws, then it is to argue that he didn't violate 1st amendment free speech with censorship on truth social, but what can't be disputed or argued is that on that same platform, he claimed to create for free speech, he used it to post a call to terminate the constitution, making him, truly unfit, and untrustworthy, to uphold the oath to defend the document that he is calling to terminate, that all military and government and police are all sworn to defend by force. so, no, he is not the bigger defender or the lesser evil when it comes to any rights or freedoms enshrined in the constitution. no, he will not defend the freedoms they think he will, poisoning the land, people, cutting off those in dire need and leaving alliances won't make us great. about that, they think he is against the communists, the communists put money in his chinese account when he left office his products are made in china and he intends to cut off aid to Ukraine while people waving soviet flags invade ukraine, he is not against the communists, he is in love with kim jung un, and thats not just softening relations, he is helping our adversary at our expense, literal expense, we pay more to properly dispose of unused expired rocket then we do to give them to people who need them to defend their homes and people and country. he promised to end the war? by cutting off urgently needed aid, which doesn't really end the war, or prevent it from spreading or leading to another one. it emboldens them and strengthens them instead of stopping them and setting a precedent.he added more to the national debt than bidenthey believe that he will be the end of false flags. he openly proposed false flags when he was president.he is not of God, he admitted he is not christian when he said you won't have to vote anymore if I win.he does not embody any of the values or teachings or obey any of the commandmentshe admitted to sexually assaulting a married woman. He lies constantly. He stole both health, home freedom and life with his actions, that killed americans, here in the homeland.and no, he is not the pro Israel ticket either, he said to blame the Jews if he loses the election.oh, forgot another one, drain the swamp? he put scott pruitt, a man who sued the EPA on behalf of big oil, for protecting the environment, and by extension, not just wildlife but us too, that guy to be in charge of the EPA. He put a woman who wants to defund public schools in charge of department of education.\^he did not drain the swamp, he installed and appointed swamp monsters and made it worse than ever before
* despite Qanon claiming he is secretly fighting pedophiles, he admitted that assertion is crap, he owned a teen beauty pageant and used owner status to look at the girls in the dressing room, his daughter ivanka said yeah he does that like she is used to it, and to top it off, he didn't just fly on the epstein plane and didn't just molest, but forcibly raped young girls, when they cried for him don't do it, and then to stop doing it despite her clear boundary and plea that he either don't penetrate her, stop penetrating her or use a condom, and he told her to ""get an abortion bitch"" so he isn't even really pro life, and if he went from saying the days of infringing on your 2nd amendment is over to saying take the guns first due process later, what makes you think he won't show his true colors on abortion after he wins a 2nd term?",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Motherfucker has had these tapes since 2017 and he waited until 5 days before the election to say anything?

"I already voted for Kamala it's over for me. I knew the right move. There are lots of people  who aren't paying any attention, and this won't do it. 

We NEED THAT RECORDING. We need pictures. We need the sources and weel need it all in a format that can be texted so that we can pull as many people off the ledge as possible  before the end. A little article with paraphrased and selected quotes isn't going to do it, because the onpy people  left are skeptical of media. 

We need a raw clip. If it's in YouTube it can't be from CNN's channel. If it's pictures, they can't be shown on WaPo's homepage. We need something that isn't producing monetary value for a media company, and it still won't get everyone.  

I didn't see that in this link.  Does anyone have anything  close to that?",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Although I doubt it would matter to MAGAs.  They're already all in.  And they can't deal with admitting they were duped. 

It really shows the state of the United States. I'd say we're cooked or have been cooked for a while by the wealthy, powerful, our enemies, etc",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I've watched the whole campaign this year and what happened on January 6th, 2021. 
I can tell you that America is heading towards a very dangerous direction.

Do not let history repeat itself. 
We've all learned history in schools, and today, we have very good resources to learn more about it in various forms, whether through books and articles or professors complimentarily giving you information on podcasts and well made documentaries.

America is going more mad, more extreme, and it is going more barbaric. 
Most of the renowned Trump supporters are

 A: super rich  like Elon Musk, who can easily fascinate and suck up to Trump, and the government can't really affect their well-being, 

B: Pro-Israelis, who fail to recognize war crimes, decades of military occupation, decades of inhume blockade in Gaza, expansion of the West Bank Settlememts, and the brutality of their so called defense forses commited by Israeli government and its far right  leader Benjamin Netanyahu, 

C: a far-right extremist and a radical conservative with similar ideologies to those of Trump, politicians who are bored with democrats, find Trump funny and powerful but tend to neglect all the downsides of Trump, the risk of his policies, or how he performed during his presidency.

D: ordinary people who are under educated, who lack some information and knowledge, who lack some decent values that make us human and make us united, and who are misled by false media. 

I'm not saying there's zero flaw in democratic party. 
First of all, a lack of campaign strategies and Harris not being able to answer questions in articulate fashion in some interviews even though her careers and experiences in the field are qualified enough to be a president of the United States. 
Democrats are also getting more and more angry and sometimes stoop to low levels. 

Yes, we're close to the World War 3. 
But, Donald Trump had no idea how to even get through Covid Crisis. 
Imagine how he'd act if the war really spreads across the world.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Honestly they could release the photos of Trump with those kids and Maga would claim it’s ai. Besides they won’t release it because they would have to release all the names too.

The head of the family, Robert Maxwell is known today as a fraudster but he held many prominent newspapers and mainstream media. Including the European MTV, MacMillan publishing, the Mirror, and in America the New York Daily, Sinclair media. In addition to the Pergamon Press which was a Russia friendly press and news. The family was involved with early computer programs and popular computer and video games, most notably Tetris. And in government with the computer program Promis. Like Trump, Putin, and Bibi, the Maxwell family did not have a sense of humor if anyone spoke out about them or even comedy skits about the family and was never too busy to try and shut them up via lawsuits and the Court.

They were one of the few people allowed to invest in Soviet Russia. An interesting time period and relationships to read about on Wikipedia. Crazy how those events especially late 80’s-late 90’s have shaped so much of what we’re dealing with today geopolitically. 

Know this sounds all tin foil hat nonsense but the ties and relationships are legit available for surface level Wikipedia with sources to match. Like most topics with Trump it seems so wild he’s been without consequence in the media and with his base. I wish I was good with words and story telling but I’m not. However I do hope someone or a group of folks that have a way with words and story telling in an appealing way with social media would pull some of these stories together and make it go viral.

""If you're okay with Trump being a rapist then there's nothing I can tell you that would make you second guess supporting him.""

He ended it by making a fantastic point.  His followers are trained to immediately disregard any story about him that's bad.  In the situation where it's highly credible that he did something wrong, they're further trained in whataboutism in comparing to Obama or Biden or Hillary, etc.

I'd like to think these people would draw the line at raping children but they will either not believe it to be true or follow-up by suggesting that Biden is a pedophile.

"When Epstein was caught and convicted 2007 on sex trafficking charges, then-US Attorney Alex Acosta gave him a ridiculous plea deal of soliciting prostitution (as if his underage victim was a prostitute, not a victim of abuse). This was after a 13-month federal investigation.

Acosta then granted Epstein and **any potential co-conspirators** immunity from federal prosecution, which shut down the rest of the FBI's investigation.

Acosta was shunned and fired, right?? Nope. He was appointed Secretary of Labor in Trump's cabinet in 2017, and served for 2 years, only resigning when Epstein was rearrested.

The Miami Herald did a great investigation into Acosta's deal for Epstein, finding that it violated several laws, including one that protected victim's rights.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

He gave an interview to New York Magazine in which he says this and is basically laughing up his sleeve about it, clearly enjoying that he's In The Know and gets to do this kind of stuff in plain sight.  It's unbelievably vile.  The idea that people like this can buy their way out of any legal consequences just makes you weep for the whole civilization.

But of course Trump supporters will try to spin it as though Trump did the right thing, when the truth is that he was well aware of Epstein's crimes - Epstein literally recruited victims at Trump's home - and was perfectly fine with it all until the two had a falling out that was unrelated to the pedophilia of it all. 

My guess, and this is just speculation, is that after Trump put the police on Epstein, Epstein made it clear to Trump that he had sufficient blackmail to destroy Trump, and Trump backed off. I think that explains why Trump's reaction to the arrest of Ghilslaine Maxwell was to ask, ""did she say anything about me?"", and his only public comments about it at the time was to wish her well.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"**""All MSM is conservative.""**

\^\^ THIS \^\^ 

Quite so.

All 'for profit' media has the same concerns that any private enterprise would have: they want to keep profits up. That means to keep costs down, like labor and benefits, and to avoid paying taxes. 

This is exactly what the Republican Party specializes in: advocacy for the rich and big corporations.

So in fact the ownership of for profit media always has an inherent bias toward Republican policies. 

Practicing journalism is their business model but the political bias of the ownership will generally be leaning toward conservative Republican or Libertarian policy. 

Freedom of the press includes the freedom to lie, and also the freedom to omit news without enduring coercion from the government. If the owners don't want a subject to be covered, it will not be covered.

For this reason I suggest everyone support Public Radio and Public Television while also checking in with the BBC for generally unbiased reporting of North American events.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

If Biden did in fact say, phonetically, ""his supporters his demonization of latinos is unconscionable"" then how would you punctuate that sentence in transcription?  I suppose you could try to create a sentence break.  Let's hear the audio?  First report I found is obviously edited to make it sound worse... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lob7qk1hrRc (sorry to link to that trash site but not sure where else to get a video)... they simply mute the audio after the word ""supporters.""  

I'm now on a whole other thing... why the heck is it seemingly impossible to find the original video?  I'm going through dozens of links here trying to find it and basically everything is meta commentary.  I don't even know anymore with all these ""SEO algorithms"" how to find an ORIGINAL video and not secondary sources.  And of course to even see whether a video is edited or original I have to wait through 30+ seconds of ads.  I hate this universe.  Finally here is one, and yeah there is a little more of a pause than one might like between ""supporters"" and ""his demonization.""  

All the same, I think we are long past the point where calling Trump supporters ""garbage"" is something anyone has any business being offended by.  If you can call me an ""NPC"" because I have the audacity to... want a functional government?... then yes, I feel fine calling you garbage because you think racist jokes are okay.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Can't lose something you never had in the first place. Why else do you think that *they* feel **free,** **confident and arrogant** ***due to*** despising actual education?

It's because without an education, you're ""free"" to believe horrific things and ***never have to ""feel bad"" about it*** (provided you ONLY stick to talking to all the others who are in the exact same boat and on the exact same side you're on).

Said ""freedom"" to be willfully stupid, though, comes at a cost that they can't ever shut the fuck up about:

""Waaaah the awful things I say and believe are making me lose friends and even my girlfriend left me and all I did was spit truth constantly. It's their fault, THEY could have chosen to agree, but THEY chose not to"". Funny choice of words for someone who lost a bunch of friends, but who am I to chime in?

They really do have this strict belief that ""opinions = the first amendment = untouchable by law AND **societal pushback**"" and that expressing these opinions should then automatically make them shielded from a) the law (even if they actively use illicit expressions in a painfully obvious way) and b) ***people having a real problem with being associated with pieces of shit.***

It's unreal the amount of narcissism that just overflows from them. It's no wonder they love Trump so much, they all want to actively be him. I hear some of his idiot supporters say shit like ""well if Trump broke the law to make a ton of money and then he got away with it, doesn't that make him the smart one?"" (as if theft and wonton criminal activity is something to strive for or even to look up to).

Morality, for as much as they claim CONSTANTLY that morality is the ONLY thing that drives them, is catastrophically vacant in just about every single one of them.

Then they bitch and moan once their feelings get hurt and they go so far with it that they have to be seen (**globally**) dumping out all the beer they bought with their money because they got butt hurt over a mere fucking LABEL.

And THEY want to call everyone ELSE the snowflakes? BRO, a **beer can label sent them rocket shipping to the god damn moon and back from white hot rage.** They were SO pissed that they saw the label online and *then* bought fucking 30-racks and *then* dumped it down the drain.

"I really don't get why the Trumpers are so freaked out by Harris. Like sure, she's a Democrat, but they are acting like the world will actually end if she wins. 

Granted, everyone else is terrified of Trump wins, but that's because he's fucking crazy and has openly stated he wants to end democracy. Like it's a very real scenario that democracy just dies.

If Harris wins she's just another in a long line of petty standard Democratic politicians. Nothing really changes. But because they've worked themselves into a frenzy by making up pure fiction about her they think she's as bad in their eyes as Trump is to the rest of us. I guess when the piece of shit you support really IS that bad, you've got to make the opposite side sound at least as scary. But like if you listen to Harris, nothing she says is scary. Again, standard political stuff. 

The stuff Trump says is actually insane. ""Mass deportations"", jailing people for their opinions, like this is stuff straight from Trump himself. It's not made up shit by Rachel Maddow, it's not some obscure left wing pundits just telling people this. Trump himself is saying it in front of crowds of people while being recorded. 

Project 2025 isn't some anonymous ""Q Anon"" making up rumors online. It's an official document, published where everyone can read it, from a huge well known Republican Think Tank, as actual policy they want to implement, with the authors being former Trump admin people who could actually return to power if Trump wins. 

So yeah, you could say plenty of Democrats are freaking the hell out too. But 1. The fears are well founded with practically daily reminders from the horse's mouth that he actually intends to make good on his threats. 2. None of us are behaving like Trumpers. They are assaulting people, vandalizing, stealing property (election signs), badgering people at early voting, lighting ballot boxes on fire, throwing out registered voters, threatening violence to Harris voters before, during, and after the election. Like it's not even close to the amount of absolute insane shit Trumpers are pulling. 

At the end of the day, I hope we all just quietly vote in large enough numbers to make it uncontestable. That is very clear who won to the point that it makes Trump's lawsuits and election shenanigans completely unfeasible.

> Recall that back in February, Trump threw out Ronna McDaniel as the head of the RNC and replaced her with his daughter-in-law Lara Trump. The national canvassing effort was turned over to Turning Point USA, an outfit for conservative college students run by Charlie Kirk with no canvassing experience. That effort seems to have largely collapsed outside of Arizona, and Elon Musk has stepped into the void with his America PAC.

> The Washington Post reported on America PAC last week. Musk, who is famously disdainful of advertising (Tesla doesn’t do it at all), has focused mostly on mailers and canvassing. But he’s also infamous for megalomaniac ambitions, slapdash technical execution, and impulsively firing contractors and staffers en masse. This has indeed happened at America PAC, as during the summer, Musk abruptly tossed three vendors who had been brought on to do canvassing work. Like Kirk, Musk also has no prior experience in the logistics of a national canvassing operation.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Most people have the vaccine, get tested, and take Paxlovid. But about 30 percent of republicans haven’t and still refuse to, which is about the same percentage of MAGAs. 

I have a friend who works at a hospital. She said they still see around a dozen unvaccinated covid patients a week. Around 20 or so die every month and it’s been consistent for years. Most of them boomers, some gen X, but nearly all of them unvaccinated and refuses Paxlovid because XYZ conspiracies.

However, we need to account for the big impact was the black & Latino community. (Edit for clarification: who historically vote dem.)

The death rate has decreased slightly from 2020, but it's still going to be about 0.98% this year, and maybe 0.97% next year. That's an extra 400,000 deaths in 2024 and 2025 over 2019 even though I don't think the CDC will count those as excess deaths anymore.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I liked her when she was running for senate. I had other choices ahead of her in the 2020 primary namely Elizabeth Warren, but still liked her. I felt like she disappeared as VP (as most do). This version of her has been incredible. I feel so much pride watching her speak and acting like a normal fucking person (much like Biden). 

I have a good feeling about Tuesday. Just hope everyone runs through the tape.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I didn't really have an opinion one way or the other.

But, I do remember watching the coverage after the Biden debate and wondering why no one was talking about her taking over. To me it seemed like the only alternative possible outside of Biden continuing.

I think that media misstep gave her an opportunity for a second ""first impression"" and that helped propel her campaign out of the gate. However, since then she has definitely taken control and done the best anyone could do.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

I was very skeptical of her campaigning abilities after the disaster of a campaign in 2020. But my God has she surprised me.

I’ve wondered quite a bit about how much of that doubt chorus etc was really just some veiled sexism … or even that idea will people actually elect a Black woman, is she smart enough etc. Honestly what this campaign shows is that you build consensus through successful campaigning, not the other way round, and that equality is built through giving chances",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"There were many Democrats, including many here in this sub, who didn't want Harris to be Biden's replacement. I was irritated by that because I didn't see a good reason why it shouldn't be her. I said repeatedly that it wouldn't make sense for the nominee to be anyone but her. I ~~hate~~ love to say ""I told you so!"" 🙂

"My ""honeymoon"" phase with her never ended once she entered the race. It's been really nice watching a competent person navigate all this. The reason you see a bit of fear in her eyes on the debate stage at the beginning or the impossibility of navigating the tight rope she must walk in interviews have its human foibles is because she's a human being who is morally minded. This much at least has been proven to me. 

I don't need my leaders to give great interviews and avoid gotcha moments. I need them to be morally minded with a pulse, and at least pretend to be accountable to ALL of your constituents.

"Nobody could talk about that until Joe himself accepted the truth. That was an uneasy but necessary period of time from the debate to him dropping out.

But him dropping out while endorsing her was the key, together with the string of endorsements that immediately followed. We would have probably been sunk if any viable Democratic challenger (that excludes Joe Manchin lol) had thrown their hat in the ring to challenge her and prolonged the change.

"Obama hesitated in his endorsement and I think he had the same initial concerns about the process, but a Biden-Trump rematch would have guaranteed a Trump victory.

"I know someone who worked for the state department and was involved in briefings.  Harris had a real rough first year as VP.  She ended up firing the majority of the staff she brought over from the Senate replacing them with more competent people.  She's demanding as in wanting all the relevant information and isn't afraid to ask questions and delve deeper.  That style of leadership requires a certain quality of subordinates.  I was impressed by her choice of Philip Gordon as National Security Advisor. Basically she Kamala did exactly what we should expect any elected official to do; step up and put in the work.  

 The sole exposure most people had to Harris before Biden stepped aside was her 2020 presidential campaign. I think concerns only natural.  She wildly exceeded my  expectations and I doubt I'm the only one.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

It is so on brand for Democrats to shoot themselves in the foot I was properly anxious they would fuck this up. But they handled it pretty well. And if Kamala wins, the way they did the transfer once Biden accepted he was stepping down from re-election will go down in American history as one of the smoothest fucking moves ever executed by a politician.

They played it perfectly since that moment, and turned the momentum of the entire race against Trump and the Republicans and finally gave Democratic voters someone to WANT to vote for. Not to mention the fact that she, Walz, and her campaign team - shout out to the social media and ‘zinger’ writers crew - who have smashed every pitch thrown their way out of the fucking park.

Many eventually presidents failed during their initial runs.  Trump ran under the reform and Biden ran in 1998, I didn’t do much research but there are probably many others.  So she failed her first try. She’s clearly gotten better, more prepared and she puts off an air of confidence but also someone who truly cares for people and the USA.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Anyone who saw the Democratic presidential debates in 2020, knows Harris is a badass.  I went into that debate hoping Warren would be the first female president, I left it KNOWING in my heart that it should and would be Harris.  Yay!",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"She's not stupid, I think we can both agree on at least that?

She KNOWS about the ""Palestine thing"".

There is very clearly a reason she's not taking a strong stance on it before election day, and it must be because internal data must show that it would be toxic to her campaign to take the leftist perspective on this.

She's showing obviously empathy, by saying she wants a ceasefire and a two state solution, but I imagine anything more extreme beyond that has not polled well in test groups or data analysis.

You have to remember that Israel defense funding is a BIPARTISAN effort. The president cannot just send money to a foreign power without Congress passing it with bipartisan support. This is an issue with both Democrats AND Republicans, and independents/moderate Republicans are absolutely repelled by harsh language towards Israel due to history.

Moderates/Republican swing voters are the demographic that will help her win this, not leftists.

So you have to look at it from a tactical POV and have and LITTLE bit of faith that she's not deaf and dumb. Read between the lines a bit.

Netanyahu doesn't want her to win. He's talked with Trump about delaying the ceasefire just to fuck her over. She skipped his speech to Congress outright and has a meeting with them that left him *bitter*.

She has needed to be smart about this, while also taking in to account that she literally is not in any position to do anything about it regardless.

I understand peoples' inclination to empathize with Palestinians, but this is about more than just Gaza. This is about our country too, and in order for Gaza to have any semblance of a chance, she needs to win, and if she wants to win, she needs to carefully skirt whatever tight rope her data is telling her to skirt, and frankly she's been a damn near trapeze artist on that front.

Tactical maneuvers take priority over purely righteous ones when you're up against an opponent who literally just lies in every breath, and when winning is of the UTMOST importance. I'd rather she be meh on Gaza and win, than have been a complete bonafide Pro-Palestinian candidate and lose. It's about the big picture.

That being said, I do not consider her ""missteps on Gaza"" to be actual missteps. No. It's all been a tactical maneuver. She did what she had to, without straight up lying to the public like Trump is doing.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I super appreciate the pragmatism, though, and I agree she can be better.

I do feel her and the team are competent and wonder if there is data suggesting that she maintain her current message on the issue since her mark hasn't moved all that much despite multiple chances to adjust. 

At the end of the day, more progressives need to start voting consistently so the campaigns can see that in their postmortem of the election and figure out what their message needs to be next election to keep those voters.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I think a big part of the reason Harris flamed-out in 2020 is that she really struggled with the dynamics of a primary.  Democractic Primaries are usually a race to left/progressive wing and the general is a race back to the center.  It's the same with GOP Primaries too and this is a big flaw in our political system that tends to deliver shitty candidates to the General Election.  The reason is that only the most engaged voters tend to vote in the primaries and those voters are overwhelmingly from the left/right wings of their own parties.

In 2020, she was trying so hard to keep one foot in the progressive wing and another foot anchored to the center that her remarks and answers to questions were muddled and she looked indecisive.   

To be fair, navigating the primaries vs. the general election is a very difficult political skill to pull off.  

She didn't have to deal with that dynamic this time and I think it made her a lot more comfortable on the campaign trail.

Also, despite her voting record being pretty progressive, she really is much more of a centrist than it appears.  I was all-in for her at the beginning of 2020 (I'm a California voter and have followed her career closely), but thought she was abysmal at campaigning. I never doubted her to be a competent executive.  I am very impressed with the discipline of her campaign since Biden dropped out.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

We are talking about close to 50% of the population who have become more radicalized and are moving to such extreme positions including inciting violence and sympathizing with our foreign enemies over fellow Americans.  Meanwhile the Democrats have remained fairly consistent in their general values of supporting workers against corporations, protecting the environment, minority rights/empowerment, sensible gun control,  LGBT rights, etc.  How far do Dems  bend to those who willingly ignore facts and truth, vote against their own interests and are hell bent on hurting you even physically if needed with sole goal of gaining full power over their fellow citizen enemies.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

First, it comes across as hypocritical coming from a draft dodger who has repeatedly denigrated the military. Second, this is a time where he desperately needs to convince outside voters that he is a capable leader. It is not a time to air grievances. Or try to settle grudges. This is yet another unforced error in the closing days of the campaign. And it is why he will lose.

For which I am very happy. As a conservative republican, I have grown tired of this idiot and his stupidity. He's a novelty act who got lucky in one election and has turned my beloved GOP into his cult of personality. It's long past time for him to go. Let him spend the rest of his days in Butner. New leadership needs to take hold or there won't be a Republican party in five years. It will take years to erase the damage done by Donald Trump.

She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with 9 barrels shooting at her, okay? Let's see how she feels about it, y'know, when the guns are trained on *her* face. Y'know they're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying 'Aw gee will- Let's, uh, send uh- Let's send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy.'""

I Hate Trump, but this is a shit clip. 

He’s talking about her being a war hawk and how that’s easy to do from Washington when you’re not the person in an active battle being shot at. He’s in no way threatening her or saying he’s going to put her in front of a firing squad as I keep saying. 

This is the bullshit that expands the maga base and divides the nation further. They see it and think “ this is clearly bullshit, I wonder what else they say is bullshit. Maybe all of its bullshit.” Trump gives you endless ammunition. Don’t fake outrage over nonsense.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

I dislike war-mongering pricks who send our friend and family to die, but I don’t suggest they should be thrown into the dirt with them and gunned down by terrorists in a war. Donald Trump clearly does.

Let’s take him at his word. He wants to put Liz Cheney in a war zone to prove a point. Are we accepting that? We’re gonna accept a US President being able to hand pick people to just get thrown into the military?

"You have given another ""here is what Trump really meant"" argument.

As I said in another comment, I understand what he was saying. Assuming that is what he meant, he can say it in a civilized way without the violent rhetoric that the MAGA group has been saying the Democrats have been saying since the two assassination attempts on Trump. The fact of the matter is that Trump has begun to use this violent rhetoric more and more often.

His word choice was purposeful to intimidate and has the effect of normalizing violent imagery. It has no place in our politics. It only encourages people with mental problems (potentially from both sides of the aisle) to do bad things... as Trump himself has found out.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"What doesn’t get discussed very often is the ultimate goal of ultra religious conservatives who installed Trump in 2016 for some conservative justices to overturn Roe.  

Project 2025 and the Heritage Foundation President have ties to Opus Dei.  Their vision for America is horrific.  

There is no doubt that conservatives’ hope is that Trump will get into office and he will either die of old age or get 25th’d.  And Vance will take the throne. In many ways, Vance is way worse than Trump. 

Deep down, these ultra religious conservatives who want to turn our country into a theocracy, despise Trump but he is a tool and a useful idiot.

In the video at the link below, Frank Schaefer, whose dad wrote the book, The Christian Manifesto, explains the history and roots of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society.

Her father gets a lot of attention for the Iraq War, but Liz Cheney is not her father.

No, suggesting your rivals be shot to death is NOT a ""classic argument"" used by the left. Link to anywhere any democrat candidate ever suggested their rival be shot to death for being a war hawk or any other reason. I've been waiting this whole time, nobody's provided any such citation.

the extremism that followed was not out of nowhere. it was a reactionary movement responding to a genocide, two groups in a power struggle with women’s bodies as the battlefield.  the ideology (at the time of the revolution) was explicitly Marxist with most of the language being anti colonial and anti capitalist.  the extremists filled a power vacuum and that was that, but that doesn’t mean the shah was a good guy or his administration friendly to women.   the women who were forced to give up their culture at the end of a police baton are also women even if you personally do not respect them or their choices",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Donald Trump: ""Well, I think it hurts Kamala a lot actually. Look, she's a deranged person, but the reason she couldn't stand me is that she always wanted to go to war with people. I don't want to go to war.
She wanted to go--she wanted to stay in Syria. I took them out. She wanted to stay in Iraq. I took them out. I mean, if we're up to her, we'd, we'd, be in 50 different countries.
She's a radical war hawk.

The same thing with the Wash Post and LA Times non-endorsements of Harris.  He is trying to intimidate people to get his way.  Same thing with the elections.  He'll pull whatever maneuver he can to get the vote count go his way or have it discounted.

The guy is a criminal who uses his PR skills and wealth to get whatever he wants.  The sick thing about this is that people who have these skills usually don't use them to further criminal activity, but rather to hone their career objectives.   Throw in the fact that he has wealth, and now you have a real problem.  He's managed to completely corrupt a major political party and bend it to his knee.  And now he has 47% of the country believing in him.

Now there are tyrants throughout history who were criminals with these skills....Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin.  But they didn't start out with the wealth this a-hole has; however these guys did obtain it later by controlling the state to their own devices.  And in each case, look what happened.

""As the audio clip circulates on the popular video app, Gen Z users are expressing their shock.

It’s been eight years since leaked audio from a conversation between Donald Trump and TV host Billy Bush made waves for the former president’s descriptions of kissing and grabbing women without their consent.

Now, young people are encountering the tape for the first time on TikTok, where users are sharing videos of their reactions and, in some cases, reaching large audiences.

Many first-time voters were young teens in 2016 when The Washington Post first reported the incident, in which the former president seemed to endorse sexual assault during a behind-the-scenes conversation on an “Access Hollywood” set when he didn’t realize his microphone was on. Despite widespread criticism of Trump’s comments at the time, he went on to win the 2016 presidential election, and the mainstream news cycle moved on.""",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Donald Trump is a buffoon.  He decides things on a whim with little to no evidence, plan of action, cohesive strategy, or international buy-in.  He did next to nothing useful diplomatically.  The PRC isn't some comic book villain like idk Hydra or something.  They are a vast nation-state fully integrated into the world economic system.

"Wait--you think that any man who squandered his enormous inheritance, has failed at every business he started, declared bankruptcy SIX times, has found multiple ways (jobs, universities, charities) to scam people who trusted him out of their money, has refused to pay employees and contractors who worked for him, who ran up the national debt, and left the U.S. economy much worse than he found it, with high unemployment and rising inflation that his successor then corrected, who bankrupted a *casino* for God's sake, and who cheats and lies as easily as he breathes would somehow improve or protect our economy? It's absolutely delusional to think that.

Read about the creators and producers of The Apprentice, who now admit that they created persona for him as a successful businessman, and found him to be a foolish, pompous, vain, stupid, and filthy idiot, who had to be propped up, cleaned up, and heavily edited for the screen. And then loosed him on the world.

"I never knew my parents politics as a teenager. My first presidential vote was for Obama in his second term. I missed the cutoff in 08 by a matter of days. Mostly, I listened to the people around me and their concerns. I looked at which political candidates worldview best aligned with mine. 

As someone who does theater and has lot of friends in the LGBT+ community, the choice was fairly clear. It didn’t hurt that while I grew up in a religious family (Catholic), religion was never something that I thought defined me. I also am mature enough to know the difference between belief and fact. Religious beliefs are just that, beliefs. No one religion has any more right to claim their beliefs to be true than anyone else. Whenever I hear people trying to push Christian ideology from the government, I always counter with something like “How would you feel if the Muslim community or Jewish communities were pushing their beliefs? If you were forced to give up bacon and go Kosher because a government official is Jewish. Or if your kids were forced to pray to Mecca in schools at designated times because of Muslim political leaders?” If any of those things were true, they’d be up in arms about it, but when Christians force their beliefs on others, somehow that’s ok. It doesn’t always work. Some of them see the hypocrisy, but most dismiss it because their beliefs are “true”. Regardless, my political opinions have always been my own. I don’t agree with everything the Democrats do, but their ideal world is much closer to my ideal world than the one being pushed by Republicans.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

* 1) Not even offer it at all (lower supply in America = higher prices for Americans, if so. Basic supply and demand)

* or 2) They will sell it to US importers... for $400, just like to anyone else.

"Oh no, they're angry, how rare and unexpected.  

Here's the bit these empathy-free, controlling, cruelty-bots skipped over:  ""If you feel you need to"".  

That's right.  If you feel your spouse would be angry, violent, or otherwise react poorly to how you choose to exercise your basic rights in this nation, you are not required to disclose your actions.  *If you need to*.  That's the premise.  

The only ones who would be keen on this, are the ones who find themselves attempting to be heard, while avoiding spousal abuse.  Because that's what we're talking about.  Whether physical or mental, it is still abuse if they are going to rage-fit your voting choice badly enough that it makes you want to keep it a secret.  

If your spouse is not abusive, and is tolerant of you having a similar or dissenting political view, then keeping it secret isn't important.  You can still do it, but it is less of a priority.  And in this case, your spouse is unlikely to even ask because of that first sentence in this paragraph - they likely already know your political stance.  We'd call that ""healthy communication"".  

They are angry because the Left is telling abused partners that they are allowed to keep their vote secret.

"An advert narrated by Julia Roberts encouraging women to keep their votes a secret from their husbands has triggered fury among Republicans.

“Remember, what happens in the booth, stays in the booth,” the actor says in the video encouraging women to cast their ballot for Kamala Harris.

“In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want. And no one will ever know,” she adds.

In the clip, two woman can be seen filling in their ballots before sharing a conspiratorial wink.

Conservatives branded it “nauseating” with Fox News host Jesse Watters suggesting the secrecy amounted to lying to your spouse.

Others mocked the idea that women needed to be reminded of the power of their vote.

Cheryl Chumley, a columnist for the Washington Times, called the advert “beyond condescending”.  “But then again, the story line plays right into how Democrats regard women who dare to vote conservative,” she wrote.

It is just the latest pitch by Democrats to women, with polls suggesting the White House race will be determined by a historically wide gender gap.

">Candace Fails screamed for someone in the Texas hospital to help her pregnant daughter. “Do something,” she pleaded, on the morning of Oct. 29, 2023.

>Nevaeh Crain was crying in pain, too weak to walk, blood staining her thighs. Feverish and vomiting the day of her baby shower, the 18-year-old had gone to two different emergency rooms within 12 hours, returning home each time worse than before.

>...

>Now on Crain’s third hospital visit, an obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to “confirm fetal demise,” a nurse wrote, before moving her to intensive care.

>By then, more than two hours after her arrival, Crain’s blood pressure had plummeted and a nurse had noted that her lips were “blue and dusky.” Her organs began failing.

>Hours later, she was dead.

"When my wife was pregnant the first time, we were vacationing in Montana and she miscarried at glacier national park. It was a terrible experience driving 90 miles to a hospital for “care”. The only thing I could think of was what are the abortion laws in Montana? Am I going to have to drive back to Minnesota so we can get the care we need if this miscarriage doesn’t go right? The PA that was the “doctor” in the ER didn’t seem to understand my question when I asked him what the abortion laws are in Montana. (This being a year after the fall of Roe) That was the scary part for me is knowing that some medical professionals hadn’t even begun to think about what the over throw of Roe could mean for them. 

Fast forward to her second pregnancy, my parents winter in Texas from Minnesota and we generally go down during Christmas time to spend 2 weeks with them. We kindly made it known that we would not be joining them as we will not be traveling to states that treat my wife as a second class citizen. 

I can’t imagine the feeling of hopelessness these women feel going to the hospital for help only to be turned away because you or the baby aren’t dead enough. So please any men that read this, please vote for your wife, daughters and any other female you are about. It could literally save their life.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I’m an ER RN and cases like this are why I moved from TX to CA with my family. The shit I had to see and ignore was awful.

Our entire OB department closed and cited the draconian laws as the reason. They’ve taken healthcare back 100 years.

Edit: when I’ve told people this they often “call bullshit.” I want to point out that until you’ve seen teenagers screaming until it sounds like a noise humans can’t make because they’re actively miscarrying and we legally can’t do anything, you can’t say “no you didn’t.” It’s not one or two cases, we had dozens and dozens.

"This is literally what the GOP is working towards making national policy. The death of a woman due to complications during pregnancy should be equated to murder and GOP lawmakers should be held responsible. Policy that values the life of unborn fetuses over the lives of grown, adult women is utterly insane. An aspiring mother can, in most cases, always try and make another baby if, and ONLY if, she's not first killed by backwards thinking and draconian policy that serves no one. Rather than losing a fetus that could be no more than 9 months old, the right would rather someone who already has a life, known to many, and loved by dozens dies.

The GOP cannot claim any moral highground when they let women die like this. Not only that, they also don't give a *shit* about a child after it's born. They want to defund schools, ban books, and protect guns. They don't have to worry about the consequences of this because the rules they make for us don't apply to them. They'll happily let an abortion happen if it's convenient to them. For their kids that are born already, they won't go to school with our kids, where they'd be exposed to the middle and lower classes or, god forbid, non-whites, if they're not gunned down before lunch first.

Abortion needs to be legal because fully grown adult woman have the right to determine what risks they are willing to subject their body to. 

On day one of an infant's life, you couldn't compel a woman to have something as simple as a goddamn blood test, even if doing it would save the life of her infant.

It is not ""both sides"".  The country did indeed fail her and she is dead,  but it is the 30% of the country that did this, and the fact is that the 70% majority just could not save her.

"Maybe this is cynical of me but I'm somewhat surprised that Irish folks rallied so hard around the death of an immigrant woman because I'm sure the same kind of support would not be given in America with how xenophobic it has become.

The first three deaths reported on by Propublica were of Black and Latina women and I have to wonder if their deaths didn't matter to conservatives because the women were not White and they find a way to blame the victims. The two Black women died of complications after medication abortions for undesired pregnancies and they'd probably say that it was the medication's fault or the women's fault for not wanting their pregnancies. The Latina woman was an immigrant and half of America if not more hates immigrants right now. The most recent reported death was of a White woman, but as a teenager she was barely a woman and I wonder if some would think ""that's what she gets for having sex so young before marriage.""

There would need to be some sort of ""perfect victim"" for conservatives to care - a wealthy, married, middle-aged White woman who was already a mother and had a wanted pregnancy but died after being denied miscarriage care, and with a family who was willing to speak out and press politicians on the issue. The thing is, these women probably have a greater chance of actually getting needed care, as opposed to lower-income or younger women of color. As long as it's people conservatives don't care about who are dying, they will continue to be fine with it.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"> There was no spousal rape because women were property to be used.

Trump's first wife, Ivana, claimed he violently pulled her hair out and raped her after getting hair plugs, because they hurt him too bad and she referred the doctor that did the procedure.

His lawyers at the time convinced her that marital rape wasn't a thing and she retracted her story.

>Back in 2015, Mak was writing about claims that Trump raped his first wife, Ivana.

They might have experienced an issue with their cord or placenta. The doctor, trying to be kind, might have casually and humanely suggested that termination was the most humane option for the pregnant person and their fetus. They may have just said, “I suggest getting a dilation and cutterage” or something like that. They probably didn’t use the term abortion.

They said the X-rays were reviewed by the Radiologist and that she was fine. She was stable so they discharged her. When we asked about her mouth and jaw they said they weren't dentists and refused to treat that. They didn't even clean up the blood or try to get the broken teeth out of her mouth. To be honest it is a miracle she didn't get an infection and die from that.

She saw an orthodontist less than a week later and was immediately scheduled for surgery to try to do what they could with the injury but it had already healed too much. She has been in pain ever since. She just got replacement teeth 15 years later. Countless surgeries to try to make the situation better. But since it was Workman's comp they had to exhaust every other option.

She tried to sue the hospital for the obvious malpractice. After she had seen the orthodontist the hospital radiologist called her and said to see a doctor immediately. But that didn't matter at all. They stabilized her and that is all their obligation is. It is their discretion to treat anything beyond that.

You view pregnancy and motherhood as a consequence for choosing to have sex and you want to enforce that consequence. In cases of rape, the mother didn't choose to have sex, and therefore the consequences of pregnancy and motherhood don't need to be enforced.

They reluctantly agreed, but only after threatening that our insurance probably wouldn't pay for the testing if it didn't turn out to be the gallbladder.

So they checked, and wouldn't you know it, they had to quickly get her into surgery to remove her gallbladder.  We ended up requesting the notes the doctor took and they sent them to us.

I've only had one pleasant experience with an ER doctor, and that was because my issue was obvious.  I had a nasty wound from where a horse had kicked me on my shin.  You could see my shin bone.  We seriously consider driving hours away to a different hospital each time we need to go there because of how badly our local hospital treats us.

She knows what the consequences of sex are."" They view unwanted pregnancy as a ""punishment"" or ""consequences"" (their preferred word, because they know how crazy punishment sounds) for having sex and/or having sex without being responsible enough to properly use birth control.  They can concede that if it was a rape, it wasn't the woman's ""fault"" so she shouldn't get her punishment. Of course they have a very narrow definition of rape...pretty much just a stranger jumping out of the bushes and attacking. They wouldn't see something like sexual pressure/coercion by an abusive husband or boyfriend as rape so women in those cases still have to have their ""consequences."" 


As a side note, they also believe the rape must be reported to police to get the reprieve from the consequences.

">I don't understand how people rationalize this. Like, if you think abortion is murder, why are you okay with murdering a baby if the father is a rapist?

It's an admission that their desire to ban abortion is exactly 0% motivated by desire to ""protect"" anything; and 100% motivated by a desire to punish women.

The **only** difference in this scenario is that they think they're being ""gracious"" and ""moderate"" by saying that a woman who didn't *choose* to have sex is less deserving of punishment than one who did.

When a misogynist makes this argument, they have *permanently disqualified* themselves from making the vast majority of quote-unquote ""pro-life"" arguments ever again.

If they proceed to talk about believing that fetuses are ""babies"", you can immediately dismiss them as a fucking liar, because they've **already admitted** that *they don't actually believe that*.


If they proceed to talk about believing that abortion is ""murder"", you can immediately dismiss them as a fucking liar, because they've **already admitted** that *they don't actually believe that*.


If they proceed to talk about believing their policies are motivated by a desire to ""protect innocents"", you can immediately dismiss them as a fucking liar, because they've **already admitted** that *they don't actually believe that*.

When they realize that their attempts to present themselves as a ""moderate"" Nazi aren't fooling anyone and their mask falls all the way off, they have nowhere to retreat to, because they're already torched their *next* argument. Sadly, this isn't going to slow them down much, because, as mentioned above, they are **fucking liars** who want to hurt you for the sake of hurting you.

Owens made the TikTok to join in on a trend of women disclosing that they’re voting against their partners’ preferred candidates. In one video, a woman mischievously tucks away a strand of hair as she mails in her ballot, “proudly” canceling out her boyfriend’s ballot – “because someone paid attention in US History & has to care about keeping the Dept of Education!!!!” In another, a woman dances to Ciara’s Level Up before driving off to “cancel out” her “Trump loving Husband’s vote in a swing state”.

"There was an article earlier this year about the return of full fledged sharia law in Afghanistan with the Taliban’s most recent announcement that it is resuming publicly stoning women to death for adultery. They have systematically eliminated right after right in the name of religion and noone has stepped up to stop it or speak out for the women. For a country that actually gave women the right to vote in 1919 before even the US, women are now completely completely without power there. No right to vote, no right to education past 6th grade, no right to work, or even to go anywhere without male supervision and now stoning and death death based on whatever definition of a crime that the men decide to give.  A quote from one of the leaders was chilling. He said, “You may call it a violation of women’s rights when we publicly stone or flog them for committing adultery because they conflict with your democratic principles,” he said, adding: “But I represent Allah [God], and you represent Satan.”

These trumpers who scream about evil muslims taking over are on the road to their own US version of this. People joke about Y'allQaeda  but their maga message is actually chillingly similar to that of those they claim to hate. They are just using the name of a different god to justify it.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Several things worry me about this “trend”.

If women are secretly cancelling out their husband/partner’s vote, is it really a healthy relationship? I have seen multiple comments to this trend that advocate divorce instead of secrecy and lying. I realize not all women are in a place in their lives where divorce is an easy or safe option. Many women are trapped, financially and physically into a marriage where physical or verbal abuse is common. If the orange turd loses, their husband/parter make take it out on the women. 

I am in a 20 year marriage to a wonderful woman that has a mind of her own, but is usually aligned with me on an ideological line. We argue from a point of Leftist vs. Progressive on a lot of issues, but I’m much more conservative when it comes to fiscal matters. I love my wife and respect her decisions. Unfortunately, not all women are able to speak their mind freely without the threat of verbal, emotional or physical abuse. 

I’m just saying to be careful, y’all.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

I drive past two temples on my way to work and another looms outside my window, even as I write this. I've seen how the church affects the lives of my friends and my friends' parents, and it casts an omnipresent shadow on every interaction I've ever had. I have registered as a republican to vote against the worst option in almost every primary and have sat in my high school library during a caucus and watched a video about the 'party platform of family values' so I could vote for Nickie Haley against Trump in this election. I have talked with young women who come from Young Women's studies and how they are instructed to ""Marry a returned missionary in the Church."" I have talked with young men and about the pressure they're under to go on a mission and return to marry a young woman, in the temple, after their mission. I know people that have followed this route and people that have deviated from it. I know how both are treated. I attended a seminary and listened to my fellow male students say that, if it were up to them, their 'future brides' wouldn't be allowed to date at all before they were married. Besides my mother, I have exactly one relative I see frequently who isn't a member of the church and she is even more religiously zealous than the Mormons I know. I know that my niece is the \*sole\* female relative I have that is explicitly pro choice. The next most supportive is my mother. But she's \*deeply\* ambivalent and would sellout the issue in a heartbeat for something she actually cared about. And I sat through election night in 2016 and watched McMullen slide of nearly half of Trump's support in the vote total... And watched Trump still walk away with a landslide victory.

"The commenter above you is right, though. And it isn't cowardly to see or explain it - it's the *reality* of what is going on. 

For most people (at least prior to 2020) politics was a small piece of their lives. They paid almost no attention and thus never developed a sense of what is ""normal"" in politics or global or economic affairs. They didn't have to, they had elected officials to do that for them. But this meant they were ill prepared to take in and weigh the firehose of misinformation shot at them from every side: TV, social media, friends, family, church. How do you distinguish between ""Biden controls gas prices"" and ""Biden meets with OPEC"" when you have no idea what is actually in control of the presidency, how gas prices work, or who OPEC is? You don't. You can't. So you rely on the voices around you who speak with confidence on the topic and - out of intellectual laziness - adopt those opinions as your own. Those opinions are then reinforced every where you turn. Until ""Biden raises gas prices to pay for immigrants to come take your job"" sounds like fact to you. You're still not really interested in politics so you hear the exaggerated snipits from Fox and Facebook and decide that's all you need to know 

At some point you start to think ""Maybe Biden didn't do that and all these people are wrong?"" But you think you're the only one with these doubts. For years now you've heard your community talk about ""libs"" as if they are sent from the devil and deserving of physical punishment. How stupid would it be for you to say ""actually, I've defected from this little cult and am switching to the other side""??? You'd lose your friends, family, possibly your business depending on your situation. And for what? You publicizong your defection won't change their minds. It will only hurt you, badly. But you can still do what's right and vote for Harris behind closed doors without risking ruining your life.

That's the reality for a HUGE number of people in pro-Trump neighborhoods. And, like the Catholic Church and the Mormon Church, you don't know that those same doubts exist in the hearts of all your fellows because fear of consequences for even *thinking* differently keeps you all quiet even from one another.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Hmmm. You might have a point. I can see this peer pressure effect being real as a matter of human psychology -- which is sadly irrational, because if there are fewer voters, your vote is more impactful, so smaller turn out should encourage voting by making each voter more important to the outcome.

> also down ballot implications and choices as well.

"Here's his official endorsement: [Why I’m Voting for Kamala Harris](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-10-31/michael-bloomberg-why-i-m-voting-for-kamala-harris)

> I do not agree with Vice President Kamala Harris on every issue, but earlier this week, I voted for her without hesitation. I’d like to explain why, in hopes that others who have a history of supporting candidates in both parties — as I do — will join me.

> As I’ve thought about the candidates in this presidential election, I’ve been guided by two main considerations: policy positions and personal integrity.

> When it comes to policy, the contrast could not be clearer.

> And that brings us to the other consideration: personal integrity.

> As former Vice President Mike Pence and many other Republicans have concluded, Trump is not fit for high office. Not after refusing to accept the will of the people and trying to steal the 2020 election — first by attempting to strong-arm state legislators and election officials into overturning the results, and then, when that failed, by bamboozling people into attacking the Capitol to stop the counting of Electoral College ballots.

> He made our country, the world’s greatest nation, look like a banana republic. Most Americans never thought we’d witness such a shameful episode. Trump, rather than apologizing for it — as some of those convicted of Jan. 6-related crimes have done — celebrates it.

> Why? Because for him, nothing — not America, not our Constitution, not democracy, not the rule of law, not the lives of police officers or any other citizen — matters more than his own vanity and glory.

"Specifically about your concerns about publications and endorsements: America is going through another great realignment. The factions that make up the two lead parties are shifting considerably into new arrangements. That means leaders and institutions of some factions that used to be core to the parties are now on the outside - whether they want to admit it or not.

That's why you see union leaders supporting Trump while business Republicans are lining up behind Harris. In the current flux, both unions and business communities are swing voters - a wild first to have both groups ""on the outside"" of each coalition. 

It takes a little while for the dust to settle in these realignments. My suspicion, and Trump's conviction, is that the bulk of the business community and business-focused politicians will mostly move to the Democrats, while ""union voter"" ceases to be a thing, with union members not primarily voting based on treatment of unions or promotion of the union cause as a whole as a first priority. 

At times like this, endorsements from faction leaders and associated institutions count for far less, as they can represent factions who are no longer relevant to the voters they are trying to persuade. 

There's also the small matter that MAGA operates less as a political coalition and more as a messianic religious movement, in which its far easier to ignore dissident voices.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

One is that the 65+ demographic is bluer than you'd think. Especially ones that'd trust mail-in voting.

My fellow democrats, including 99.9% of Redditors, aren’t smart enough to understand the other side. That’s why they don’t understand how the election is close let alone how Trump can win. That’s WHY the democratic party is doing such a poor job this election. The campaign is focusing on the issues THEY care about and not what voters care about. 

Take black men, for example. Dems are pushing the tired racist tropes instead of talking about the economy and wage growth. Black men feel like they’re being plucked off the plantation and given a small nugget to get them to vote how Dems want instead of appealing to their needs.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Kamala Harris has a [big lead over Donald Trump](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/11/01/kamala-harris-donald-trump-us-election-latest/) among American voters who say they have already cast their ballots, polls show.

The Democratic nominee had an advantage of 19 to 29 points over her Republican rival, according to tallies by ABC News-Ipsos, New York Times-Siena College and CNN.

The lead is larger than the one Hilary Clinton had over [Donald Trump](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/did-joe-biden-call-trump-supporters-garbage-election/) in the run up to the 2016 election, when polls showed the Democratic nominee leading with 8 to 16 points.

[Joe Biden](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/30/us-election-live-donald-trump-kamala-harris/) had a greater margin in late 2020 polls when Democrats embraced mail voting, while Trump attacked it and persuaded his supporters not to do it.

Polling shows that Ms Harris has a significant advantage in swing states, where the two parties have similar levels of support and where the outcome of the election will be decided.

According to polls from Marist, CNN, Fox News and USA Today-Suffolk University, Ms Harris leads among early voters in the key battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

[Only in Nevada](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/voters-fled-california-could-win-nevada-donald-trump/) does any major poll indicate an early [Trump swing state advantage](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/01/washington-picked-right-president-donald-trump-election/), with a CNN study showing a six-point lead.

There has been Republican excitement over increased levels of early voting by their supporters, which led [Elon Musk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/01/democrats-campaign-strategy-using-elon-musk-x-trump/) to declare that Trump was “trending towards a crushing victory”.

Four years ago, Trump was vehemently opposed to early and mail-in voting, saying it was vulnerable to fraud. This time around, Trump and Republican party officials have adapted their messaging to encourage supporters to cast their ballots before election day on Tuesday.

Mr Musk’s prediction was based on a comparison from Pennsylvania of 2024 vote-by-mail turnout against turnout levels from this point in the 2020 race, which showed registered Republicans making up 32 per cent of the early vote compared with 21 per cent in 2020.

Early voting data tends to favour Democrats as the party encourages its supporters to [cast their ballot early](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/us-presidential-election-2024-when-dates-candidates-voting/) so less is left to chance on election day.

Women are also voting early in large numbers and Democrats, who have made reproductive rights [a central campaign issue](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/us-election-donald-trump-kamala-harris-november-5-issues/), see the female vote as key to a Harris victory.

According to the University of Florida’s Election Lab, 54 per cent of the 60 million Americans who have already voted are women.

Ms Harris led Trump by 12 points among female voters in October, according to an analysis of Reuters/Ipsos polls.

Experts have warned [against over-interpreting early polling data](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/election-superstitions-people-think-determine-white-house/), as the subsamples of those who say they have already submitted their ballot have larger margins of error.

Mail-in and early voting began at scale in the US during the Civil War, but has seen a significant expansion since 2000. Most states offer in-person and mail voting though options vary.

"This suggests a fair amount of R crossover and NPA breaking for Harris. But let’s be honest, this is what we were expecting.

I think the polls were picking up a lot of males who would vote Trump but might not turn out in great numbers inc on election day. This would produce quite a swing across the map to Harris

Literally 1-2% swings each way can decide the election,  so any of these early vote predictions with massive error margins ate kind of useless.  Don't pay attention to it.

He’s turned off all reasonable people, and a lot of republicans are either reaching across the aisle or not voting. Very few Dems are voting for Trump. Furthermore, Trump killed a lot of his supporters through his terrible Covid response.

At the end of the day though, if Harris loses, no riots will happen. You cannot in good faith say the same about your side if Trump loses. You pretty much are already rejecting any result that isn’t a Trump win, which is what he wants",2024_11_02,05_26_36

States shouldn't have a say in any health decisions it should be up to a doctor and the person it directly affects, not you and not a state government Did you know that it is still  dangerous  to carry a baby. Women still die in childbirth, even in healthy pregnancies. Some people don't even have access to healthcare. So yes abortion is absolutely awful. It truly is, especially if you are the one that needs one. And maybe if women's health care gets taken seriously and things change for the better.

By contrast, in Florida they do all the prep work before Election Day. They open the envelopes as they come in, unfold the ballots, check the signatures, put them in stacks that can quickly and easily be run through the scantron machines, etc. Then on Election Day, they can tally those votes first thing in the morning, so by the time the polls close the SoS can publish the early vote immediately.

Not that they won't try",2024_11_02,05_26_36
">Republicans who are showing up early can't show up again on Election Day. If you assume a 5% defection from Republicans in swing states and that Independent voters go 60/40 to Dems (both of which I think are fair if not underestimating it), then it is 56/44 dems in swing states that share party affiliation votes.

What if you assume something else though? Assume defections favor Harris by 2% overall, and ""independents"" - whoever that is these days - turn out to be 55/45 for Trump because they don't like the sound of all the pet eating and sex changes for kids that they indirectly heard Kamala supports via casual consumption of Fox while in the waiting room of a doctor's office? What do your numbers say then?

Edit to add:
I don't think we know what's working out there. I like Redditors, but we are an echo chamber. I want to believe the country is sick of Trump's bullshit. A month ago, I was convinced it was. But I'm a liberal surrounded by liberals in my city, state, and online communities, and 90%+ of the political discussion over the last 4 weeks has been what Trump just said or did. That kind of obsession, even if it's generally negative, seems like it makes him more viable. 

I wish we would all talk and share more about what Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are doing & pledging to do to make America better than it ever has been.

I'm a ""liberal"" surrounded by conservatives, everywhere, and I am an independent by (non) affiliation. 

There are some very worrying signs (for Trump) in my anecdotal experience of my deeply red area. Farmers and rural-living people are turning toward Harris/Walz at what appears to be an appreciable rate. 

We'll see if it's true or a mirage, but truthfully all the bullshit that comes out about Trump tends to turn would-be Republican voters off in a way that leads to disengagement or even crossing their vote altogether, not so much making him seem 'more viable'. I'd argue that it drives more votes against him because people just want it all to go away.

Bernie Moreno in Ohio is turning a LOT of people off with his bullshit as well. I know several Trump/Brown voters, which is odd... but Moreno is so hung up on demonizing trans people that he is losing his audience.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

From your lips to God's ears, my man.

Reddit may be an echo chamber, but a lot of the people in this echo chamber know Republicans who are voting for Harris. 

""Bernie Moreno in Ohio is turning a LOT of people off with his bullshit as well""

I'm not a conservative, and the odds of me voting for a conservative ever again, for the rest of my days, is just about zero. But I believe strongly that our nation needs a sane, stable conservative movement. In a surprising way, Trump poses a real threat to the GOP, because the people who rise to the top when Trump is around (Moreno, that lunatic in NC, etc.) are *deeply* unpopular to the vast majority of people. That old chestnut from Lindsay Graham (""Trump will destroy us"") could come true if he wins in 2024. And as much as I don't like the GOP, I don't think that's a good thing, because what would replace it would be a very destructive party.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

I live in the area and again this is all wishful ancedotes but there's a lot more Harris signs and about the same amount of Trump signs here in Oakland County which was \~ 56% Biden last time. 

Also we've elected a female Governor and AG against a trump backed anti-abortion woman in the 2022 election and she lost pretty handily. I know that is very different but again it's better than me saying a Trump backed anti abortion woman lost by 0.5% or won even in 2022. Then I'd be worried.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

The bulk of jobs created in the past 3 years were in rural areas. Farmers and ranchers were completely fucked when Trump gave the industry over to the big monopolies. I’m not expecting a huge defection or anything, but the enthusiasm for Trump out here is absolutely nothing like 2016 or 2020. 

As far as the GOP goes, my money is on Independents stepping up. More people are registered as independent, Indies in areas like NE-02 and Utah are putting up extremely competitive races in otherwise very red areas.

No guarantees of course, but a lot of the little factors that make a difference in a state like this have been getting attention. This is the first cycle I haven't felt like the Dems weren't really doing enough to truly win the state, they are serious about it without a doubt.

"It wasn’t ineptness, not on its own. He did things out of spite and vanity and malice that may have been the worst part of it. 

- Withheld lifesaving equipment from blue states out of spite

- Seized PPE for his grifter friends to then profit off of

- Sent ventilators to Russia when we badly needed them

- Refused to wear a mask and encouraged others not to because Trump did not like the way they looked on him and messed up his hair and makeup. This one may be the worst because he turned it into a political loyalty test whether you masked and socially distanced even before we had a vaccine, when hospitals and morgues were still overflowing. 

He may have set back trust in medicine for generations by politicizing public health policy. Remember what he did to Fauci? He basically made half of America hate him as some sort of mad scientist trying to make women sterile and men impotent. Remember the tracking chips rumor? People still talk about that stuff.

Think about that. 450,000 people who didn’t have to die a fairly horrific death on a ventilator unable to see their loved ones. That was with Fauci as his advisor. Now he wants put RFK Jr in charge of Americas health. To suggest putting a vaccine denier in charge of America’s heath should in and of itself disqualify Trump from the presidency.

Each president since Clinton, worked to build our national defenses against such a threat.

"In addition to the response, which was at best criminally negligent, it's worth noting that if Trump isn't President, it's entirely possible there's no pandemic at all. In 2015, Obama created the National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, colloquially known as the ""Pandemic Response Team,"" in response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak. The team consisted of communicable disease experts and their goal was ""to be the smoke alarm"" for emerging epidemics. They had an office in Wuhan, historically a hotspot for communicable disease outbreaks (probably in large part due to its population density and prominent ""wet market"").

Trump, out of an apparent desire to undo everything Obama had done out of pure spite, tried to fire them almost immediately upon taking office. Upon learning he couldn't do that, he had his crony in charge of the NSC defund them to the point of having to eliminate the team in 2018.

Could an intact team dedicated to the task have prevented the disease from expanding as far as it did by working with the people in Wuhan? Impossible to say. Maybe not. But they could have absolutely gotten the ball rolling to getting us ahead of the curve on producing tests, which are crucial components to proven response techniques like track & trace. Start testing anyone with any unknown respiratory ailments and it's absolutely possible we get control of it right away.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

**This BS Killed My Dad**

And sad and overwhelmed. All this made worse by this lingering feeling my mother is being cruel to be cruel because of her own mental health issues she refuses to get help for.

Covid took whatever little time he had left here. We didn't see eye to eye on politics, but he was still my Dad. He was hiding how sick he was on top of it, under some idea ""silence is protecting my daughter."" Ugh. Then I had to deal with nasty nurses towards the end. It's been a shit show really.

I was vaxxed so I wasn't scared to be with my Dad. I just hate that this ideology has taken the people we love from us.

Body and mind.

I tried so hard to nudge him towards getting vaccinated. I know it's not my fault and I did everything I could. My parents had me a bit older in life and despite our differences I cherished the time I had with him. Just so sad that politics of all things could have torn us apart over the years or made him think less of his children. My brother is also far left opposite of my father.

My Dad raised me to be honest and have integrity, to mean what I say and keep my word as best I can. It broke my heart to see him just go right along with a lying bully with no respect for women.

He called himself, ""Fiscally conservative, socially progressive"" as a kid. But FOX destroyed his rationality over the years and made him ripe for QAnon seed planting. I hope wherever he is, should we go somewhere (which I think we do) I hope he realizes what happened to him and drags the mf who killed him down to hell.

My Dad had an angry streak in life however I never saw him become so hateful until this MAGA nonsense. It was like they just knew what to poke to make people lose reason. He was a brilliant man and even he was not immune to the danger of party lines over everything.

> After the Influenza Pandemic of 1918 killed 675,000 people in the U.S., it became known as the &quot;Forgotten Pandemic,&quot; because governmental and scientific institutions, along with the public, largely stopped talking about it, said George Dehner, a historian at Wichita State University who studies public health.

> According to a study published in The Lancet, the Covid-19 death rate in the U.S. was 40% higher than it was in similar high-income countries, and the Trump Administration&#039;s undermining of science and public health agencies directly &quot;Impeded the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, causing tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths.""

> The denial, confusion and misinformation that was so characteristic of the pandemic response also made it more challenging for the public to remember what happened.

So it ended up being one of RFK's grandson blew the whistle on all this and told Congress.

>“I knew from that room that he was saying things that just weren’t true,” he said. Trump told the public that the government was doing all it could, but the P.P.E. emergency was being managed by a handful of amateurs. “It was the number of people who show up to an after-school event, not to run the greatest crisis in a hundred years,” Kennedy said. “It was such a mismatch of personnel. It was one of the largest mobilization problems ever. It was so unbelievably colossal and gargantuan. The fact that they didn’t want to get any more people was so upsetting.”

Seems ironic that these are the people who are often anti-vax. More of them died and caused many more others to die as well because of that. They want to forget how Trump screwed up badly by giving out misinformation and by downplaying it while they themselves were part and party to making it worse as well. What's funny is the data reflects that the anti-vax conservatives mostly had their minds made well before the vaccine was available and prior to the 2020 election.,2024_11_02,05_26_36

"As a hospital-based physician who treated COVID patients from the start of the pandemic, this is the one aspect of his administration in which I'm willing to cut Trump some slack. Shit was crazy in March 2020. No one was sure how bad it was going to be, estimates of case fatality rates spanned 2 orders of magnitude, no one knew of any successful therapies, and different experts were giving wildly differing recommendations on how the government should respond. 

The US was going to get slammed by the pandemic in spring 2020 no matter who was occupying the White House. Yes, it would have been better had there been someone not as inept as Trump (who reportedly ignored the Obama administration's ""Pandemic Playbook""), but it wouldn't have been a night vs. day difference. 

There were plenty of other aspects of his administration which were far far less excusable.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I've said it a million times if he had handled the covid crisis with just a little bit of brains he wins the next election in a walk.

God bless the United States of America""",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"On the day he left office America had 4% of the world's population & 20% of the COVID deaths, at 400,000 dead Americans.

That means 4 out of 5 COVID deaths in 2020 could've been prevented with **merely an average** response, 320,000 people, dead.  Actually the number's worse than that.  Had America mustered an average response, they wouldn't have dragged down the world's average.  It's closer to 333,000 dead Americans.

This has been, and always will be why Republicans will never take COVID seriously, why they cleave desperately to every ridiculous conspiracy theory about the vaccine.  They can rationalize everything else.  He's a fascist?  He's **their** fascist.  Sexually assaulting over a dozen women?  Overturning Roe?  Most of them are men, who cares?  Separating immigrant children?  Cops murdering unarmed black motorists?  They're not immigrants and they're not black.

Presidents have always had very little impact on the economic condition of the country.  Even FDR with all his programs, could not get us out of the depression.  It was WW2 that did that.  Reagan oversaw a stock market crash in 1987 and there was nothing he could do.  The only good thing that came out of that was new rules to stop trading when the market slides a certain percentage.

We are still in recovery from COVID.  Biden has not control over the Federal Reserve which sets the borrowing rate.

It takes a long time to recover and people need to recognize that.  Kamala has pointed out a few things that amount to price gouging.  And so industry can keep things more expensive than they should be.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Weird?  In the context of the current political madness, I wouldn’t call it weird so much as frustrating.

MAGA didn’t need to forget cuz they thought it was a hoax and Trump handled everything perfectly anyway and it was all Biden’s fault, etc.

As for the rest of us, I think human’s just tend to fixate on whatever is in front of them in the moment.  We’ve had so much shit going on, Trump trials, wars in Ukraine and Gaza, hurricanes, election drama, Roe getting overruled, inflation… the list goes on and on.

But the pandemic really is an important piece of context for the economic impacts we’ve suffered.  Over the last 4 decades the GOP has done a fantastic job of selling the idea that they are fiscally responsible and Democrats are the ones frivolously spending our tax dollars and blowing up the budget and that Democratic policies are responsible for any economic woes.  Polls consistently demonstrate that a majority of voters trust the GOP more on economic policy, despite ample evidence that Democratic administrations have historically produced more stable and healthy economies than GOP ones.

So it’s super frustrating to deal with all of the attacks on the Biden admin over inflation that ignore the root causes of the problem and just lean on the established perception that Dems are bad at fiscal policy.  We had a pandemic.  Morgues were overflowing in big cities and bodies were being stored in refrigerated trucks.  States were issuing mandates for closing restaurants and bars and other non-essential public spaces and people were being forced to stay at home without income.  The government had the option of letting them starve, lose their homes, etc. or hand out free money to help them get through it.  We opted for the latter and there was a price to be paid for that.

Then we had Putin timing his invasion right after Biden took office and working to sabotage energy production and transport in western Europe.  And our lovely friends in OPEC seeing an opportunity to squeeze the west for more money.  So while we were facing the consequences of Covid we also had to deal with spiking energy costs.  Which in turn gave corporate America a perfect screen to profiteer with a bit of price gouging cuz everything was getting more expensive anyway.  All of which is conveniently Biden’s fault.  

And who denied that Covid was in the US until the proof was impossible to ignore because he didn’t want to rock the economic boat during an election?  Who encouraged his supporters to reject the advice and best practices with social distancing, avoiding large gatherings, wearing masks in public, and even taking the vaccine once it became available, thereby worsening and extending the impact of the pandemic?  Who hoarded critical medical supplies when they were desperately needed by largely blue population dense areas?  Not Biden, that’s who.

IMO the Biden/Harris campaign would have made a much more convincing case for continuing to entrust the Democratic party if they had leaned into the GOP attacks by openly embracing the significance of the inflation and turning it into an attack on Trump and his pandemic policies, arguing that the economic repercussions were unavoidable and that the administration made proverbial lemonade and managed to get us through the mess as quickly as possible.  I think hearing the admin validate the hardship instead of trying to deflect and avoid as much as possible would have been more reassuring to the voters who are primed to see Democrats as out of touch and prioritizing “sentimental” issues over pragmatic ones.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

*****
> Vice President Kamala Harris is regaining ground with Latino voters after seeing a dip in support earlier this election cycle, holding her lead among Latino voters over former President Donald Trump, according to a new survey of Hispanic voters.

> A New York Times/Siena College poll published in October found Harris at 56% nationally with Latino voters, while Trump was at 37%. Both candidates in the last few weeks have ramped up last minute outreach to Latino voters - with Harris in mid-October announcing an &quot;Hombres con Harris&quot; outreach effort and releasing an economic agenda for Latino men.

> Harris and Democrats have tried to capitalize on the remarks to appeal to more Latino voters and make up ground with the key voting group.

Then he dared me to go tell a Venezuelan to their face that I’m “a communist” (I’m not. I’m a socialist) and that Democrats aren’t that bad.

Funny thing is that I proceeded to walk up to my Venezuelan coworker later on and told her what my dad told me, and she told me he was full of shit lol

He hates the idea that Dems are trying to tax him higher and steal his money so they can give it out to lazy poor people from the hood.

What can I say?

"No. I don’t know Trump personally. The reason I can confidently state Cuban’s comments are anecdotal is that they only know each other publicly, not privately (in the way you “know” a person you’ve spent cordial time getting to know).

Cuban’s knowledge of Trump is based on a mixx of **business ** acquaintance, **public** interactions, and at times, rivalry, **but never one-one one private time…**

Mark Cuban, a billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, first encountered Trump in the early 2000s when both were prominent figures in the business and media worlds. Trump and Cuban crossed paths as outspoken, high-profile personalities, with Cuban being especially active in sports and business commentary, while Trump expanded his brand through “The Apprentice” reality TV series .

During Trump’s presidency (2016–2020), Cuban became an outspoken critic of Trump’s policies and leadership style. Cuban, who at times hinted at a possible run for office, voiced strong opinions against Trump’s approach to various issues. Trump, in turn, responded with public statements, leading to occasional public exchanges of criticism between the two  . 

**None of this Qualified s Cuban’s opinion as anything more than “anecdotal.”**

">Another point of proof that Harris has the momentum is where Trump and Harris are heading in the closing days.

Finally, on Monday, he will hold a rally in Raleigh, the capital of the Tar Heel state.

>Trump and his running mate JD Vance have gone all-in on North Carolina, the one swing state Trump won in 2020.

Instead, the campaign finds itself shoring up its support there.

My heart is still concerned, but my mind is almost at ease.  Logically Trump is looking like  he has no viable path to victory, other than a coup.

"I don’t know that if that many are going to defect. The media play up the well known defecting republicans, but I wonder if they only defect because they are having to answer interview questions — so they are seeking out facts and real information so they don’t sound like a dumbass. But the average Republican, not even just MAGA, doesn’t watch much news outside of Fox and other conservative media - they are told constantly that anything that contradicts them is a lie. This truly is a huge cult and they refuse to see it, because their media makes a shit ton of money convincing them this fantasy of Trump is real. They are so willing to hand over their pocketbooks if it means they get to stay a part of this manufactured movement. 

I think one of the biggest issues is that we so often don’t have discussions just to keep the peace. So a lot of people just agree to disagree and no one gets to really say out loud what they really see in the guy. They never have to try to defend him or their reasons for supporting him.

"> It’s been eight years since leaked audio from a conversation between Donald Trump and TV host Billy Bush made waves for the former president’s descriptions of kissing and grabbing women without their consent.

> Now, young people are encountering the tape for the first time on TikTok, where users are sharing videos of their reactions and, in some cases, reaching large audiences.

> Many first-time voters were young teens in 2016 when The Washington Post first reported the incident, in which the former president seemed to endorse sexual assault during a behind-the-scenes conversation on an “Access Hollywood” set when he didn’t realize his microphone was on. Despite widespread criticism of Trump’s comments at the time, he went on to win the 2016 presidential election, and the mainstream news cycle moved on.

> In this video from 2005, Donald Trump prepares for an appearance on ""Days of Our Lives"" with Access Hollywood host Billy Bush and actress Arianne Zucker. (Video: Obtained by The Washington Post)

> Now, the generation that came of age during the #MeToo era is turning to social media for information about candidates and elections — 39 percent of young adults say they frequently get their news from TikTok, according to Pew Research. This week, many said on the social network they were shocked by the former president’s words and confused why the episode wasn’t a dealbreaker in 2016.

> “I don’t think any of my friends had heard it,” said Kate Sullivan, a 21-year-old student in Ohio who heard the tape for the first time on her TikTok For You feed this week. “We all felt equally shocked.”

> People her age have less tolerance for sexual misconduct after growing up amid a series of high-profile harassment and assault cases involving major celebrities, Sullivan said. She immediately felt compelled to share the audio in her own video, with the superimposed text, “Fathers are voting for this man.” The video has been viewed 2.5 million times and was reshared by singer Billie Eilish to her 68 million followers.

> Brigid Quinn, a 15-year-old in Georgia, knew that Trump had been accused of making sexist comments, she said. But she had never heard the words he actually said — including the ‘grab them by the pussy’ quote. She “didn’t understand how people thought this was normal.”

> She made her own video featuring Trump’s audio in hopes her school friends of voting age would see it.

> “I’m around a lot of [18-year-olds] on my sports team, and I thought maybe I could show them who to vote for,” she said. Some people came up to her at school saying her TikTok was the first they had ever heard of the tape.

> This election season, Trump’s and Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaigns have run sprawling operations on TikTok, both posting to their own accounts and paying influencers to reach the video app’s large share of Gen Z and millennial users. Notably, TikTok is the only platform that confirmed to The Post that users can use the word “vote” in their videos without being suppressed. But neither candidate can control the narrative on the app’s algorithmic feed, where videos shoot to viral fame regardless of whether they’re tied to the current news cycle.

> The infamous tape came about a month before the 2016 presidential election and set off a crisis within the Republican Party, which was already grappling with Trump’s insurgent campaign. Trump apologized for his comments in the video but also sought to downplay them as “locker room banter.”

> A number of prominent Republicans announced they were no longer supporting Trump, and some even called on him to end his candidacy. The Republican speaker of the House at the time, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said he was “sickened” by the tape and told colleagues he would no longer defend Trump.

> Now, Trump is running for president with the backing of the Republican Party. But in the internet era, content never dies. Some social media users must carefully manage their so-called digital footprints to avoid blowback from colleges, jobs or their social circles. The same goes for public figures. In July, for example, the personal blog that vice-presidential nominee JD Vance kept during college made the rounds on X.

> News cycles on social media often take their cues from evocative posts and videos, rather than the mainstream media.

> “Thanks to social apps, things that weren’t necessarily relevant for one election cycle may come back to haunt in subsequent election cycles,” said Jeffrey Blevins, a professor of journalism and political science at University of Cincinnati.

> Some of the trending “Access Hollywood” TikToks came from older users who heard Trump’s comments the first time around. But for people like Sullivan, who will vote for the first time in Tuesday’s election, the discovery cast both the 2016 and 2024 elections in a new light.

> Did people know about the tape before they voted in 2016? she asked a Post reporter.

> Yes, the tape came out before Election Day.

> “I just recently got into politics,” she said. “The fact that people knew about this, and he still won, is pretty wild to me.”",2024_11_02,05_26_36

IIRC, the family staged a kind if intervention about it. Longtime friends emailed her directly, begging her not to run.

"I think it’s great that her voters will be able to pat themselves on the back as Trump allows Netanyahu to “finish the job” (his words) and eventually settle Gaza and annex the West Bank. 

Biden’s policy has sucked. But at least Kamala, without having an impending election coming can put more pressure on Netanyahu for a ceasefire. At least she’s mentioned a ceasefire. 

If stein had a shot to win sure vote for her, but it’s either Trump or Kamala.

But yes when Trump makes the genocide situation even worse in Gaza and strips rights from every minority group in the US at least these young (often white, from a blue state and less affected) people will be able to pat themselves on the back and say “We did it! We beat Kamala! Now Palestine is safe!”

But seriously if you vote for stein and ur in a swing state or a “leans D/R” state don’t lie to us. You don’t give a damn about Palestine or anyone else but yourself. Cause ur making the work to help Palestine objectively more difficult even if its already difficult. 

The democrats in Congress who are supporting Palestine have a stronger audience with Kamala than Trump. If you want actual work done there is one choice. 

So Take your self-aggrandizement and shove it.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"For those who aren't aware, Putin's MO in Russia is to basically run alternative power blocs as puppets, not just in the political sphere but also socially. For instance the Russian Orthodox Church has for many decades been completely coopted by first the Soviet, and then the Russian state, with the current Patriarch being directly linked to the KGB when the archives briefly opened in the 90s. 

In terms of political parties though it is widely known that both the liberal and farther right opposition to Putin's party are sponsored by his own. Besides simply murdering off legitimate attempts to form opposition, one of the tools of rigging elections is to get lackey's to legally change their names to be the same as any one in the real opposition running, so that when you go to fill out a ballot you don't know who you're actually voting for. Like there will be 3 Mikhail Lidov's running, for the peace party, the liberal peace party, and the party of liberal peace, and only one of them is real. 

Nor is Russian electoral meddling, especially in foreign countries some new thing. In the Renaissance era, the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth was Russia's main adversary in Eastern Europe, both larger and more powerful at it's height. The Tsars however repeatedly exploited the Commonwealth's unanimity requirements for voting (cough cough EU), by simply buying off a few electors who would veto any proposed legislation or decision aimed at fighting Russia, or strengthening the state. The result was that the Commonwealth tore itself apart over time, and the lands were gobbled up by the surrounding Russian, Prussian, and Austrian autocracies. Let's not let the same fate happen to our American Commonwealth.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Jill Stein is a POS.

Anyone voting for the Green Party is a moron, at best.  I say that as someone who ranks environmentalism as my top voting issue.   You are literally throwing away your vote.   You **are going** to get candidate A or candidate B as President.   A logical person would look at those two candidates and see that they have very different viewpoints on environmentalism and climate change.  They are **not** the same.

Is it simply about feeling good about yourself that you voted for the ""best"" environmental candidate (putting aside that Stein is as phony a candidate as there is.)?  Even if the Greens put forward a great candidate, it's a worthless vote, or worse, a costly one if you would otherwise have voted Democrat.  But you do you.

If you need proof, just look at how zealously and comprehensively Trump got rid of any environmental protection put in by the Kenyan guy before him.   You don't have to wonder about Trump's stance on these issues--he talks the talk and walks the walk.   As flighty as he is about sticking with anything, he's positively steadfast when it comes to rolling back environmental protections.

Always remember the rallying cry of Trump's hand-picked EPA head---""the War on Coal is Over.""",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"As a 2000 Nader voter, I have _opinions_ on this subject of third-party voting.

Let's talk president first. Let's say you just want to get your candidate/party to 5% of the vote to qualify for PECF minor-party status for funding for the next election. Cool! That's happened 14 times in US history, most recently in 1996 with Perot. **Every single one bombed** out the next election and the majority of them dissolved afterward. No third party has every leveraged the PECF into future success, because they didn't win any power and thus couldn't do anything, and thus had nothing to run on the next election.

Maybe you're aiming higher, you think you can outright win the EC as a third party (because SteinWare are actually claiming that). Third parties took 2nd place in both 1872 and 1912! It's not that big a lift, right? Those were **4-candidate splits** and the winner still had an outright majority.

I've just now typed and deleted about two paragraphs of how the FPP and EC mathematically lead to two parties and that any deviation from that is basically punished, but I realize that's appealing to the wrong level. Let's try this:

If someone thinks that the **President** is the person that has the power to effect all the progressive change that they desire, they are _morally inconsistent_ in the following way. They do not believe in fixed hierarchies. They do not believe in kings as the best method of governance. They (hopefully) recognize that unions, communities, and collectives are the best model for action, not top-down edicts. They cannot consistently reconcile that with a unitary executive. This is not their fault! There's a lot of evolutionary pressure for humans to respond to Authority in times of stress.

So why would a progressive _candidate_ be honestly targeting the executive position without a union, community, or collective backing? Why are they not building a foundation? Why is it that out of the 520,000 elected positions in the US, the Green party (ditto Libertarian) holds **180** of them? That is not a serious movement. That is a grift.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I hear people bandy about the 5% thing a lot so I did the math based on the turnout for the 2020 election. 5% of that would be 7.7 million people. There's no way on earth Stein would ever pull those kinds of numbers. I dug a little deeper and the most any Green candidate has ever pulled was a little over 1 million votes when Ralph Nader's giant ego handed the White House to Bush. I'll never forgive Nader for that because, as you mentioned, we could have started addressing the global warming crisis 24 years ago, and instead we got Captain Cowboy and the Oil Baron. Had Gore been in I think we would have avoided some of the extreme climate events we're seeing now.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"There is a lot of evidence that shows her entire goal is just to siphon votes from Kamala, and that she is being paid to do so.

"It’s really frustrating because conceptually, I’d love to support the Green Party. The ideals that they pretend to have all sound great and that’s a political party that I could happily vote for. 

But we’re never going to get ranked choice voting in the US because it would take power away from the two main parties. That’s one of the few areas where I’ll agree with “both sidesing”, because neither Republicans or Democrats want to cede power.

Basically serving as a signal booster for campaigns they actually can win.

That said our council is shit in general.  The two good things I saw her do

1. She was for keeping the head tax.  Basically Amazon through a hissy fit over some new taxes and threatened to bail on a lease in downtown's shiniest new building.  Most council members caved and voted to repeal/suspend the head tax that was directly voted into existence by the electorate, and then Amazon reneged on that lease *anyway*.  They used the threat of doing what they always intended to do to strong arm the council against the will of the city and those idiots got dumped by it.  Amazon then did the same thing on the national level with the HQ2 ""competition"".

2. She was on the protestors side during George Floyd, but like every community meeting she's ever been to, she would hog the mic and not give a voice or collaborate with the protestors on the ground setting the whole event up beyond things that directly benefitted her.

It’s the same old song. But this time, the Republican central message is getting a big signal boost: Elon Musk. 
Now, it turns out there might be some voter fraud being committed — but not in Pennsylvania and not by Democrats. On Tuesday, Indiana state police said they had arrested Larry Savage, a Republican precinct committeeman and former congressional candidate. Police say he stole two ballots from a test of voting machines and then claimed the machines were flawed.

According to court documents, the investigators also searched Savage’s phone and found a text that read: ”sis, they say anything about the ballots i took.” Investigators also say he posted on a social media page condemning the county’s election procedures, shortly before police found the stolen ballots in his truck.

Anyway the purpose of their forecast is to say how many times they think each one would win the election if it was held 100 times.

The irony is that you yourself are cherry picking and running some sort of interference on his language related to ""firing squads"".

 - Trump is running to be President, and he cannot properly articulate a very straightforward thought, like the one you did, in a way that doesn't inflame tensions? Why would anyone want such a person as the commander-in-chief? 
 - If the argument is that he can properly articulate the thought, then he's clearly doing so in a way that is fantasizing about a political opponent being in the line of fire. He did it twice. It's that simple. Who cares about the logistics of a firing squad when the image he is trying to invoke is obvious?

Did write in any offices that had no Democratic option, but did have a write in vote.

"Dude Democrats are running a better campaign by far than Trump and their enthusiasm is higher than Trump's supporters but many polls are going in his direction. Why do you think that is? Because they are intentionally flooding the site with low-quality right-wing polls. Not all polls are equal but they still count all of them in the average at 538 which is bullshit. A recent Marist poll had Harris up in the critical blue wall states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania and they are known for being a reputable polling organization. Also, I think many polling organizations are afraid of underestimating Trump again so they are overcompensating for it.

"Nate Silver's model has Trump at 55% vs 45% in the EC. Her margin in national polls is not nearly as large as Biden's was this time in 2020. Harris is not doing well enough in polling in PA for anyone to be confident about the outcome there, in particular. And if she loses PA she probably isn't winning enough of the other larger battlegrounds to compensate. 

 The early voting data encourages me, and I don't quite believe it myself, but there is plenty of data to support the idea that Trump has even or better chances. Of course, all the media benefit from this looking like a 50/50 horse race.

"The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination

This paper examines Donald Trump's character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America's most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington's humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln's moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump's conduct—both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th—reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump's character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.

"As a former L&D nurse, and still a perinatal nurse, I don’t understand why they wouldn’t treat her sepsis regardless of the disposition of her pregnancy.

The EMR even automatically generates a warning and a note, based on vital signs that usually flow in automatically from monitors, that makes you acknowledge that you were informed that the woman is in danger, before you can do anything but log off. Nurses have to input who they notified of the “SAVEMOMS” score being actionable. 

Treatment for sepsis usually doesn’t require termination of a pregnancy for most of its components. And pregnant patients can be admitted to an ICU-happens all the time, even in hospitals that have L&D units. They just send an L&D nurse up periodically for whatever they need us for, or even sit one at the bedside continuously. Sometimes with a whole delivery set up including for an emergency C/S in a nearby room.

That is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness**. It is an exercise which always involves a certain number of internal contradictions and even a few absurdities. The conspicuously wealthy turn up urging the hungry character-building value of privation for the poor. The man who has struck it rich in minerals, oil, or other bounties of nature is found explaining the debilitating effect of unearned income from the state. The corporate executive who is a superlative success as an organization man weighs in on the evils of bureaucracy. Federal aid to education is feared by those who live in suburbs that could easily forgo this danger, and by people whose children are in public schools. Socialized medicine is condemned by men emerging from Walter Reed Hospital. Social Security is viewed with alarm by those who have the comfortable cushion of an inherited income. Those who are immediately threatened by public efforts to meet their needs — whether widows, small farmers, hospitalized veterans, or the unemployed — are almost always oblivious to the danger.""*

Most of the center probably remember Bush ignored the Clinton administration dossier on Bin Laden, his terrible response on hurricane Katrina, and a generation long war built on lies. So, he’s probably not something the center cares about.

And the left doesn’t need Bush to tell them to vote for Harris.

Or for another angle, the bushes and trumps have hated each other for a long time. Even sweet grandma Barbara Bush got in on Trump bashing 10-15 years ago. as dumb as Jeb and Jrs were are still smarter than Trump and they’re old money, real money, oil money.

>And of course it's well known now that Cheney was leaning hard on the intelligence agencies to say that Iraq had WMDs even though it was internally disputed.

It was disputed but it was a reasonable interpretation of the situation, given Hussein's actions. He was even refusing to let in weapons inspectors that he'd previously agreed to allow in

>As for Afghanistan, of course 9/11 needed to be answered for, but we found Bin Landen in Pakistan.

Sure bit Afghanistan was the place that was openly harboring him and that refused to hand him over to us

>That war could have been kept to a smaller footprint without a focus on nation building

Personally I think all lives matter - even foreigners. The 20 years after the US overthrow of Taliban granted massive advances for the lives of regular people in Afghanistan, particularly for the country's 20 million women. The US nationbuilding was transformative for many lives, and the withdrawal, the horrid plan written up by Donald Trump, was an utter disaster

Isolationists like to talk about the costs of the war. But the human cost was frankly miniscule and saved far more lives than lost. And the economic cost? Well, I like to compare it to the Child Tax Credit expansion that Democrats and even folks to the left of the Dems tend to think was very good. That CTC expansion would have cost $1.5 trillion if extended the full 10 years, or in other words $150 billion a year. Roughly 5 million kids were lifted out of poverty and would remain unimpoverished today if the expansion was continued. And it *should* be continued. But if we are willing to stand for that, we should look at Afghanistan in the same way. The war cost about $2 trillion over 20 years. In other words, a cost of $100 billion a year - 1/3 less than the CTC! And Afghanistan is a country of 40 million people. The women of Afghanistan, half the country, and many men who oppose the Taliban too, we could have kept them from the horrifying long night of radical religious fundamentalist fascism that has descended on the country. We could have maintained relative freedom and safety for tens of millions of people,for the cost of just 2/3 of the beloved CTC expansion. It was frankly a huge moral failing, our refusal to do that

And choosing Iraq over the other usual suspects was pretty arbitrary and dumb. Unless of course you subscribe to cynicism about finishing daddy's war and of course there's that oil thing. 

All life's matter is well and good but a lot more of those lives would have kept on living if Afghanistan had been more about intelligence and targeted raids with SOF then boots on the ground.

"I don't know. I'm very skeptical. There's unfortunately too many bad data points. I give my breakdown and forecast here:

https://youtu.be/kFDkvrICM48?si=hg9frcpe35Fpfc4w

In the comments I also address some points about the composition of early voting and eventual electorate:

The bottom line is turnout will determine election results. The early votes indeed show women turning out by a large margin in key swing states and elsewhere. If the composition of the final electorate is more female than years past, even by a few % points, that's a scenario where Harris can win. It's too soon to tell though since we still have a long way to go, and most people haven't voted yet. In general, there's several scenarios where Harris could win.

It's possible that the polls are overcorrecting vs 2020, but I think it's unlikely; the fact that so many polls show the same downshift away from the Democratic candidate and towards Trump, including versus the 2020 actual results (ignoring 2020 polls), is an important factor.

Here are the main reasons I still think Trump will win:
- 1: Republican voter registrations have surged this time around. And I expect Republican turnout to be strong, which is why I give them a +1 advantage in composition of the electorate (compared to -1 in 2020). Democrats have just done a poor job in comparison.
- 2: Among independents/leaners, there are are still so many people in the US who think presidents magically control prices, such as for gas and groceries, and who erroneously think a Trump presidency will get them lower prices.
- 3: Say what you will about the anti-Trans stuff (personally, I think it's contrived culture war nonsense/distractions), I believe these ads are effective. Never underestimate the ability of American voters to get easily distracted into voting against their own interests.
- 4: The Gaza/Israel conflict. I think there are enough people on the left, young voters, and among the Muslim American population who will sit out, vote third party, or even defect to Trump, that it could make a difference of up to 1pt.
- 5: While you can say women have turned out strongly, young voters are turning out poorly and that needs to change fast or else Harris doesn't have a chance. In general, banking on younger voters has often been a losing proposition.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

It’s also been suggested that some trusted pollsters rely heavily or entirely on landline phone surveys, which means their contact lists are shorter and their response rates are lower.

The reason I ask that is because:

- (1) Democrats have already saturated their voter registrations in both 2020 and 2022 where they brought LOADS of people into the fold. So naturally, if you've already made considerable ground, there really aren't as many people to nab in 2, 4 years since the last two big elections.

- (2) Independents are making up a larger portion of registrations, and this is especially popular with younger generations.

- (3) We are about to see the largest crossover support from Republicans to Democrats in years with all these GOP endorsements of Harris. Registered Republican doesn't mean they're voting Trump.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I'm well aware that he might win and I'm personally preparing for it. With that in mind, I believe that PA is dems sole hope.

I kinda feel that appealing to Never Trumpers was a mistake. You could have targeted independents with a similar ad and you could have gotten a more reliable voting group. Those republicans will never vote for a democrat.  

As for the Gaza and trans issue. I don't think they're as important, not even the left. Gaza could shift Michigan but Kamala should focus on PA and perhaps WI.

The important thing to remember is that the ""odds"" in this case are odds for the polls, not for the actual election. An 80% chance of winning just means that the polling model predicts that its own error would resolve in her favor 80% of the time. However, it does not actually know what the real numbers are.

This time around, the Democrats can count on a surge in young voters, women voters, and now an October surprise bonus in Puerto Rican voters.

While the GQP can count on an increase in white males claiming they will vote for Trump (when they'll get around to it, ahem), that is unlikely to offset the drop in enthusiasm for Trump this time around (based on conviction fatigue and their general disillusionment after being bilked for scam after scam) and the fact that another large batch of his suckers will have died of old age (like they did by 2020 and with Covid).

Another estimate is that Puerto Ricans are 3.69% of the state, which has 8.9 million registered voters. If the proportions are the same, that’s about 326,000 adults.

It’s probably somewhere between those two numbers?

Edit: separately, there’s the interplay between Puerto Ricans being heavily Democratic already, with probably below average rates of political participation. So maybe a few tens of thousands of potential new votes here. Which isn’t a lot, but it doesn’t take a lot to matter.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

*****
> An ad reminding women that they can vote differently from their partners - and aren&#039;t obliged to tell them about it - appears to be touching on a very real phenomenon.

> According to a YouGov poll, 1 in 8 women voted differently from their partners in an election without telling them.

> Women have typically voted for the Democratic candidate at a higher rate than men, but polls have shown an even wider gender gap in this election cycle, with women backing Vice President Kamala Harris by as much as 12% over Trump.

So if they are both the same on that issue, then we have to look at other issues.

Will Kamala or Trump be better for your friends and loved ones? Will Kamala or Trump be closer to your personal ideals? Will Kamala or Trump very more willing to listen in the future? Which one is more likely to cause more damage geopolitically?

You can hate Kamala for not being strong against Netenyahu, but we have a choice between 2 candidates.

> For the families of the close to 100 hostages still held captive in Gaza - about half of whom are now presumed dead - our last shred of hope depends on the election of an American president who can successfully pressure both Israel and Hamas to make a deal that brings the hostages home and ends the enormous suffering caused by this war.

> President Joe Biden&#039;s administration, with Harris&#039; support, has been tireless in its efforts to secure a deal that would ensure the release of the remaining hostages - one that would involve an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza without allowing Hamas to come back to power - and I trust Harris to see it through.

> Throughout his campaign, he has expressed no plan at all for how to get the hostages released, and has only made empty threats that their captors will &quot;Pay&quot; if they are not returned.

What they do is they spend years organizing across multiple countries, get their favored representatives elected, and continue spreading their influence so much so that both parties in the US basically compete to show who is more pro-Israel. They don't protest vote, they don't abstain, they dive deeper into the political muck and do what it takes to have the power. 

Leftists should learn from that to affect change for Palestine and for other worthy causes like the environment. The US Green Party is a great other example of all flash and no substance.

It’s the same old song. But this time, the Republican central message is getting a big signal boost: Elon Musk. 
Now, it turns out there might be some voter fraud being committed — but not in Pennsylvania and not by Democrats. On Tuesday, Indiana state police said they had arrested Larry Savage, a Republican precinct committeeman and former congressional candidate. Police say he stole two ballots from a test of voting machines and then claimed the machines were flawed.

According to court documents, the investigators also searched Savage’s phone and found a text that read: ”sis, they say anything about the ballots i took.” Investigators also say he posted on a social media page condemning the county’s election procedures, shortly before police found the stolen ballots in his truck.

	•	Authoritarianism: Fascism centralizes power in a single leader or ruling party, diminishing or eliminating democratic governance and civil liberties.
	•	Nationalism: Fascist regimes promote extreme nationalism, emphasizing the superiority of their nation or ethnic group above others.
	•	Militarism: Fascism glorifies military strength and often prioritizes aggressive expansion or war to strengthen the nation.
	•	Suppression of Dissent: Fascist governments suppress opposition, often through propaganda, censorship, and violence against critics or political opponents.
	•	Corporate-State Alliance: Fascism often entails a partnership between government and large businesses to control the economy while keeping it nominally private, promoting industries that serve the state’s agenda.
	•	Anti-Individualism: The ideology promotes the idea that the individual is secondary to the collective will of the nation, often undermining personal freedoms in favor of state loyalty.
	•	Uniform Ideology and Identity: Fascism enforces a strict cultural and ideological unity, frequently persecuting minority groups or dissenting subcultures to maintain societal “purity” and order.

many of us though do.   it seems the more democrats keep spewing this insanity - the more people there are who are finally recognizing it for what it is.

...........garbage, facist, nazis, stupid, weak women, basket of deplorables, irredeemable, hitler.......

threads like this are finally accomplishing what they should have from the start - they're waking people up to what it is Americans are truly up against. 

immediately after democrats abolished democracy to install harris 'to protect democracy' she had a huge lead.

then came the insanity.  the more threads like this - the more her surrogates - bill clinton, obama, cuban, walz, lopez, biden, lizzie, etc - get out and tell people what they really think of people who dare 'oppose the party' --- the better poll numbers and early voting seem to be for Trump

so it's definitely not all of us don't want to hear this ---- quite a few of us encourage it.  

election day is only 4 days away - not sure how many threads like this you have time to start/manage, but certainly i would encourage you to enlist the help of your friends and peers.   what would help even more is if you could link the posts to videos of harris and her surrogates telling Americans how the democrat party actually and honestly views anyone and everyone who would dare to oppose them.

But the road to hell is paved with good intentions for a reason. It’s easy to excuse atrocities when you’re convinced that they’ll bring about a better world. After all, that’s the trap the anti-abortion crowd has fallen into. They’re so in love with the idea of eliminating abortion that they don’t recognize that the number of women who will die from pregnancy complications is bigger than the number of aborted *viable* pregnancies (which is to say that the fetus could actually be a live birth that would survive until at least 5). They’re romanticizing potential and refusing to acknowledge reality. 

It’s the same flaw that has cause our education system to collapse: parents love the idea that their kids will be rich and take care of them in dottage, and they see academic failure not as a result of their kids being unwilling or unable to master the material but rather on an infringement on their right to retire wealthy.

The Nazis did not start with genocide.

First, they accused Jews and immigrants of stealing jobs from Germans. They claimed Jews were killing babies and drinking their blood. Sounds similar to Republican claims that immigrants are stealing jobs, Democrats kill babies, and immigrants eat cats and dogs.

Then, the Nazis called for physical violence against their political enemies and the Jews. I recall Trump telling his supporters in 2016 to beat up protestors at his rally, and that he would pay for their legal bills if they did. He also told law enforcement to not cover the heads of people pushed into police cars so that those people would hit their heads. This past month Trump called for a day of violence where police could beat up suspects. Sounds like the Nazi Kristallnacht.

Trump ordered ICE to separate immigrant families and keep them in concentration camps. To this day, some of the children have not been reunited with their families. Sounds similar to what the Nazis did to their “undesirables.”

Hitler told Germany that only he could save the Germans from the Jews and communists. Doesn’t Trump say that only he can save America from communists?

Please enlighten me.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Yes. The dark secret about Nazi Germany that a lot of people refuse to accept is that most of the German civilians knew something really, really fucking bad was happening to their Jewish/gay/Roma neighbors— many even knowing near the end of the war that this “bad thing” was being gassed and exterminated in death camps. Most did not care, a huge percentage even agreed with it— they viewed it as “degenerates” getting what they deserved. Most who did oppose what was happening in principle lacked the conviction to do anything at all about it; they were just fine with keeping their head low and many even overcompensated by being some of the most prolific snitches/rats (in order to hopefully avoid the eye of the gestapo).

So, yes, if America descends into fascism then even most of the White “Harris 2024! Fuck Trump!” crowd  will stand by— or even assist— when their neighbors get loaded into the cattle cars.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"No, I'm not sure many of them will be very concerned.  

At least the people who lived during the Holocaust may have, at first, *somewhat reasonably* believed that their neighbors were merely being [deported](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/deportations) - as the Nazis promised -  and disappearing just meant you were either shoved into a ghetto or shipped off the the US, UK,  South America or one of those degenerate places...  

I think it'll be the same thing, after people warning them and and being ignored or called ""radicals"" and ""Communists"", they'll have shocked Pikachu face when it turns out that deporting people isn't straightforward and you can't actually do it at scale, and the camps were getting overcrowded, and well one thing led to another....""",2024_11_02,05_26_36
Tell me how he’s a fascist. What does that word even mean to you,2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Uh it says ""11 million Jews"" isn't that the number of deportations that Trump and Vance have been throwing around?

Well that's fucking terrifying.

  
noted: idk if anyone can see the other comment I posted that got removed because I used an excess number of the same letter to denote shock",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Sure I think the wikipedia article for it sums it up nicely, formatted it for readability and added brackets are my own points:

Fascism is a far-right, authoritarian, and ultranationalist political ideology and movement, characterized by:

. A dictatorial leader (one for example, who tried to overthrow the results of an election that he lost)

. Centralized autocracy (project 2025 wants to fire public servants unless they swear loyalty to Trump, and he wants to shut down several government agencies) 

. Militarism (wanted to shoot protestors as reported by his aides)

. Forcible suppression of opposition (stated multiple times that people like Pelosi and Schiff are ""the enemy within"" and should be dealt with by the military)

. Belief in a natural social hierarchy (America is for Americans, Grab them by the pussy),

. Subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation or race (outlawing abortion, wanting to outlaw no fault divorces for example, clamping down on labor unions)

Trump fits every one of these descriptions, in multiple ways. I have provided some examples of each.

I have answered your question, now answer mine. How does Trump not fit the above description? Do you actually have a point or will you just continue to nitpick semantics? What should we describe him as?",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"If Trump wins and manages to somehow deport the hundreds of thousands of legal and illegal migrants in this country, it will seriously deplete the farm and other labor workers. So where will would a Trump admin get workers to fill those missing farm jobs? My first thought is the prisons. Already in some states, prisoners are leased out to work. We wouldn't need to call them slaves. They're ""prisoners with jobs"", to quote a Marvel movie.  
   
And of course, when the prison population isn't enough to fulfill those agri job needs the solution will be to increase the prison pop.

Women always vote more than men.  The vote is typically 51-53% women.  Women vote Democratic - Clinton was +15 and Biden was +11 in the [last presidential elections](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/)

But white women as a whole give the Republicans the edge, specifically Baby Boomers and older.  Black women are the ones who vote 95%+ for Democrats.  Trump enjoyed a +7 for white women over 50.

How many Republicans are going to vote for Harris?

Only 6% of Republicans voted for Biden in 2020.  After January 6th and all of his legal trouble, will the Haley voters cross?

Historically, 6% is the low mark for Republicans voting for a Democrat. 

>6% R for Obama in 2012 

>8% R for Hillary in 2016

>6% R for Biden in 2020

His appointees told the Senate that Roe was established law and they were not planning on over-turning it. Then in 2022 they collectively said sike and over-turned it anyway.

*****
> Republicans are already laying the ground for rejecting the result of next week&#039;s US presidential election in the event Donald Trump loses, with early lawsuits baselessly alleging fraud and polls from right-leaning groups that analysts say may be exaggerating his popularity and could be used by Trump to claim only cheating prevented him from returning to the White House.

> &quot;We cannot be bamboozled by this again. It is vital to Donald Trump&#039;s effort if he tries to cheat and overturn the election results, he needs to have data showing that somehow he was winning the election.&quot;The reason we have to call this out is that Donald Trump needs to go into election day with some set of data showing him winning, so if he loses, he can say we cheated.

> Michael Steele, a former Republican national committee chairand Trump critic, told the New Republic that the GOP-commissioned polls were gamed to favour Trump.

If Harris has a resounding majority in the popular vote, but it's close in the EC then we'll see this playbook enacted, and then the Dems have some hard choices to make for sure. They will have to do something though because MAGA will be essentially stealing the Presidency with the backing of enablers they appointed to make it happen.

Unfortunately it's a sad fucking shame that when a Democrat wins we have to keep fighting to ensure we actually win what we won, but if a Republican wins they think it was guaranteed from the start and threaten to cause a problem for whoever challenges their win.

It tells me that Republicans are terrified of losing all power and so they're completely comfortable with doing nearly anything it takes to maintain some power.

""Trump plan would drive up inflation"" doesn't capture how truly destructive Trump's masters' plans are.

The Trump administration's plans would be brutally disastrous for the economy (let alone everything else):

Musk's intentional crashing of the economy and the following austerity, Trump's economically self-defeating tariffs and the trade wars they will spiral up, mass deportation devastating entire industries (and these industries are essential to our survival since, food and all), the massive social upheaval from Project 2025, and the civil war that would likely erupt if Trump turned the army on American citizens...

Trump told the rally crowd on Wednesday that his advisers had been counseling him against describing himself as a “protector” for women.
“They said, ‘Sir, I just think it’s inappropriate for you to say.’ I pay these guys a lot of money; can you believe it?” Trump said.

Now, it turns out there might be some voter fraud being committed — but not in Pennsylvania and not by Democrats. On Tuesday, Indiana state police said they had arrested Larry Savage, a Republican precinct committeeman and former congressional candidate. Police say he stole two ballots from a test of voting machines and then claimed the machines were flawed.

According to court documents, the investigators also searched Savage’s phone and found a text that read: ”sis, they say anything about the ballots i took.” Investigators also say he posted on a social media page condemning the county’s election procedures, shortly before police found the stolen ballots in his truck.

"Oct. 31, 2024, 3:06 PM EDT  
By Steve Benen  
Retired Adm. William McRaven, the former commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command, is perhaps best known to Americans as the Navy SEAL who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He has also become a highly effective Donald Trump critic, as evidenced by the retired admiral’s latest op-ed in The Wall Street Journal.  

""	The White House is the home of American leadership, where Republican leaders like Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Teddy Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush resided. While each of these leaders had his shortcomings and foibles, none of them consistently violated every principle of good leadership like Donald Trump does. Mr. Trump has no self-control. He lashes out at immigrants, religious groups and military heroes. He lies with reckless abandon. In August, in what was outlandish even by Mr. Trump’s standards, he reposted on Truth Social a picture of Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton above a crude sexual joke. Just last week he was regaling a crowd about Arnold Palmer’s anatomy. These are things a disturbed 15-year-old boy would do, not the commander in chief, not the man who holds the nuclear codes, not the leader of the free world.""  
	
McRaven’s piece didn’t explicitly endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, but the retired admiral said the Democratic nominee “won’t threaten the press, demean immigrants, mock those who have died for the country, break with our allies, or undermine the Constitution.”

He concluded that he couldn’t vote for Trump.

I’ve long been fascinated by McRaven’s gradual transition from a retired military leader, content to leave political fights to others, to someone who felt compelled by Trump’s antics to enter the political debate in earnest.

Just weeks into the Trump era, for example, the retired admiral tipped his toes in these waters, describing Trump’s condemnations of his own country’s free press as possibly “the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.”

About a year later, after the then-president said he would revoke the security clearances of some of his critics, McRaven wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post urging Trump to revoke his security clearance, too — explaining that he would consider it “an honor” to stand alongside those “who have spoken up against your presidency.”
In 2019, McRaven wrote another piece, this time for The New York Times, reflecting on the president’s willingness to break faith with American allies and American principles. He added that “the fate of our Republic” may depend upon replacing Trump as quickly as possible.

In early 2020, McRaven wrote another Washington Post op-ed, which concluded, “As Americans, we should be frightened — deeply afraid for the future of the nation. When good men and women can’t speak the truth, when facts are inconvenient, when integrity and character no longer matter, when presidential ego and self-preservation are more important than national security — then there is nothing left to stop the triumph of evil.”

Four months later, the retired Navy admiral explained, “President Trump has shown he doesn’t have the qualities necessary to be a good commander in chief.” On the anniversary of D-Day, McRaven contrasted Trump’s style with the kind of qualities from earlier wartime leaders. “As we have struggled with the COVID pandemic and horrible acts of racism and injustice, this president has shown none of those qualities,” the admiral said. “The country needs to move forward without him at the helm.”",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I worked in a multi-star command group during a portion of the trump presidency. Part of the morning CUB (commanders update brief) that the commanding general took every day included anything Trump has tweeted out the previous day/night because what he said on twitter could have major repercussions and destabilizing effects for our operations around the world. 

Generals were literally having to get intelligence assessments every day on the different ways our president had undermined our country/allies and put us at more risk.

"Yeah. I mean the Republican Party alone has been a major headache for the upper echelons of our military in recent years, as I understand it. It has become a yearly ritual for them to purposely hold up passing annual budgets to create political turmoil domestically. Something that forces the military to freeze much of its planning and spending efforts for weeks, sometimes months into their fiscal year. 

That alone is a major concern for our national security, even on just terms of the logistical challenges it causes alone. Considering the U.S. military is effectively the largest logistical organization on the planet, throwing even a small wrench into ongoing process is a huge, huge risk for us to take even once, let alone every. single. year. 

The modern GOP is no friend to the military. They aren’t even friends to the nation. They only care about their own agenda and they seem more than willing to let the strongest nation on Earth lose its prestige if it means they get to be in power. You ask me, that’s treason. Sad to think that there are large groups of people in the military itself who want to go along with this. Talk about voting against your own interest.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

> A running concern for Milley was the prospect of Trump pushing the nation into a military conflict with Iran. He saw this as a real threat, in part because of a meeting with the President in the early months of 2020, at which one of Trump’s advisers raised the prospect of taking military action to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons if Trump were to lose the election. At another meeting, at which Trump was not present, some of the President’s foreign-policy advisers again pushed military action against Iran. Milley later said that, when he asked why they were so intent on attacking Iran, Vice-President Mike Pence replied, “Because they are evil.”

Arguably this is not a healthy trait in an intelligence officer and it's more disastrous at flag rank, when there is little pushback. When there was pushback, it fed into a victim/martyr complex. His socio-religious zealotry also really ramped up and, most alarmingly, he was suddenly very cozy with Russian military intelligence.

Trump about what a snake pit the former administration* for seven years, or until four days before the presidential election. Just thought I’d put that out there. But, having said that, if Epstein had the straight dope...wowser. From The Daily Beast:

Wolff released the tape on his podcast, Fire and Fury. He says it was made in a restaurant in 2017, most probably in the SoHo branch of Ladurée, a patisserie in Manhattan. Epstein can be heard speaking over the din of diners. “His people fight each other,” Epstein tells Wolff on the recording, “and then he [Trump] poisons the well outside.”
“He will tell ten people ‘Bannon’s a scumbag’ and ‘Priebus is not doing a good job’ and ‘Kellyanne has a big mouth’—what do you think? Jamie Dimon [CEO of JPMorgan Chase] says that you’re a problem and I shouldn’t keep you. And I spoke to [financier] Carl Icahn. And Carl thinks I need a new spokesperson.” He continues: “So Kelly[anne]—even though I hired Kellyanne’s husband—Kellyanne is just too much of a wildcard. And then he tells Bannon, you know I really want to keep you but Kellyanne hates you.”
It’s like a new PBS series, The Stupid Borgias. Also from The Daily Beast:

Wolff has made other claims as well for which “wowser” is an inadequate descriptive.
The pedophile financier had about half a dozen pictures which showed Trump by the pool with multiple young women, Wolff claimed on his podcast, Fire & Fury, Thursday. They were taken in the “late ’90s” at Epstein’s Palm Beach home, where he victimized dozens of underage girls along with his procurer, Ghislaine Maxwell, Wolff said.
Wolff said of the photos, “They were with Trump at Epstein’s Palm Beach house sitting around the pool with these young girls, and the young girls are topless. “And in some of the pictures, they’re sitting in his lap. I mean, and, and then there’s one I especially remember where there’s a stain, a telltale stain and on the front of Trump’s pants, and the girls are pointing at him and laughing.” Trump separated from his second wife Marla Maples in 1997 and began dating his third wife, Melania, in 1998.
I think I speak for the entire shebeen when I say, “Ewwwww. Ick.”

Wolff’s track record is enough to warrant an substantial pile of salt and, even if you accept his explanation that he was running Epstein as a source for his previous Trump books, he is still a selfish schmuck for keeping this information from the public for as long as he did. But still...wowser.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

> Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said Friday that her office is investigating whether former President Donald Trump&#039;s violent remarks about former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney broke the law.

> In a post on his Truth Social account Friday afternoon, Trump said that Cheney &quot;Wouldn&#039;t have &#039;the guts&#039; to fight herself. It&#039;s easy for her to talk, sitting far from where the death scenes take place, but put a gun in her hand, and let her go fight, and she&#039;ll say, &#039;No thanks!&#039;&quot; In remarks to reporters later Friday, Trump defended his comments on Cheney, calling her a war hawk again and saying that &quot;She kills people&quot;.

> Earlier in the day, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that Trump was &quot;100% correct that warmongers like Liz Cheney are very quick to start wars and send other Americans to fight them, rather than go into combat themselves.""

"The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination

This paper examines Donald Trump's character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America's most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington's humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln's moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump's conduct—both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th—reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump's character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.

">Although the number of registered Democrats statewide is 109,000 higher than the number of registered Republicans, over 50,000 more GOP registered voters than Democrats had voted early, by absentee ballot or other method through Thursday, according to board data.

"If there is a positive thing about Trump, is his existence has inspired voters to vote against him.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Remember, 1/3 of the early votes are unaffiliated.

Younger voters are the most likely to register as unaffiliated. Forty-six percent of voters ages 18-34 are registered unaffiliated compared to 39% of voters ages 35-54, 29% of voters ages 55-74, and 25% of voters 75 and older. As a result, younger adults, especially those ages 18-34, comprise a larger share of unaffiliated voters than the overall electorate.

Compared to the state population overall, unaffiliated voters are more likely to identify as white (66% vs. 64%). Asian (2.3%) and Hispanic (5%) voters also are more likely amongst unaffiliated voters, in comparison to the electorate as a whole, while black voters (11%) are less common. Voters who did not report a race or ethnic identification were the most likely to register as unaffiliated (53%), followed by Asian (53%), other race (47%), Hispanic (46%), multiracial (44%), White (37%), and American Indian (36%) voters. Black voters were the least likely to register as unaffiliated (22%).

Excluding North Carolina-born voters, Northeastern-born voters are the most likely to be registered as unaffiliated and account for over 14% of all unaffiliated voters. Fifty percent of voters born in both Rhode Island and Massachusetts and 49% of New Hampshire-born voters are registered unaffiliated, followed by Vermont (47%). Aside from the Northeast, just under 14% of unaffiliated voters hail from a southern state besides North Carolina, followed by 8% from the Midwest, and 4% from the West. Over a fifth of all unaffiliated voters don’t report their place of birth (22%).

Just over 875,000 unaffiliated voters — 33% of the state’s unaffiliated voter population—were born in North Carolina. New York (149K), another country (114K), Virginia (89K), New Jersey (61K), and Florida (61K) were the next most common birthplaces outside of North Carolina.

The top 10 counties for unaffiliated voters include: Western counties of Transylvania (45%), Watauga (45%), Henderson (44%), and Buncombe (42%) Jackson (42%), and Madison (41%); Coastal counties of Camden (45%), Currituck (43%), and Dare (42%); and Wake County (42%) in the Triangle.

Another good thing he’s done ,2024_11_02,05_26_36
">Today [October 29th], President Biden will travel to the Port of Baltimore to announce a $3 billion investment from his Inflation Reduction Act to improve and electrify port infrastructure, support an estimated 40,000 good-paying and union jobs, reduce pollution, and combat the climate crisis.  The announcement includes $147 million in awards for the Maryland Port Administration, which will support over 2,000 good-paying and union jobs by enabling the purchase and installation of zero-emission port equipment, charging infrastructure, and power improvements. During the visit, President Biden will highlight how his Investing in America agenda is making an historic impact on communities and workers in Baltimore and across the country.

*$3 Billion Investment to Strengthen Port Infrastructure*

>Today, President Biden is announcing $3 billion in Environmental Protection Agency Clean Ports grants, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, to 55 selectees across 27 states and territories, including $147 million in implementation and planning grants for the Maryland Port Administration. The nation’s ports are the lynchpin of our nation’s supply chains and employ over 100,000 union workers across the United States.

>This funding will protect and create good-paying and union jobs and better working conditions by upgrading port operations and infrastructure to cleaner equipment, while ensuring cleaner air for port workers and nearby communities. The Clean Ports program will support an estimated 40,000 jobs across the economy, including over 6,500 manufacturing jobs, and is expected to increase demand for American manufactured electric cargo handling equipment at least six-fold over the life of the program.

>While a major economic driver, our nation’s ports are a major source of pollution for workers and surrounding communities. Communities living near ports and other transportation corridors are exposed to toxic pollution which can cause respiratory and cardiovascular harm, especially in children. The Clean Ports program will improve air quality at ports across the country by installing clean, zero-emission freight and ferry technologies along with associated infrastructure, eliminating more than 3 million metric tons of carbon pollution over the first ten years of implementation, equivalent to 391,220 homes’ energy use for one year. The funds announced today will support the purchase of battery-electric and hydrogen-powered human-operated and human-maintained equipment, including over 1,500 units of cargo handling equipment, 1,000 drayage trucks, 10 locomotives, and 20 vessels, as well as shore power systems for ocean-going vessels, battery-electric and hydrogen vehicle charging and fueling infrastructure, and solar power generation. The Clean Ports program advances the President’s Justice40 Initiative and aligns with the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal for a zero-emission freight sector.

*Investing in the Port of Baltimore*

>President Biden will announce the funding at the Port of Baltimore in Maryland. The Port of Baltimore is one of the busiest ports on the East Coast and is a major hub for the import and export of vehicles. More than 20,000 workers support daily Port operations, including unionized longshoreman and truckers. Each day the Port’s economic impact represents $192 million or more than $70 billion a year, representing 13% of Maryland’s gross domestic product.

>The Maryland Port Administration’s Equipment Electrification and Terminal Decarbonization project has been selected to receive over $145 million to purchase zero-emission cargo handling equipment and drayage trucks and facilitate the transition of the port to a zero-emission facility, as well as a nearly $2 million planning grant to help the port chart a path to greater emissions reductions in the future, delivering cleaner air for the port and neighboring communities. The port is a major economic engine for the region, providing thousands of jobs and contributing billions of dollars to the local economy—and this new investment will support over 2,000 jobs, including more than 350 manufacturing jobs.

*Creating Good Paying, Union Jobs in Baltimore and Across the Country*

>President Biden is the most pro-union president in history. He’s the first and only president to walk a picket line, and under his Administration, unions have secured historic labor wins. Last month, President Biden signed an Executive Order that calls on agencies to promote strong labor standards such as family-sustaining wages, workplace safety, and the free and fair choice to join a union, and encourages agencies to implement these standards through their Investing in America programs. This builds on a record of pro-worker accomplishments throughout the Biden-Harris Administration. For example:

>* Workers are filing for union representation at twice the rate they were at the start of the Biden-Harris Administration—the first Administration in five decades to have an increase in union petitions. In Maryland, union petitions increased by 55% percent. The National Labor Relations Board has met this historic moment by reducing unnecessary delays in union representation elections and by expanding remedies available to workers when their employers engage in unionbusting.
* The vast majority of Investing in America programs require grantees to pay Davis-Bacon prevailing wages for workers. The Administration also published the first update to Davis-Bacon prevailing wages in nearly 40 years, which will increase pay for one million construction workers over time.
* The Department of the Treasury finalized a rule implementing prevailing wage and apprenticeship bonus credits for certain clean energy projects funded by the President’s Inflation Reduction Act to ensure clean energy workers are paid good wages and that these projects create equitable pipelines to these good jobs.

*Building on Historic Investments in Maryland’s Infrastructure and Economy*

>Today’s announcement builds on a historic investment in the state of Maryland under the Biden-Harris Administration. To date, the Investing in America agenda has delivered over $13 billion for over 970 projects in Maryland, spurring over $3 billion in private sector investments.  
...  
Baltimore was also named an Investing in America Workforce Hub, where the Administration is bringing together industry, government, educators, non-profits and unions to help workers in Maryland access good jobs created by private and public sector investments in the state. In November 2023, Hub partners announced new efforts to train and hire local residents to support major infrastructure projects. These commitments include one from the State of Maryland to incorporate a Project Labor Agreement in the bidding process for nine projects covering $9 billion in investment and 11,000 jobs—including 7,000 construction jobs. One of these commitments includes Amtrak promising to invest at least $5 million in funding received through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to create recruitment and training programs for new jobs for Baltimore residents as part of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel Program.  
...

*The Biden-Harris Administration’s Ongoing Support for Baltimore*

>President Biden was last in Baltimore in the immediate aftermath of the tragic collapse of the Francis Scott Key bridge, which claimed the lives of six construction workers and closed ship traffic in and out of the Port of Baltimore. There, he said his Administration would move heaven and earth to reopen the Port of Baltimore as quickly as possible to support Maryland’s workers and economy. A Unified Command led by the United States Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers cleared 50,000 tons of wreckage from the channel, allowing the Port to fully reopen 78 days after the bridge collapse. The Department of Labor and Small Business Administration mobilized quickly to support workers and small businesses impacted by the port closure, including thousands of Longshoremen and Teamsters who rely on the port for their livelihood. And the Department of Transportation and the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force worked to limit supply chain disruptions, keep costs down, and ensure cargo quickly returned to the Port once it reopened. Today, port workers are back on the job, once again moving more than 100,000 tons of cargo per day.

>The President also committed to rebuilding the bridge as quickly as possible. Thanks to close collaboration with the Department of Transportation, Maryland is on the fast track to rebuild the bridge. In July, the Federal Highway Administration issued a Categorical Exclusion, allowing the project to clear a critical permitting milestone. And in August, Maryland selected a contractor to design and build the new bridge.  Immediately following the bridge collapse, President Biden called on Congress to fully fund the replacement bridge and his Administration reiterated this request in July.

>The Biden-Harris Administration also committed to holding the owners of the DALI cargo ship accountable for the disaster. Just last week, the Department of Justice announced a settlement of over $100 million with the owners of the DALI to cover federal government costs incurred in responding to the collapse. While the State of Maryland continues to pursue a separate lawsuit for damages incurred to the local economy, community, and families impacted by the collapse, the Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to working with Baltimore and the State of Maryland to ensure the city’s long-term recovery and success.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

SCOTUS ruling correctly once in a while to distract from all their other shitty rulings.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Can some SCOTUS scholars explain how this touches Moore v. Harper? I'm sure they're very closely related,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Even a broken clock?,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"In the *Harper* opinion, while they rejected the idea of the ISL theory, the Court did say the following:

>In interpreting state law in this area, state courts may not so exceed the bounds of ordinary judicial review as to unconstitutionally intrude upon the role specifically reserved to state legislatures by Article I, Section 4, of the Federal Constitution.

The GOP lawsuit argues that the PA Supreme Court's opinion does exactly that. And they're learning *hard* into a strict reading of the text of the PA law, which states:

>A provisional ballot shall not be counted if the elector's absentee ballot or mail-in ballot is timely received by a county board of elections

At issue here is that the mail-in ballot *was* received ""but could not be counted because it violated a mandatory rule, such as lack of signature, date, or secrecy envelope"".

The GOP argue that the court allowing provisional ballots to be counted is in direct contradiction with the law, which *Harper* says should not be done by the courts.

The thing is, which Alito notes, is that this case isn't about next weeks election: it's about the primary election that already occurred. It's just that this decision will ""happen"" to affect the general election.

Alito's issue seems to be more of a standing/relief one:

>The lower court’s judgment concerns just two 
votes in the long-completed Pennsylvania primary. Staying 
that judgment would not impose any binding obligation on 
any of the Pennsylvania officials who are responsible for the 
conduct of this year’s election. And because the only state 
election officials who are parties in this case are the members of the board of elections in one small county, we cannot
order other election boards to sequester affected ballots.

Even *if* the Court here were to grant the injunction, it would only apply to the primary election counting (which has completed), only apply to two votes, and would only apply to a single county. The Court wouldn't be able to order the whole state to refrain from counting these votes because the lawsuit didn't include the whole state.

The last reason is actually pretty much identical to another case not too long ago (I can't remember which one) that was tossed for the similar reason of trying to apply relief to the entire state when the lawsuit was applied to just a couple counties.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"""Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has successfully made his state the only one in the country that isn’t required to follow the Biden administration’s efforts to ensure that emergency departments don’t turn away patients like Crain.

After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, the administration issued guidance on how states with bans should follow the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The federal law requires hospitals that receive funding through Medicare — which is virtually all of them — to stabilize or transfer anyone who arrives in their emergency rooms. That goes for pregnant patients, the guidance argues, even if that means violating state law and providing an abortion.

Paxton responded by filing a lawsuit in 2022, saying the federal guidance “forces hospitals and doctors to commit crimes,” and was an “attempt to use federal law to transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic.”

Part of the battle has centered on who is eligible for abortion. The federal EMTALA guidelines apply when the health of the pregnant patient is in “serious jeopardy.” That’s a wider range of circumstances than the Texas abortion restriction, which only makes exceptions for a “risk of death” or “a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.”

The lawsuit worked its way through three layers of federal courts, and each time it was met by judges nominated by former President Donald Trump, whose court appointments were pivotal to overturning Roe v. Wade.

After U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix, a Trump appointee, quickly sided with Texas, Paxton celebrated the triumph over “left-wing bureaucrats in Washington.”

“The decision last night proves what we knew all along,” Paxton added. “The law is on our side.”

This year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the order in a ruling authored by Kurt D. Engelhardt, another judge nominated by Trump.

The Biden administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, urging the justices to make it clear that some emergency abortions are allowed.

Even amid news of preventable deaths related to abortion bans, the Supreme Court declined to do so last month.

Paxton called this “a major victory” for the state’s abortion ban.

He has also made clear that he will bring charges against physicians for performing abortions if he decides that the cases don’t fall within Texas’ narrow medical exceptions.

Last year, he sent a letter threatening to prosecute a doctor who had received court approval to provide an emergency abortion for a Dallas woman. He insisted that the doctor and her patient had not proven how, precisely, the patient’s condition threatened her life.""",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"*19-29* points in the early vote polls? Christ that is utterly devasting for him. That puts Harris landslide territory if it holds.

Of course, there's reason to believe the early voters favor Harris. But the Republicans keep saying they've made gains in early voting. So why aren't those gains reflecting in the early voter polls? Are a majority of the early voters just voting for Harris regardless of party affiliation?

I'm not gonna say Harris has this in the bag - obviously we need to wait for results before popping any champagne. But the way I see it now, the only way for him to win is if two things happens:

1. Record day-of turnout
1. Day-of turnout *extremely* lopsided in his favor

If only one of those happens, I don't think it will be enough for him to win.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Trumps financial policies are projected to bankrupt Social Security in 6 years or less.

As president, Trump fought to repeal and undo the ACA using executive action, legislation and lawsuits.

"A lot of what happened during the Trump Assministration has fallen into the memory hole, but this was one of their first major failures.

Republicans had campaigned for the better part of a decade on how the ACA was socialist and awful and needed to be taken down.

Of course, people don't like being given something and then having it be taken away. Republicans found this out in 2018 when even their constituents didn't want the ACA to go away entirely (they like provisions like coverage for people with preexisting conditions and being able to keep their kids on their insurance longer).

Trump in his lizard brain way saw this and promised that they wouldn't lose anything but that he would replace it with something that would magically improve services but decrease premiums.

It became clear, however, that he had no plan to do more for less and didn't even understand how the health care system worked (""who know health care could be so complicated""). Furthermore, he had zero ability to coordinate with House and Senate Republicans on this.

He wouldn't help or direct the work that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell were doing, but he would complain about it.

Here we are two election cycles later and all Trump has come up with is ""the concept of a plan"" for healthcare.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Republicans going home to their districts found constituents who didn't want things from the ACA yanked like coverage for people with preexisting conditions or the bigger age cap for children to be on their parents' insurance.

But only the imminent threat of those things being removed and not replaced or improved really motivated Republican voters to object.

"The weird part to me is why would ANY patient be discharged when there is suspected sepsis. All ERs have sepsis protocols.

Savita Halappanavar[3][4] (née Savita Andanappa Yalagi; 9 September 1981 – 28 October 2012) was a dentist[1] of Indian origin, living in Ireland, who died from sepsis after her request for an abortion after a prolonged miscarriage was denied on legal grounds.[5] In the wake of a nationwide outcry over her death, Irish voters passed in a landslide the Thirty-Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, which repealed the Eighth Amendment and empowered the Oireachtas parliament to make abortion legal. It did so through the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act of 20 December 2018.[3][6][7]

Now Abbot will claim the law would have allowed her treatment blah blah.  He's lying.  The law is written so vaguely that the doctors fear to treat.  It was done this way on purpose.,2024_11_02,05_26_36

"The message is simple. Womans health is to be controlled by the courts and if they die because of it, the GOP doesn't care. 

In fact, the GOP is in the process of writing up legislation to do even more damage, the next step of course is to make birth control illegal. 

If you are a Woman, and you are thinking about voting for the GOP, please consider the fact that you could actually die like this teenager because the GOP made it illegal for doctors to provide you needed medical care.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

That comment is based on blatant ignorance of pregnancy and women's health.  Nevaeh Crain's body would not miscarry the baby.  Hence, the medical crisis which doctors should have treated upon her first visit to an ER.

Furthermore, Republicans' nonsensical, abortion politics is why those doctors did not provide treatment to Nevaeh Crain like they would have before Roe V. Wade was overturned.  That treatment would have included removing the dying fetus.

Republicans are solely to blame for the deaths that have resulted from their bullshit, abortion politics.  Clearly, Republicans are also freaking ignorant about women's reproductive health which includes the fact that our bodies do not always magically miscarry an unviable fetus.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"You’re such a moron that it would be difficult to explain anything to you even with 64 crayons. In cases like that, doctors shouldn’t have to worry about FUCKING GOVERNMENT coming after them for doing life saving procedures when everything about healthcare is to be on the safe side so in this case just terminate the pregnancy and move to saving the mother. NO, fucking government, will come after you and say you killed a fetus too early! Like germs and unexpected complications have a fucking schedule and procurators can pull out the book from their ass and point to that schedule. Not to mention a woman has a right to deny her body, organs and health to a fetus if she wishes so. It’s not government business to defend a fetus by taking rights from a whole person and giving them to it. You’re all bunch of psychopaths with twisted morals which is super ironic giving the real sources of abortion bans.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"> These lefties just want the doctors to immediately kill the child on the first visit. 

So you never wanted to discuss this honestly, got it.

Doctors in all of these Gilead states are telling us again and again and again that they refuse to treat pregnant women because they are afraid to go to jail if they do.

It’s time for people like you to just start saying out loud that you want all these women to die for your politics.

Or at least that you couldn’t care less if they do",2024_11_02,05_26_36

">Not to mention a woman has a right to deny her body, organs and health to a fetus if she wishes so.

Nah. The unborn child has rights after so many months--human rights. Hence, the government has to intervene. Otherwise, you'd have a bunch of women committing murder without medical emergencies because of frivolous reasons under the guise of pro-choice.

  
They just need to tweak the laws so it very clear that the pregnant female be protected at all cost under these sort of medical emergencies. But again, it seems to me this was more the case of doctor negligence not even considering this an emergency to begin with.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
No worries. I originally misread it as 2024 and was surprised that her medical records were already prepared and reviewed.,2024_11_02,05_26_36

Poor Elon strayed way too far out of his lane. Imagine the sheer hubris of thinking that you’re the master at everything just because you have money.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"EXCLUSIVE: Elon Musk’s America PAC and several other defendants, including the reelection campaign for Representative Michelle Steel are accused of violating California labor law in a class action lawsuit filed in Orange County on October 30. 

These allegations are different from those WIRED reported earlier this week, when canvassers in Michigan said they were tricked and threatened as part of Elon Musk and America PAC’s get-out-the-vote effort for Donald Trump. The door knockers, who worked for a subcontractor of America PAC, were flown to Michigan, driven in the back of a U-Haul, and told they would have to pay hotel bills unless they met unrealistic quotas. One was surprised to find, upon arrival in Michigan, that they were working to elect Donald Trump.

The Blair Group, a North Carolina firm that the complaint claims is a political consultancy, and Liberty Staffing Services, a Florida firm specializing in hiring and payroll for canvassers and other W2 employees of political campaigns, are the other named defendants. Neither immediately responded to requests for comment. The suit also lists unknown Johns Doe as defendants.
