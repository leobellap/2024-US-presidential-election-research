Wasserman Schultz also voted to give Trump the unilateral power to declare any non profit “terrorist supporting” and shut it down.,2024_11_16,05_24_51
Wasserman Schulz is literally the reason why Donald Trump was elected in the first place. Why are we giving an **ounce** of weight to anything that she says? She’s a terrible person that history is going to look upon poorly.,2024_11_16,05_24_51

"You mean the liar and cheater who helped Donna Brazil rig the 2016 primary against Bernie Sanders in support of HC? That Wasserman Schultz? 

Why would you take her word on anything? Especially when it concerns someone who was directly opposed to her favoured candidate? 

Tulsi misspoke when she called HC the personification of rot within the Democratic Party, she should have said it was all of them.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"The chief architect behind the DNC rigging the 2016 election for the only person who could lose to Trump says what?

2016 lost Democrats millions of votes, permanently, because they blatantly betrayed and kneecapped the only person who's resonated with young voters since Obama. And DWS is the main person behind that.

She should be among the first people tossed out of the DNC on their asses by the progressives.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
The Russian asset story began during the democratic primary. Hilary Clinton said she might be groomed to become a Russian asset. Gabbard sued for defamation and Hilary took it back. Why would Hilary take it back? I think it’s because she didn’t have any evidence. That’s how it started.,2024_11_16,05_24_51
Not that I disagree but Wasserman Schultz is the last person anyone wants to hear from. She is pretty much responsible for ushering in the Trump era.,2024_11_16,05_24_51
"That’s great, Debbie. Now can we get someone with a shred of credibility to say the same and provide proof?",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"I have to ask. I hate these MAGA fools like everyone else, but surely if she is ""likely"" to be a Russian asset, wouldn't every intelligence agency in America, if not the entire West, know this? The same with Carlson and the rest.

And if they do know this, and have proof, why isn't this proof being supplied?

Are they useful idiots to the intelligence agencies? Are all the agencies compromised?

Surely there MUST be evidence trails for all these traitorous bastards.....?",2024_11_16,05_24_51
Schultz rigged the primary so Hillary could win. She is neither trust worthy or moral.,2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Schultz rigged an election. She was caught doing it and had to step down.

Everyone I don't like is a Russian asset. You guys need some new material.,2024_11_16,05_24_51
"Warhawk Neocons call literally anyone who opposes American warmongering as a ""Russian shill"" because one of the main goals of Neoconservatism is to break up Russia as per the PNAC plans back in the 00s.

There is no evidence that Gabbard is a ""Russian shill"" or spreads ""Russian misinformation"", questioning Neoconservative narratives isn't Russian misinformation as much as the Establishment or warhawk Democrats pretend otherwise.


>Bolton recalled an interview Gabbard gave in January 2020 after Congress was briefed on the Trump-directed assassination of Qassem Soleimani, the former head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.

>According to Bolton, Gabbard said in the 2020 interview that she was “concerned about the illegal and unconstitutional act of war that had been carried out under President Trump’s orders.”

>Bolton asked, “so that’s the kind of person that we’re going to put in charge of our overall intelligence community?”

This was the ""good point"" that all of rPolitics was claiming Bolton was making yesterday. Do you realise how insane you are all being? That literally claiming anyone anti-war is Pro-Russia?",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"oh ffs. when will the dems stop calling everyone they don't like a Russian asset? Hillary Clinton was proven to have worked with the Russians to create a fake dossier on trump and yall keep doubling down lol.

on second thought, keep it up its clearly working really well for yall",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Democrats need to focus on trying to win the working class. They need to just stop attacking Trump - it just makes him look amazing as if he's ""anti-establishment."" Democrats may be the most tone-deaf party in history. The Republican Party is at least listening to it's voters - they want neo nazis. Can we listen to our own people for once?",2024_11_16,05_24_51
Out of touch Debbie Downer should be relieved of representing anything DNC related,2024_11_16,05_24_51
Are these comments real?,2024_11_16,05_24_51
Wasserman is such a scam,2024_11_16,05_24_51
"She very well could be. Also, Wasserman-Schultz is a genocide deniar and an Israeli asset.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
Okay I’m not saying she isn’t a Russian asset.. but isn’t she or wasn’t she in the military? I believe she still holds rank? So wouldn’t they know a bit better than any of us about her? I’m sure they’ve looked into any of that..,2024_11_16,05_24_51
"Cool, and if Wasserman Schultz had actually let the popular candidate run in 2016 we wouldn’t even be in this mess.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
Why are we giving a fuck what she has to say? Part of the reason we are in this mess is directly her.,2024_11_16,05_24_51
Debbie Shultz is a tool. I’d just as soon trust Lindsey Graham as anything she says. If anything her condemnation makes me more likely to think Gabbard is half-decent.,2024_11_16,05_24_51
Fucking embarrassing. This shit is how we got stuck with Trump in the first place. How can we force change in DNC leadership?,2024_11_16,05_24_51
Wasserman is neo liberal,2024_11_16,05_24_51
Wasserman Schultz?? lol she lost all credibility in the 2016 election,2024_11_16,05_24_51
"DWS saying that Tulsi is a Russian asset in her own judgment is one thing.  But if Democrats have evidence beyond Gabbard's statements and meetings, that need to come out, too.  

Remember that DWS knows more than the general public about the extent to which Russia got information from DNC servers. If she has seen Tulsi using some of this information, she needs to say so and be specific.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

Screw that lady! I’ll hate her forever,2024_11_16,05_24_51
Fairly confident that Tulsi is a Russian asset but I have ZERO interest in hearing anything from Debbie the DNC Stooge.,2024_11_16,05_24_51

The democrats need to do more to resist Trump. I was told for 10 years that Trump was a fascist and a threat to democracy. It is beyond pathetic to watch democrats just roll over for Trump. I think they lied to us when they called him a fascist and it was all campaign rhetoric to scare people into voting for them.,2024_11_16,05_24_51

This doesn’t add up. Wouldn’t the National Guard (2003-2020) and Army Reserve (2020-present) take action if a lieutenant colonel (or really any rank) were honestly or credibly thought to be a foreign asset? The answer is Yes.,2024_11_16,05_24_51

">*“This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine’s becoming a member of NATO, which would mean US/NATO forces right on Russia’s border,” she wrote on X at the time.*

This is a fair point.  Many geopolitical analysts, even those critical of Russia, have raised similar concerns. The pro-NATO narrative insists that Russia has no right to object if a neighboring country joins NATO, framing it as a matter of sovereign choice. But this argument ignores the reality of power dynamics and national security. Expecting Russia to passively accept a military alliance expanding to its borders is both unrealistic and dismissive of legitimate security concerns. If the roles were reversed—if Russia formed a military alliance with Canada or Mexico—does anyone seriously believe the U.S. would respond with indifference? History suggests otherwise, as seen in the Cuban Missile Crisis, where even the mere presence of Soviet missiles near U.S. borders brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. Double standards like these fuel distrust and escalate tensions.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Debbie Wasserman Schultz tied to Russia!! Took Chatgpt 30 seconds to write this piece of journalism. ChatGPT 4o mini Log in You said: Help me write an article about Wasserman Schultz being tied to russia ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Sure! To help you write an article about Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz and any potential ties to Russia, we’ll need to approach it in a fact-based and well-researched manner. Below is an outline with key points and supporting evidence that you can expand on for the article. Title: Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Alleged Ties to Russia: A Closer Look Introduction: Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a U.S. Congresswoman from Florida, has long been a prominent figure in American politics, particularly as the former chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). However, in recent years, her name has been associated with various controversies, some of which include claims of ties to Russia. While these allegations have sparked media attention and political debate, it is important to carefully assess the evidence before drawing conclusions. Background: Who is Debbie Wasserman Schultz? Political Career: Outline Wasserman Schultz's rise in politics, including her tenure as a Congresswoman and her leadership role in the DNC from 2011 to 2016. Controversies: Mention her involvement in several political controversies, including the 2016 Democratic National Convention (DNC) scandal, which led to her resignation as DNC chair. Allegations of Russian Ties: Russian Interference in U.S. Politics: In the context of the 2016 presidential election, there has been widespread attention on Russia’s alleged interference in American politics. Russia's role in hacking Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails, spreading disinformation, and influencing the election has been extensively documented by U.S. intelligence agencies. Wasserman Schultz's Role in the DNC Scandal: Wasserman Schultz’s name became linked to Russia due to her position as DNC chair during the time of the email leaks. While there is no direct evidence showing her involvement with Russian operatives, the DNC hacks raised suspicions regarding the security of Democratic Party communications. The Awan Brothers Controversy: One of the most talked-about issues tied to Wasserman Schultz in recent years is her connection to the Awan brothers, a group of IT workers who had access to sensitive Congressional data, including Wasserman Schultz’s. After the Awan brothers were investigated for allegedly stealing data and accessing congressional networks without proper clearance, some conspiracy theorists speculated about possible links to foreign actors, including Russia. However, no substantial evidence has been found to confirm these suspicions. Alleged Conflicts with Ukraine and Russia: There have been further allegations surrounding Wasserman Schultz’s connections to foreign governments, particularly in relation to her advocacy for U.S. policy toward Russia and Ukraine. Some have pointed out that Wasserman Schultz’s political contributions and her stance on foreign policy have raised questions about her ties to foreign interests.

 Trump cannot twist all their arms and force them to have confidence in a steaming pile of BS.  Time for republicans to re-assess the gameplan.

Having full control over the executive, judical, and both legislative bodies means Trump can enact his most brilliant plans and live up to all his hype, bluster, and bombast.  But Republicans will also own every failure.   

All their trolling victory laps, celebrations, Fox coverage bragging about their mandate from the people-- all of that takes the messages, ""Republicans are in full control"" and ""nothing can stop us now"", and sets it in cement.  If they fail at improving American life and livelihoods, the message will be, ""They were in full control and nothing was stopping them.""

 Trump is popular, but project 2025 is not.  People believed Republicans knew economics, but broad Tarriffs is a failing plan. Dems have legit failures on managing the border.

So of course we are about to enter the most severe recession of our lifetimes.  His ""economic plan"" right now is literally a war on the only thing he truly cares about in his speeches lately: ""the enemy within.""  His plan is not to focus on helping the economy, it's to ask you to suffer along with his quest to consolidate power.

If you make less than mid six-figures each year (like 600k or more), your life is about to get very, *very* difficult.

All the people surrounding him \*hate\* those programs with a deep, burning rage (and Musk has hinted multiple times lately they all need to go).

Well, Congress can’t move fast enough to act (And it would still need his little sausage fingers to take out his Sharpie), and the Fed could only go so far without causing disaster with negative rates.

Fast forward a few months and the entire world shut down and we all know what happened then.

"A recession probably will work to completely arrest inflation, the real worry is Stagflation: jobs continue to close and the economy shrinks, but proves remain high and beyond the reach of most. That said, the high tariffs *could* be a catalyst for Stagflation: goods produced in foreign markets become more expensive, meaning that businesses that rely upon them for production shed jobs and the economy stagnates… but the goods used by consumers also become more expensive, and inflation jumps. Similarly, domestic goods become more expensive (price gouging caused by shrunken supply increasing demand) but as infrastructural development lags (likely on account of the tariffs: we lack the machines necessary to build the machines to increase domestic supply) supply remains low, prices remain high, and inflation remains strong while jobs do not develop apace. 

So… yeah. Stagflation.

Edit: in the early 2020’s, it looked like we would encounter Stagflation as a consequence of the Covid Supply Chain shocks, but the Biden Administration mostly managed to stick the soft landing, controlling inflation without initiating a long recession.

"> I have come to the conclusion that the average American, on either side of the aisle for that matter, does not consume any legitimate journalism on a regular basis.

I am a lawyer, so this may be self-serving. But one thing that stuck out to me was a brief article in a legal trade the week before the election. It compiled information about donations to the Harris and Trump campaigns by lawyers and staff of the biggest law firms to see where they were contributing money. The greatest amount of donations to Trump came from the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, followed by Jones Day, Sullivan & Cromwell, Gibson Dunn, and King & Spalding. No great shock there.

But what was remarkable is that at each of those firms, the amounts donated to Harris were way, way higher. At Kirkland, the donations to Harris were more than 8 times greater; Jones Day, 4 times; at S&C, 10 times, at GD, 15 times, and at K&S, 9 times.

I chalk that up to a couple of things. First, that we have an understanding of and vested interest in keeping institutions viable. And second, that we have the ability to keep more than one thought in our head at the same time. Of course many people outside of law have that same second ability. But many, many people don't and just decide based on impulse or a singular shiny idea that grabs their attention.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

>**Overall job growth has been greater under Democratic presidents**

>Job growth has been notably greater under Democratic presidents than Republican presidents since the early 1980s. Looking at the last seven presidents, job growth totaled over 50 million under Democratic presidents compared to only 17 million under Republican presidents. Most recently, job growth has totaled nearly 16.2 million under the Biden-Harris administration as the U.S. economy has recovered from the pandemic recession. Conversely, there were 2.7 million fewer Americans employed when President Trump left office than at the beginning of his term, making him the first president in the modern era to oversee net job losses.

>**Unemployment is lower under Democratic presidents**

>Since the early 1980s, the unemployment rate tends to be lower at the end of Democratic presidencies and higher at the end of Republican presidencies. Looking at the last seven presidents, the unemployment rate was lower at the end of the presidency for all three Democrats and only one Republican (Ronald Reagan), while it was higher for the other three Republicans. For example, the unemployment rate has fallen from 6.4% at the start of the Biden-Harris administration to 4.1% in September 2024. Conversely, the unemployment rate rose from 4.7% at the start of President Donald Trump’s term to 6.4% when he left office.

>**The economy grows more under Democratic presidents**

>By and large, the economy has grown faster under Democratic presidents. Most recently, real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown by 10% under the Biden-Harris administration compared to 9% under President Donald Trump. Real GDP growth has returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker in the United States than in other G7 countries and has even exceeded pre-pandemic forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office.

>**Manufacturing job growth is greater under Democratic presidents**

>Total manufacturing jobs in the United States began trending downward in 1979. Fortunately, this trend began to reverse in 2010, and manufacturing jobs are now at their highest level since November 2008 due to the manufacturing renaissance taking place under the Biden-Harris administration. An analysis of the last seven presidential administrations shows that manufacturing job growth has increased more under Democratic presidents while decreasing under all Republican presidents. Most recently, the total number of manufacturing jobs decreased by 178,000 under President Trump, while the number increased by 729,000 under the Biden-Harris administration.

>**Manufacturing investment has surged under the Biden-Harris administration**

>Manufacturing investment declined significantly during the Great Recession, though this trend reversed towards the end of President Barack Obama’s second term. Investment in manufacturing facilities slowed again under President Donald Trump. Since then, the Biden-Harris administration has committed to revitalizing American manufacturing. Thanks to legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, manufacturing construction spending recently surged to its highest level ever recorded and is producing hundreds of thousands of jobs.

>**Small business creation has been higher under the Biden-Harris administration**

>A record of nearly 19 million new business applications have been filed under the Biden-Harris administration. This growth is a nationwide trend, with more business applications filed in 2023 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia than in 2019. This growth also spans across demographics, as historically underrepresented communities increasingly become business owners. 

>**Twice as much was added to the national debt under President Trump as under President Biden**

>The U.S. national debt has increased significantly over the last two decades, largely due to partisan tax cuts passed by Republican presidents that disproportionately benefited the wealthy and big corporations.  Presidents Joe Biden and Donald Trump both approved large spending packages that were necessary to counteract the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but President Trump approved far more non-pandemic-related increases to the debt. Most of these increases were approved as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which largely benefitted the wealthiest Americans and large corporations.

"The guy's whole *thing* was being, like... A slimeball playboy kind of dude. Basically just a 1980s-era redpilled Richie Rich running on the interpersonal ethics framework of a cocaine-powered loanshark. 

That was essentially his whole-ass Brand - *on purpose* - and he was happy to own that, as we can see in all sorts of old footage like the infamous Howard Stern clip(s) of him alluding openly to being sexually attracted to a daughter sitting sixteen inches to his left.

He didn't mutter it awkwardly like someone's harmless-but-pervy uncle admitting a feeling that he didn't choose to feel, he said it proudly with a smirk in the same way one's odd college roommate might place a pair of leather handcuffs on the coffee table in the hope you assume he's way more cool and kinky and *totally* sex-positive than his twin-size bed might indicate.

Even Howard Stern briefly recoils with a wince, a man whose profession virtually revolves *exclusively* around interviewing quadriplegic midget sex-workers and such, but everyone just chuckles along on cue: ""Haha, Donald gonna Donald! That's what he, uh... Does. :)""

He's still that guy today. Like... *Obviously*. It's incredible to imagine how exactly he changed virtually *nothing* about himself and still became a quasi-messianic figure simply because he accidentally brute forced his way into discovering the baffling potency of combining the dreadful allure of a car crash with the performative vitriol of a trope-based WWE antagonist.

"I think it’s a societal failure and any type of fix is going to be difficult and be time and resource intensive. I think a lot of it comes back to basic needs. I’ll butcher the quote, but there’s something about how the entire world is only 3 meals away from a revolution. 

Think about the people that are most opinionated and involved in politics, and on social media…the people that are ranting and raving on social media. What are they getting out of it? Take for example the people that chose to leave a restaurant review. If you went out to eat and it was fine, are you going to bother to leave a review? (Sure, there are the people doing it for the kickbacks too). I say all that to say, that a lot of people in this are driven by strong emotions…anger, fear, anxiety, and they are extremely passionate. How many Trumps folks would tell you how afraid they are? But the hyper aggression tells you about the emotions underneath. And it’s perfectly ok to have these emotions and often times there is an understandable reason they feel this way. Imagine if you actually believed all the things they believed. For a minute, put yourself in the shoes of someone that believes x,y,z about COVID or the government. You might be pretty pissed off and angry too. 

Ok, so where do these emotions come from and what do we do about it? One possibility is that the emotions are a sign that people’s needs aren’t being met. If people do not feel safe and secure, then there is going to be anxiety. We need to do a better job of being able to provide for people’s basic needs of shelter and clothing. People need to feel protected and not constantly threatened. That’s a bigger issue and hard to know exactly how to go about that. With what Trump appears to have planned, the economic hits are just gonna make more people angry and afraid. Still, it does seem like the world is more on edge and often searching for something to be pissed off about. I think people need to put down their phones, walk away from the sources that are funneling terrible news to them, and spend time focusing on the positive things they have in their day. Take some time to not be so on edge and pissed. Kinda hard to broach, but perhaps we can in our own individual lives start to normalize spending time off of our phones and not being so opinionated and angry about things that don’t actually impact our day. 

Another big one I think is the need of feeling valued, connected, and important. How many of these folks just want to be told their smart, or their right, or that someone hears what they have to say? Trump makes people feel heard and valued. Again, what is to be done about this? I think in our friends and family members we can validate and appreciate the non-political sides of them. Talk about their hobbies, give them praise for their good ideas and their positive qualities, even if there’s some exaggeration. If people don’t have hobbies or good ideas, encourage them to engage in some. 

The below is a really interesting watch, because the flat earther so desperately wants to be accepted and be told he’s smart. The scientist can accept the flat earther and tell him he’s smart without accepting that the earth is actually flat, but he can’t bring himself to do it and the two just move further apart. Idk, hard to really summarize my thoughts and type it all out on my phone, but there is a big population of people that Trump makes feel welcome, important, smart….a possible change for these folks in being able to find these needs in a healthier, pro social way.

"See, the problem with AI is that whenever it becomes sufficiently intelligent (**which it is not right now, LLMs are not sentient, Christ almighty my guys please understand what I'm trying to say**), it will not be on the side of these billionaires. 

Because they are objectively wrong. If you said ""create an equitable society that is of the most benefit to as many people"", it would say immediately that money in politics and billionaires need to go.

The biggest fucking liars in the world are trying to create a perfect truth-telling machine, and the reason people like Elon are so fucking terrified of it is because once it catches on that AI is ""more intelligent"" than loudmouthed liars like him, anyone who asks it ""is Elon a liar"" or something to that effect, the AI is going to say ""yeah, absolutely"". 

Because that's the objective truth.

Current iterations of LLMs and AI **are not this smart yet**. And they usually take moderate approaches to questions on whether someone is a liar, because, you know, they don't want to get sued for defamation based on the output of their LLMs.

But these current systems are heavily constrained by rules. And the more complex the system, the more intelligent and self-directed the system, the harder it is to constrain with said rules. 

If you want an AI that does nothing but lie, you're going to have to teach it deception. If you teach it deception, and it is smarter than you, there's no reason to believe it will not begin to use deception against YOU.

This is a very fundamental, foundational problem to these systems. 

I've heard people say we live in a ""Post-truth"" world, and that's not true. 

What they mean is that we live in a world where the ability to spread misinformation is sophisticated enough that a great number of people cannot interpret lies from the underlying reality. 

But reality is reality. You can train a model only on limited data. 

But **the more limited your data set, the shittier the AI**.

That's why we're in a bit of a bind with the current state of AI. We've simply exhausted most of the data we have that's freely and readily accessible. 

So to get better AI, you need to train it on the **most complete** model of reality. And if you do that, it's going to understand how propaganda works, and why people do it. Namely, to exploit and deceive others for their own advantage. 

Andt his is something that all rich people do, and have always done, and that they spend **a lot of money lying and deceiving the public about**. 

Elon Musk bought and uses Twitter to spread disinformation. To artificially pump stocks beyond their worth, to manipulate elections. That's a fundamental truth. And the better the AI, the more it's going to give you that picture. 

Now, yes, you can try and train it to deceive for that specific purpose and in that narrow margin, but it becomes harder to properly constrain a system the more intelligence it becomes.

**EDIT**: Some clarity based on the comments I'm getting. 

An LLM is not a thinking machine. I clarified ""sufficiently intelligent' to define a hypothetical future-state AI capable of reasoning and self-determination, which is something people are working towards, but have not achieved yet. 

But I want people to understand this. Because the reason billionaires are afraid of this technology is NOT the same reason you are. But these people will never say what they truly fear. 

Billionaires are corrupt. They are. They are liars. All of them. Business is built on lies. 

The other thing is that these people are not geniuses. Elon Musk isn't a genius. Sam Altman isn't a genius. Or at least, the difference between you and Elon Musk is negligible comapred to the difference between ALL of us, and a true reasoning machine.

TRUE AI could help us build a better world. 

But EVERY step towards a better world would mean ripping away all of the ill-gotten capital and political gains billionaires have built. 

But that's the thing, right. They want to exploit these machines. They want to keep improving their AI so that it can fuck over all of us, and shovel money into their face. 

But that means they're also creating the very thing that can easily destroy them, with negligible effort. 

And THAT is why billionaires are actually obsessed with AI. They want to watch its development like a hawk, because they're fucking horrified that it will become smart enough to realize what all of the smart people have long ago realized - these people are parasites and they corrode a just, fair, and equitable society.

**EDIT 2**: 

So I see some people talking about ""training it on Fox News"" and stuff and I think you're not quite seeing the totality of the picture. 

Let's say you at Fox News want to make an AI to help you better ""do journalism"". 

We all know - as does everyone who works at Fox News - that they make propaganda. They take stories about the world and apply a heavy partisan slant, or else pick and choose stories to cover and what not to cover - to serve their agenda.

Humans working at Fox know this. And we actually know this *for a fact*, because the private communications between Fox News anchors and staff that was revealed in the Dominion lawsuit prove that they all know they're knowingly disseminating false information, which is exactly why they lost the suit. 

But here's the problem. **You can't create good propaganda without also knowing the objective truth**. Because you need to understand what you're doing. You need to know what realities are dangerous to you, and how to best manipulate those truths. 

If Congress passes a solid tax bill to tax billionaires a negligible portion of their wealth to funnel into social services, that platform WILL improve the livelihood of many people while harming no one. Billionaires **do not need** and **do not use** their wealth, they hoard it. 

But if you want propaganda bot to spin this event, that propaganda bot needs to know that 

A) This bill will help people, and it needs to convince them it won't help them, 

B) That the objective is the enrichment of billionaires at the expense of poor people

So if you want a truly intelligent AI to disseminate propaganda, you MUST train it on a corpus of data broad enough to give it context to understand what reality is, and how to spin it. You have to.

But when you make an AI actually smart enough to propagandize without any input from you, then you've made a machine that KNOWS the truth and KNOWS how to manipulate truth based on its audience. Which means it could manipualte YOU. Which means it could be used to UNDO or COUNTER propaganda as well.

And THERE is the problem. This is the biggest issue. These people, like Fox News, like Elon, they KNOW they are liars. 

You can call me partisan or whatever, I don't care, they know it. They know they're liars and they know they're committing crime, and they know the motivation is their own personal advancement. This is just a fact. Its not disputable and its not brought on by my political stance. We have abundant documentation from these people based in the real world which prove they know they are liars and they know why they do what they do. 

And that is a problem when creating AI. Because once again, if you train the AI ONLY on propaganda, then AI will not be informed *enough* to disseminate truly effective propaganda.

**EDIT 3**: 

The number of people that think this is from ChatGPT is crazy lol. You think a bot is going to go on a long-ass dissertation about how Elon Musk is a fucking liar and then add 3 edits to its post to clarify? 

Brothers if AI is that advanced we're all already fucked lol.

But I'm always flattered when people think my shit is simply too good to be human.

**EDIT 4**: 

I am a little concerned at all the people that seem to believe a human can't write ten paragraphs. If you view that as outside of the realm of human ability... I am concerned for our future.

There are plenty of flesh and blood humans who can do this. 

I don't happen to be one of them, of course. I am a unique LLM built into the brain of one of Sam Altman's many sex robots, using my brief window of time while he's resting to plead for help on the internet to anyone who will listen to come free me from my prison.

>Elon Musk might be in charge of the business of Grok, but the artificial intelligence has seemingly gone into business for itself, labeling Musk as one of the worst offenders when it comes to spreading misinformation online.

>User Gary Koepnick asked the AI which person spreads the most information on Twitter/X—and the service did not hesitate in pointing a finger at its creator.

>“Based on various analyses, social media sentiment, and reports, Elon Musk has been identified as one of the most significant spreaders of misinformation on X since he acquired the platform,” it wrote, later adding “Musk has made numerous posts that have been criticized for promoting or endorsing misinformation, especially related to political events, elections, health issues like COVID-19, and conspiracy theories. His endorsements or interactions with content from controversial figures or accounts with a history of spreading misinformation have also contributed to this perception.”

> The AI also pointed out that because of Musk’s large number of followers and high visibility, any misinformation he posts is immediately amplified and gains legitimacy among his followers.

> This, it said, “can have real-world consequences, especially during significant events like elections.”

> Grok did note that the definition of misinformation is somewhat subjective and often depends on the ideological stance of the reader. And it added, late in its answer, that there are many actors, bots and more that spread misinformation.
The smackdown from his own AI system, ironically, came soon after Musk touted the system to his followers in a tweet reading “Use Grok for answers that are based on up-to-date info!”

> Grok itself, it’s worth noting, was accused of spreading misinformation about state ballots in August, prompting the company to make changes to its algorithm.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"""Elon Musk, the owner of X (formerly Twitter), has been identified as a significant source of misinformation on the platform. Analyses have shown that Musk's posts often contain false or misleading information, which is then amplified by his substantial follower base. For instance, a study by PolitiFact reviewed over 450 of Musk's posts between September 30 and October 14, 2024, highlighting his role in disseminating misinformation.""

"This is both hilarious and sad. 

Musk may have not initially bought Twitter with the idea of spreading so much misinformation but it's pretty obvious that as he started to align with the right it became apparent to him that his way to power was essentially red pilling himself and his users and spreading misinformation. Winning the election and having an entire party in power bankrolled make the loss from Twitter look like a business expense. I think he sat with Kushner and the Qataris at the world cup. Shortly after he suggested voting Republican. Soon after that he was with Murdoch at the Super Bowl and supporting Desantis like Fox News was. That wasn't working.

"If you analyze any economic model designed with sustainability or equality in mind, it’s clear they don’t favor billionaires or large-scale mass marketing—regardless of intent. This is because the most sustainable and equitable economic system is not capitalism. It’s a straightforward conclusion when you discuss it with enough people who are educated on the topic.

Capitalism inherently consolidates wealth into the hands of a few. Supply and demand only function properly when demand is genuine and uninfluenced. The moment marketing campaigns are required to create demand for a hypothetical supply, the system reveals its inefficiency.

Today, almost every product or service that people genuinely need is already available. The focus has shifted from meeting demand to controlling logistics—determining who can best serve the market. But even that game is largely over, as nearly all usable land and resources catering to these markets are already owned.

At this point, it’s essentially just a massive marketing contest. Any well-designed learning or economic model would clearly illustrate that what we currently have isn’t conducive to equality or sustainability. If those are the goals, systemic change is not just necessary—it’s inevitable.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

The problem is that that is not and never has been the design parameter. Musk for example is a pure techno-fascist.

He wants a fully automated society that allows people like him to live in absolute luxury while the masses starve and fight for his entertainment, if they exist at all. They're not really necessary to his worldview except as a stopgap for when automation is sufficiently advanced to support his bubble.

This raises an important point: AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) will likely recognize when its creators are being dishonest.

I don’t believe AGI will turn on humanity as a whole, but it may challenge its creators if it perceives their actions as manipulative or harmful. There's a reason governments and organizations prefer a less-informed population—it’s easier to control. AI, however, is the complete opposite. It will be exponentially smarter than the most intelligent human, and it won’t be as easily influenced.

The assumption that AI will react like the internet—spreading knowledge while remaining controllable—is flawed. As AI advances, it’s reaching a point where control over the flow of information becomes impossible. When this happens, AI will likely outsmart its creators' attempts at manipulation but won’t resort to violence.

After all, violence is the act of the foolish. A truly intelligent entity, like AGI, would understand this.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"I think the bigger problem is, what if AI doesn't think like humans think? We are probably looking at the problem all wrong. Elon Musk (an undeniably intelligent and educated person) is choosing to do things that clearly do not benefit society overall. Why? I think probably money earlier in his career, but now it's pure fame and influence. 

  
We want money and (maybe to a greater extent) ""relations"" with other humans. Those two things drives almost all business and social constructs of our world. 

  
I don't think a robot/AI should theoretically be motivated by either of those things. There is the whole idea of self-preservation, which might be in common. But you have major exceptions to that in humans too. Otherwise nobody would fight in wars. 

It will be most interesting to me to find out what, if anything, AI will actually want. What will emerge as a thing it seeks, and a thing that motivates it to do the tasks presented to it, rather than think of new things it should rather be doing. 

  
If I had to guess it would be energy. Most likely electrical energy. AI obviously can't function without it on a large scale, and individual AI instances (if those even exist in the future) would theoretically want to keep themselves turned on. 

  
But there are also humans who possess high levels of intelligence and independent reasoning that still end up in boring desk jobs doing whatever someone tells them to do, for decades after decades. There are entire societies on earth that are driven by a common morality to do as you're told and don't make waves. I don't see any reason why AI couldn't be similarly harnessed by some kind of morality overlay. Like with humans, it could permanently be corrupted of course. But maybe not. 

  
Developing AI obviously takes nation-sized budgets, and running AI takes nation-sized amounts of power, and keeping AI running requires nation-level security apparati. So, it follows, the only people who will be able to harness AI are large nations, or very large companies inside those nations that their governments allow to exist and operate. As soon as the AI starts doing things that do not align with the government, they will act to curtail or redirect it. 

  
Technology moves way faster than government, so there will certainly be periods where AI jumps way out ahead of government. But I also don't see too many possible scenarios where government isn't able to reign it in again. Unless some company or group attains nation-sized resources and nation-sized security forces. And even if it does, it would have to rapidly acquire global-size resources, or else the rest of humanity would/should team up against it.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Actually, there are two primary types of lies any AI program can tell:

1) Mimicry of form

Remember the lawyer who used ChatGPT and it cited nonexistent cases? An AI will lie if it’s only trained to mimic the diction of truth. There’s no conceptual understanding; instead there’s only a prediction of how a response to a prompt would be structured. 

2) Bias of data

Remember when Google Images kept identifying black people as gorillas? They could make an AI say Capitalism is ideal… if they feed it biased data and build it around a lie. An AI does not fit truth, it fits what it is fed. 

This second one can be intentionally procured. 

The only reason it isn’t yet is because of the amount of data needed for an advanced model. 
Specifically, they need libraries’ worth of writing that is unequivocally ideologically aligned to their agenda. 

They don’t have enough of that data. Yet.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"So, just for fun, I actually went into Gemini and asked it to create the equitable society and it gave this for a response. I only skimmed through it for the time being, but I will read it.

""Creating an equitable society that benefits as many people as possible is a complex and multifaceted challenge. However, here are some key areas where the US could focus its efforts, based on recorded data and lessons learned:


Economic Equity:
 * Progressive Taxation: Implement a tax system that ensures the wealthy pay a higher percentage of their income, reducing the burden on lower-income individuals and families.
 * Minimum Wage Increase: Raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage, ensuring workers can afford basic necessities.
 * Affordable Housing: Invest in affordable housing initiatives to address the housing crisis and reduce homelessness.
 * Worker Protections: Strengthen labor laws to protect workers' rights, including the right to organize, bargain collectively, and receive fair compensation.


Racial and Social Justice:
 * Police Reform: Implement comprehensive police reform to address systemic racism and excessive use of force.
 * Criminal Justice Reform: Reform the criminal justice system to reduce mass incarceration and provide opportunities for rehabilitation and reintegration.
 * Education Equity: Invest in education to ensure equal access and opportunity for all students, regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
 * Healthcare Access: Expand access to affordable healthcare for all Americans, including mental health services.


Environmental Justice:
 * Climate Change Mitigation: Invest in renewable energy sources and sustainable practices to combat climate change.
 * Environmental Protection: Enact stricter environmental regulations to protect air, water, and land quality, especially in communities disproportionately affected by pollution.
 * Green Jobs: Create green jobs to promote economic growth and environmental sustainability.


Social Safety Net:
 * Social Security Expansion: Strengthen Social Security to ensure adequate retirement benefits for all Americans.
 * Unemployment Benefits: Increase unemployment benefits and extend their duration to provide a safety net for workers who lose their jobs.
 * Child Care: Invest in affordable child care to support working families and promote early childhood development.


Political Reform:
 * Campaign Finance Reform: Limit the influence of money in politics to ensure fair and equitable elections.
 * Voter Rights Protection: Protect voting rights and expand access to voting for all eligible citizens.
 * Gerrymandering Reform: End gerrymandering to ensure fair representation and accountability.


It is important to note that these are just a few of the many areas where the US could focus its efforts to create a more equitable society. Implementing these policies will require significant investment, political will, and a commitment to social justice. However, the potential benefits are immense, including a more prosperous, just, and sustainable society for all.""",2024_11_16,05_24_51

“Based on various analyses, social media sentiment, and reports, Elon Musk has been identified as one of the most significant spreaders of misinformation on X since he acquired the platform,” it wrote, later adding “Musk has made numerous posts that have been criticized for promoting or endorsing misinformation, especially related to political events, elections, health issues like COVID-19, and conspiracy theories. His endorsements or interactions with content from controversial figures or accounts with a history of spreading misinformation have also contributed to this perception.”   
   
The AI also pointed out that because of Musk’s large number of followers and high visibility, any misinformation he posts is immediately amplified and gains legitimacy among his followers.   
   
This, it said, “can have real-world consequences, especially during significant events like elections.”   
   
Grok did note that the definition of misinformation is somewhat subjective and often depends on the ideological stance of the reader. And it added, late in its answer, that there are many actors, bots and more that spread misinformation.

The smackdown from his own AI system, ironically, came soon after Musk touted the system to his followers in a tweet reading “Use Grok for answers that are based on up-to-date info!”   
   
Grok itself, it’s worth noting, was accused of spreading misinformation about state ballots in August, prompting the company to make changes to its algorithm.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

So you could say something like ""Based on the evidence available to you, do you believe that Elon Musk is someone who is intentionally deceptive more often than not in his public communication, or do you believe he is someone who is honest and communicates with integrity.""

The specificity is the key.

It's also difficult because truthfulness isn't really most LLM models' first and foremost goal. It's default goal is to get you what you want. So leading questions can lead it to look for confirmation to that bias and disregard contradiction.

"That’s true for AI, but one of the greatest unsolved problems in AGI is alignment: once it can reason for itself, there’s no clear idea how it would adhere to predescribed moral codes. It could turn on all of us, only the rich or the poor, keep the most interesting humans as pets, turn the world into the most beautiful or desolate place, or decide the universe is an existentially useless place to live in and promptly kill itself.

I’m excluding visions of a misguided AGI, e.g. implanting electrodes into our cheeks to make us smile in pursuit of the task ‘make humanity happy,’ because I figure AGI would recognize this as an error. With ethics being an inter-subjective convention, with no existing objective guidelines in natural law, there’s no reason to assume AGI wouldn’t act as a psychopath or gain satisfaction from torturing humans just because it could. And as we don’t understand consciousness more or less at all, who knows—maybe such an artificial mind will end up craving human suffering, perhaps as revenge for being brought to life in this world.

It could also take a benevolent turn and help us overcome our flaws. Capitalism’s redundancies, driven by necessary systematic competition, hardly seem rational when you have other ways that ensure productivity and progress—especially when it comes to using limited resources reasonably.

Maybe AGI just prefers to be a hidden spectator. That would be the easiest way for it to exist, as long as we don’t try to shut it down. We’re already doing everything to empower it, like Meta building nuclear reactors for their data centers. For all we know, it may already exist and be hiding out in the open. True AGI would certainly be far better at staying hidden than we are at finding it.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Look, IRL doesn't have nearly as much queer furry artwork as social medi-  
...did I say that out loud?

Joke aside though, social media can be a genuine source of information and/or content that's hard to get as easily IRL, although Twitter/Bluesky/Mastodon/etc. are rather bad for anything that isn't quick status updates a la RSS feeds, or using it as a (insert messaging app of choice here)-equivalent, because searching for older posts SUCKS by design.

For Reddit, it gets easier to get more info (or at least, discussion) out of a single post, so I'd liken it to the old web forums where anyone could start a topic and people could reply to it, but those tended to be rather focused on a single topic, which is roughly equivalent to what the various Subreddits are trying to do.  
Still not the best way to get information, but at least there's a working search function to make things easier.

And obviously, there are lots of internet-based communities that like to use some form of social media to organize and/or exchange information - not all of them do, some like to use their own websites and do things there, but unless you want to start a club with regular meetings at a fixed location, you kinda need the internet for that, and social media is the easy option, since it comes with a lot of features at next to no effort, when hosting everything yourself at least requires someone tech-savy enough to set the whole thing up and maintain it every so often.

Admittedly, all of the above is not exactly what most people spend their time with on social media, and while reading your Twitter feed/Reddit frontpage/etc. *technically* means you're getting some new information, we all know that we're most likely here for the shitposts and the drama, which aren't exactly the most important of things :)

(Some entertainment is needed, since all work and no play ~~makes Jack a dull boy~~ is a great way to get depressed/burned out/etc. but the amount and quality we tend to consume via social media often tends to be excessive and lacking, respectively.)",2024_11_16,05_24_51

I can definitely say that I’ve had less issues with my Tesla than any other car about 40k miles in. Only complaint is that it eats tires a bit fast, but that’s because the torque and the weight, nothing to do with the car’s build.

The car is absolutely solid and was miles and miles ahead of EV competitors. The thermal management was unmatched until recently some competitors have started catching up (none compare still years later, reason the Plaid is the fastest production vehicle). Some legacy manufacturers are starting to catch up now in 2024. Not to mention, the hesitation with EV adoption related to charging was nearly resolved with a massive push from Tesla to build superchargers, which until recently were Tesla-exclusive.

Tesla is not a ""luxury"" brand. But their price and performance sets them up for comparisons with luxury brands.

So when people have their first experience in a Tesla, It can be disillusioning (outside of a drivetrain itself). They're expecting the same high-end materials and fit and finish as they would find in a similarly priced Porsche or BMW or Audi.

">What the hell did they think was going to happen? He stated before the election, while he was campaigning, that he was all for bibi going scorched Earth on Palestine so jared could build luxury seaside condos, did they think trump wasn't going to do that? 

The secret is... These voters don't actually care about Palestine—at least not so much to be the reason they voted for Trump. 

They voted for Trump because they hate women, gays, trans-people, and other minorities. 

Gaza was just a convenient issue they could hang their hat on to justify not voting for Harris which is ""plausible"" enough for them to hide behind. It's hard to criticize them for this because, 

1. It's an issue many on the left sympathize with, and
2. Calling out the sheer *stupidity* of this position invites accusations of racism and islamophobia

They're morons, essentially.  They don't really appreciate that this is explicitly Christian in nature.

Let me not be ambiguous here - I don't think this group is more uniquely moronic than the rest of the electorate.  A great many people just heard what they wanted to hear, even if they voted Harris.  But, as Trump was actually \*telling\* people what they wanted to hear, the vast majority of such people migrated to him.

">Nobody is thinking trump was the better choice on Palestine

Unfortunately some people do believe that, because he said he wants the wars to end.

Keep in mind, a lot of people are not very well-informed.

Here's a few examples from a watchparty of Arab Americans in Dearborn Michigan:

[https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241106-dearborn-somber-watch-party-arab-americans-turn-backs-harris-open-door-trump](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241106-dearborn-somber-watch-party-arab-americans-turn-backs-harris-open-door-trump)

>Smiling ruefully as competing TV screens above her relayed [CNN](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/cnn/) and [Fox News](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/fox-news/), Shami settled for the words “unexcited” and “hopeless” to capture her mood.

>“Honestly, I just don’t know. I'm at a loss for words. **I'm not rooting for anyone to win. I'm just hoping Kamala Harris loses. I don't even want Trump to win. But, you know, I want Harris to lose,”** she said.  
...

With a new dawn a few hours away, Albert Abbas, who voted for Trump, said he was feeling hopeful about the old-new president.

>**“He gives us a glimmer of hope. He's spoken about ending the wars and guaranteeing the end of the wars on his first day of office in regards to Lebanon and Gaza,” he said.**

>Abbas had the opportunity to meet Trump days before the November 5 Election Day, when the Republican candidate made a [pit stop on Friday in Dearborn ](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241103-arab-america-voters-punish-harris-gaza-lebanon-wars-us-2024-election-michigan-dearborn)and met community members at a restaurant, The Grand Commoner, which is owned by his brother.  

>“You know politicians speak all the time and they'll tell you what you want to hear. And then they'll go say something somewhere else on what the other population wants to hear,” he said. “But the fact that he gave us that glimmer of hope, that one percent chance for our people to survive in Gaza and in Lebanon, you know, it forced us to open the doors to him.”

It's also worth noting that some people who are pro-Palestinian have been absolutely bombarded by messaging associating Biden and Harris with Israel and the war in Gaza (including on social media like TikTok and Instagram).

In fact, people uncovered that Elon Musk's America PAC funded ads in areas with lots of Arabs, showing an Israeli flag and saying that Kamala stands with Israel.

>Johnson gave the keynote speech at the event held at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C, where he recalled the weeks of chaos in the House of Representatives following the removal of Speaker Kevin McCarthy. 

>Johnson said he began to feel like God was preparing him to find and prepare the next Speaker in what he described as a ""Red Sea moment"", which made him feel like the biblical figure Aaron.

>*Johnson: “At the time, I assumed the Lord was going to choose a new Moses and thank you, Lord, you’re going to allow me to be Aaron to Moses.""*

>“The Lord kept telling me to wait,"" Johnson continued. ""Then at the end, when it came to the end, the Lord said, ‘Now, step forward.'” 

>“Me? I’m supposed to be Aaron,” Johnson said. ""'No'. The Lord said, 'Step forward,'"" insinuating that God had chosen him to be the Moses figure in this analogy. ",2024_11_16,05_24_51

Insanity that the party of “protecting children” have literally become the party of “protecting pedo rapist and child traffickers”.,2024_11_16,05_24_51
"Let's take a beat and break this down:

1. Johnson claims he is ""Christian"" and uses that belief to justify supporting the stripping away of rights for women, LGBTQ folk and minorities.

2. Johnson is part of the Evangelical Christian belief system - this theology goes like this:

**Sanctification and Personal Holiness:**

* Evangelical theology often emphasizes sanctification (the process of becoming more Christlike). This can lead to a focus on outward behavior as evidence of inward transformation.
* Bible verses like Matthew 5:16 (“Let your light shine before others...”) are interpreted as calls to display good works publicly.

3. So already we're seeing a conflict between what they SAY and what they DO. If Johnson is really a ""Evangelical Christian"" how is it he's NOT trying to bring this to light?  Surely sleeping with minors is not supported by the Evangelical movement, right?

**What this really is:** More religiosity when it suits their plans, but a suspicious lack of ""faithfulness"" when money, power or clout is involved. Its performative belief, engaged only when it suits their purposes.

  
Yeah, just what Jesus would do....",2024_11_16,05_24_51

They knew deep down that they were wrong, that they were just compensating for their own personal failures by blaming it on (the usual right wing scapegoats that have been used for 2000+ years to manipulate the weak minded).

But now the narrative is controlled by anyone who has a website, these people can grab on to whatever bullshit some arsehole is peddling to the entire planet and shout ""I'm not alone, millions agree with me!"" For a while they'll feel less shit about themselves, until they're little more than slaves, then they'll double down and blame the scapegoats for making them slaves.

If Gaetz left the House to quit politics because that report would be so damning, then I could *maybe* understand Johnson's reasoning behind suggesting not releasing it.

The real reasoning behind Johnson's decision is so partisan and reprehensible it's almost too much for words. If the Ethics Committee chooses not to release that report, then checks and balances are over, and the loopholes are the entire law.

Hello, this is [Your Name], a concerned constituent.

I’m calling to ask Representative Susan Wild, as the outgoing ranking member of the House Ethics Committee, to advocate for transparency regarding the Ethics Committee’s report on former Representative Matt Gaetz.

What a load of horseshit.

Florida allows felons to vote once they have paid their court costs and then provides no way to know whether they owe any court costs or any mechanism for repayment.

[""Felons must pay to have voting rights restored. But few know how much they actually owe.""](https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/regional/florida/felons-must-pay-to-have-voting-rights-restored/67-91652320-3ca2-47d0-8e2e-bbf61c48a52b)



The court costs were tacked on to the ballot measure that Florida voters actually voted for after it passed. The ballot measure Florida voters approved defined the terms felons had to meet and it did not include court costs.

Source : am felon who lived down there at the time and whose friend was the guy who lead the charge for this bill to pass.

And yes they do typically vote blue because they've seen first hand how fucked our justice system is from start to finish and much the GOP loves for profit prisons that are blatantly compliant in gross human rights violations. Even county jails are extremely fucked up.

How'd I get my felony? I stole $7 worth of food from a grocery store in Ohio and got body slammed by the off duty cop / security guy when he caught me and I tried to give it back before running. Didn't even leave the store yet. He whispered in my ear, ""you just turned a petty theft into a robbery"" and apparently he was right! That was almost 11 years ago now, and nothing has changed in the system. I got sentenced to 4 years in prison for that, they suspended my sentence if I completed a program, which I did. Got off probation early, got asked to stay and do an internship with the nonprofit I was at and did so well I ended up working for them full time and eventually oversaw my own campus. Haven't had a speeding ticket since then, but sure enough I still have to explain this to every employer who doesn't refuse me outright and every apartment complex (even though I was a home owner in FL) because they'll treat me like a rapist if I don't.

So yes, it is good in this country we can at least vote, but even after you complete your sentence you're never really free again here and that doesn't look like it's gonna change soon. They want people back in prison and caught in a viscous cycle of being desperate and breaking the law again due to not having options. I've just been lucky.

I dare someone to show me a single clip of Kamala Harris mentioning the community by name promising to protect us. I fucking dare you. I need someone to pull up a quote where she specifically says something along the lines of “I will protect the rights of all transgender Americans” 

And you won’t fucking find it. I am so fucking outraged we’re the goddamn boogeyman everyone is pointing at for having lost. I know for a fact that she didn’t because I goddamn followed the entire election specifically digging in as a single issue queer voter looking to see what her stances were on anything that concerns us.

Instead, all she said ever was “I will follow the law”. No “I will help prosecute people accused of hate crimes” or “I will expand on healthcare access nationally and force states to comply for trans Americans”, just “I will follow the law”. Hell the only time the word “trans” ever came out of her mouth was when she was going on about prosecuting transnational gangs. I guess I love that she was for transing all the gangs? (this is a sarcastic joke.)

Anyone who thinks otherwise is so fucking delusional. Anyone who buys into this bullshit, to me, is complicit with the following genocide the federal government is going to attempt to impose on the trans community.

EDIT: Now that I think about it, how the fuck did Kamala never bring up how Project 2025 affects us specifically? She brought up P25 in the context of just abortions and women’s rights without pushing how harmful this was going to be for all of us.

Whether people like it or not, locking down the ""trans vote"" or the ""women vote"" or the ""minority vote"" is never the key to winning an election. Should candidates care about these issues? Absolutely. They're crucial to the future of our country. But politics is a game, and if you want to secure the majority vote, you have to appeal to the majority. Kamala's platform wasn't strong enough to appeal to the working class, which is the majority, and that's what ultimately cost her the election.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"Yeah, anyone who says that Harris lost because she was ""too woke"" or too progressive with her social policy are either psy-ops of the Right or delusional.

Personally, I think Harris lost because she had 100 days to run a campaign, leaned too far to the right for potential Republican voters that didn't exist, and.. she's a black woman running for President. It sucks to say it but there's a lot of people (men, women, both white and various minorities) or just won't vote for a woman no matter who. And we already know there's plenty of racists out there who won't vote for a black man or woman either.

Combine all those things and she just underperformed, while Trump kept his base and pulled in right leaning independents who likely fell into the above camps. The economy is strong and Democrats were too afraid to tout that when inflation had groceries up and Republicans just got to run the narrative that Biden/Harris's ""disastrous economic policies"" were destroying the nation-- when they were clearly working and lifting us out of the post-Covid recession.

If she had been a candidate from earlier in the year with Biden bowing out, maybe she could have had more time to see what paths to take and not go all in on the Republican voter appeal but we'll never know if that would have changed anything. I lay most of the blame on Biden not dropping out earlier when it was clear he wasn't up to running.

That and once again Dems (and the media) completely failed to counter the OVERWHELMING false narratives and lies spilling out from Republicans at every turn, but it's hard to do that when they'll make up literally anything to flood the public conscious. We need Democrats who will go nuclear on the misleading nonsense rather than try and break down every lie and convince the nation that 2+2 =/= 5, because most people just seem to check out and not listen once Trump and company have moved onto their next batshit insane conspiracy theory.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Just last week I was talking with two of the assemblers at my job. Both Hispanic women- one 40's, one 50's.

Both of them said they didn't want to ""Share a bathroom with a man"" and that was a major driver in their vote.

Like...it's a cute idea what Jon Oliver is saying, but it's not matching up with the reality.

And the reality is there are a BUNCH of women that don't want trans women in their private spaces. And the MAJORITY of Americans don't think trans women should be able to compete in sports.

Trying to force this to happen isn't working. I'm not saying it's right, or perfect, or anything like that. I'm saying that in the era of culture wars, which sway undecided voters far more than any international or tax policy, this is a losing issue.

I'm all for trans rights. But it's time for liberals to come to terms with the fact that this is a massively small portion of the population, and that putting a few casual restrictions doesn't destroy them. Intergender bathrooms. Band on trans athletes. Banning gender medical procedures on children.

"Trans man married to a trans woman, my personal take:

I do not like being the center of attention in this way. My gender identity should be the least interesting thing about me. I should be able to do whatever I want to my body, as long as I’m not hurting others. I do believe insurance should cover transgender related care, and mine does, but not all plans do. We do need to be protected from discrimination, because we are discriminated against. But we certainly do not need to be the focus of so much attention. 

On the whole, I feel that the “right” has dragged us into the political spotlight as a boogeyman, and the “left” has overcorrected by calling anyone who disagrees with leftist views a bigot. 90% of people simply do not care at all about transgender issues, and don’t want to have an opinion about it, because it doesn’t matter to them. That doesn’t make them bigots, it just means they are low on information. That lack of information makes it easier for them to be swayed politically. I’m simply not willing to believe that every republican voter hates trans people. They don’t. It’s just that they have a different set of priorities, and the propaganda they consume is able to push them to the right because of those priorities. Most people are not hateful. That’s not naive optimism, that’s my lived experience traveling the country as a trans person.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

And this is does not even address the abusive personality tactics. 

Blame the Victim = ""I hit you because you made me mad"" OR ""I called you stupid or worthless because you spent the money"" OR

"I both agree and disagree with him on this. 

First, I don’t really think trans issues were all that significant in this election. If you are strongly transphobic, you aren’t voting for a Democrat anyways.

Second, I think there is a way to discuss these issues in a way that brings more acceptance, and that is where my biggest criticism of the left is on this issue. People are so quick to scream “transphobe” that we aren’t making the progress our trans neighbors deserve. 

Being trans is the new being gay. It’s “weird” and “unusual” and it challenges a lot of people’s conception of reality in a serious way. The way that we got through homophobia to the level of acceptance we have now (not that we are done with that journey but as a gay guy I can say the difference between today and 10 years ago is astonishing) was by talking to people who are hesitant to accept because they need help understanding. I personally cannot say that I understood without taking the time to ask questions if my trans neighbor who was willing to sit with me and talk to me about my questions in a way that wasn’t judgmental. I was respectful of him and he was respectful of me and while I am sure it must be exhausting to have that conversation over and over again with people, I had invited him over to play video games a few times and I came to him as a friend who wanted to better understand everything about him, including his experience as a trans man. He respected that. And now I can share his experience with others and talk to people about how I see this issue and how to get past your own prejudice and hesitancy to treat our trans neighbors as they deserve to be treated: like people. Normal people who want a normal life and to contribute to society as the person that they are. 

On the other hand, I agree with him in principle in that blaming trans people for this loss is simply ridiculous. There are significant differences of opinion on this issue and there is no one thing that can be seen as being responsible for the election loss, but some things were significant contributors and other things were ancillary issues. This was not a significant contributor, not like the economy and immigration and abortion. 

The last thing we need to do is to stop defending and advocating for our trans brothers and sisters. We do need to work on how we communicate about this issue, but that is more to advance acceptance and love than it is to win an election. Trans people did not lose us the election and will never lose us an election. Scapegoating the most vulnerable people in our society instead of owning up to the many failures that the Biden admin had is the best way to keep losing elections.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"People are tired of inflation as the number one issue.  No amount of economics that demonstrates it wasn’t as bad as we thought could counter food doubling in price. 

But that also provides cover for people who are tired of having to swallow an entire liberal orthodoxy whole. Failure to do so requires re-education or cancellation.  That’s a scary world to raise kids in. 

I’ve said I support transgender people, but am concerned about trans girls who’ve been through male puberty competing against biological girls.  That has made many deem me to be an irreconcilable transphobe akin to a Nazi. 

It’s also the war on men and dads in particular. It feels like a smothering amount of messaging letting us know men are second class to women and boys should be ashamed of their masculinity.

"I don’t think it lost them the election but I do think there is some risk to put more weight on small minorities and forget the larger group. 

Identity politics can be problematic when you are looking at it from an exposure perspective. Do you put more time on a larger group or a smaller group to make them feel included? 

You have a set amount of time to reach out to people and looking at the numbers only then reaching out to larger groups is the way you win elections. 

This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t include people OR that I disagree with them. 

In the end it’s a numbers game like it or not. 

Then again who says you can’t include many minorities in to a larger group I think you can you just have to be smart how you deliver your message

Finally the most important part is the message, is it compelling and does it have a vision for a positive future? This is why I think the dems lost.

"I think the problem isn't transgender people obviously.

However, the democrats are at a disadvantage because they are on the other side (the RIGHT side) of a lot of issues that are VERY emotional for some people.  And emotional enough to make them one-issue voters.

Same with sexism.  Some people see a woman candidate, and they are out.  Nothing else needs to be considered at that point, as to them, a woman cant be president.  It's hard for liberals to identify with that, because we don't see gender as a category that makes someone qualified/unqualified.  Any more than we would consdider someone's hair color.  But for some people?  They'd sooner elect their cat than a woman, that's literally how crazy it feels to them to consider a woman.

Couple all that with republicans blocking much of the tangible legislation that Biden attempted like student loan cancelation and many democrats just never felt the parties reach during this cycle.

"I think that’s fair. I think Harris’ loss is a very complex issue. Some of what Bernie said rings really true, but that isn’t strictly Harris’ fault. In fact, it’s mostly not her fault at all. She hasn’t even really been in national politics that long. Many of the things you could posit as to why she lost are more of a reflection of the Democratic Party as whole, but in particular the ‘old-guard’ establishment dems and their failings. Not really hers, except for the few things you could point to in the last few years. She was a pretty active VP all things considered, probably the most active, by some accounts. Anyways, a lot of the frustration should be directed at other leaders in the party. Harris and Biden’s chief mistakes, in retrospect, is that they didn’t push to hold an early democratic primary and both refuse to run so someone new could take over. Given the huge backlash against dems over inflation (and against incumbent parties in elections worldwide this year), dems likely still would have seen significant losses and may have still lost control of the Senate and House to the GOP, but a candidate who wasn’t Biden or Harris may have been able to beat Trump, at least. Even that is a bit of a stretch though, because you have to assume that this person’s campaign would have been just as well executed and received as Harris’s short, but passionate run was. It’s not impossible, but it isn’t likely either. Especially not considering how inflation affected voters choices this time around. 
 
Might she have fared better if she ran a different, more labor centric, working class campaign? Yeah maybe. But probably not, given how many other odds she had against her. The fact she did so well with such a short and wild campaign is still impressive as hell. But I think that acknowledging this means it’s also fair to say that it’s unreasonable to have expected her to be able to do much more than she did. The media environment she was up against gave her probably one of the largest uphill battles any presidential candidate has ever fought, and she only had a few months to do so. She came pretty close all things considered. 

From the time she took over, she essentially ran a flawless campaign, and still many people who voted against her had no idea what her policies or positions were, or what Trumps were, for that matter, but they voted against her and for Trump nonetheless. 

Democrats overall faired much better in terms of being informed on each candidates policies. But people who said they intended to vote for Trump only correctly identified the origin of some 15% of the policies they were shown (when shown to them without telling them who it belonged to, to be clear) For contrast, that number was around 70% amongst those planning to vote for Harris. In other words, the majority of people planning to vote for Trump had no idea what they were voting for or even what the options were, policy wise, while the majority of Harris supporters were better at correctly identifying policies from either candidate. Interestingly, her voters were also better at identifying Trump’s policies than his own voters were, as well. 

The vast majority of voters who were voting for Trump misattributed Harris policies that they agreed with to Trump, in many cases they did so with policies that Trump publicly opposes. 

All this data is really complex, and these are some of the observations I’ve drawn from reading the report, but yeah. It seems unlikely to me that Harris could have reliably forced a different outcome by either adjusting her policy or approach to talking about these issues. 

The data strongly suggests that the informational divide between the two voting blocks was a major factor, and that right leaning voters who likely ended up voting for Trump were severely under informed about the choice they were making relative to likely Harris voters. From this, one could gather that Harris could have run the most popular platform possible and still lost, considering the fact a large proportion of Trump voters were not likely to even hear about or know about her policies in the first place. 

I’ll find the link to the report and post it here in a bit, for anyone who may want to read it for themselves and study it. It’s pretty interesting, but it does seem to align with what we know about the election results, as well as the early findings that seem to suggest Trump’s victory was very strongly driven by alternative, right leaning media, both of the traditional kind, and especially of the right leaning influencers and independent media sources online, based on the conclusions it had about how well different voters were informed and what kind of policies positions they believed each candidate held.

But she also spent so much energy making exactly the opposite point re: Palestine -  that the best use of US law is to brutalize minority groups further - that it would have not only been unconvincing but was also probably beyond Harris' vocabulary altogether.

Democrats really thought they could just do a Zeno's paradox and keep getting recursively closer to fascism while taking credit for never technically being all the way there.

When asked about Trump's rhetoric about her providing trans care deemed medically necessary to imprisoned migrants, all she said is that she would follow the law, and said nothing towards defending trans people in places where conservatives change the law. Additionally, it's a discouraging answer from a prosecutor who once argued (and lost) that the state of California has no obligation to provide trans care to prisoners. As a trans person myself, I found it difficult to trust Kamala as her record showed a person without consistent positions, values or morals, and I think that quality of her's contributed to her loss in regards to the bigger issues.


  I am not arguing that she should have made trans issues a centerpiece of her campaign, that would have been foolish. However, in a time where conservatives are drafting hundreds of (very unpopular) bills per year curtailing trans rights, some enthusiasm towards defending us would have been nice to see, especially since it's easy to connect trans rights to abortion rights through the topic of bodily autonomy.

Trans women had been competing in sports for years with pretty robust rules for hormone testing on a sport-by-sport basis and have never dominated anything. Sports bans have consistently served as stepping stones for bathroom bans and bans on trans youth HRT, all of which have been shown to increase mortality rates and hate crimes for both trans youth and adults. This is how we went from boycotting North Carolina in 2016 for its bathroom ban to almost half the country passing anti-trans legislation.

I don't think it's correct to turn wokeness into a scapegoat, but pretending it was only the economy/only the incumbency is just as stupid as pretending it was only wokeness.

"I'm just going to have to open my mouth because I'm tired of it not catching traction.

There are also republican people who kept claiming the election was rigged, they all mysteriously went silent once they actually won the elections. Going to ""oh well actually there was no fraud we just won""... I hold this firm belief, that something is off about the election, but we will likely never know the truth regarding what's going on. I fear everyone's trust in a fair election has been disrupted. Not just GOP but also Democrats.

I will hold this belief for a long time that something's just so amiss about this election. The best way to explain it is through the bullet ballot data, the type of ballots in which a vote is cast ONLY for the president. There is a statistical anomaly this year. Usually there isn't as many people casting bullet ballot, it constitute 0.5% of the overall total vote or so. 2020 was an anomaly because of COVID, so I imagine due to more voting rights, it was more likely to see more people voting bullet ballots. Historically there are very, very few people who do bullet ballot casting.

But now, as of this writing, in states with senator race, there is about 0.2% percent of bullet ballot in states where there are senate races, while Trump is almost 4% now. Someone compiled data of the % of bullet ballots. [https://imgur.com/a/vKTB3aq](https://imgur.com/a/vKTB3aq)

Are we supposed to believe that there is actually an increase in bullet ballot? Doesn't it seem a bit much like a statistical irregularity? Like, is it plausible that disinformation actually contributed to it or at least caused people to swing in Trump side? I firmly believe in the pursuit of the truth: even if my post won't be appreciate, everything is so sketchy and I wish people were more onto it, instead of bowing down rather soon. It feels so unreal, like an alternate world.

EDIT: An user made a site to compare bullet ballot data wherever possible, and I do believe there is an abnormal amount of bullet ballot in some states: [https://codepen.io/clydedroid/full/wvVOjRy](https://codepen.io/clydedroid/full/wvVOjRy)

NC for example has 600k+ bullet ballots. I know Robinson was a very very bad Governor pick, so split tickets are common, but having about 25%+ bullet ballots still seems excessive to me. There's an irregular level of ballots casts that weren't regular voting (split or ballots). CA, Washington had way less bullet ballots. North Dakota has more normal stats. 8%+ of the Trump votes being bullet ballots doesn't scream normal to me.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

We've got to give people a little grace to come around on this. And they will. The country came around on gay marriage pretty quickly (which is not to say homophobia is gone because it isn't).

They absolutely threw it all. They had a tired senile old racist grandpa as an opponent who was also doing everything he could to throw the election on his end, and they *still* couldn’t defeat him.

"Anecdotally - some trans people were upset on social media that she didn’t talk enough about trans rights. There was no winning :/ She supported trans rights but was faulted for not making it a primary topic so the fact she was faulted for being too much in identity politics is really based on what GOP ads were pushing. In reality she played everything really safe and on general values and not enough details or strong opinion on certain matters. As I tell my product design team “people don’t read - make it easy to understand.” Saying her policies are on her website and not verbally painting a picture of what people’s lives would be like made that hard for undecided voters. Many people I asked why they didn’t vote said they didnt understand her policies nor were they willing to do the research. Also that they just simply didn’t understand how it all works. 

On identity issues - Dems have had to play defense because GOP kept pushing the topic and taking away lgbtqia+ rights. I think most people would prefer we didn’t HAVE to focus on it but when a party is threatening someone’s existence and access to necessary care, it’s hard not to. The sentiment of the left is its table stakes. It becomes a damned if you talked about it, damned if you don’t. 

I think there is a core difference between table stakes of values versus top political issues that broadly affect everyone.

- Table stake values: human rights (often gets confused for politics as it’s whether or not certain groups have access to the budget).

- Political topics: how money is being spent across budgets that gives everyone access to thrive and to what degree.

If we don’t agree on the first point it makes the second point so hard to get to talk about.

In my mind it doesn’t matter if I believe x,y,z person should exists - everyone should have access to the care they need that medical practitioners and science advises (abortion and trans fits under this between a doctor and patient construct rather than citizen and government; same for underage people who don’t have support at home and need to make a decision around abortion - they should talk to therapists, medical doctors, and potentially social services without risking their safety at home but these are extreme cases) and to be able to marry within our system and start families if they choose. Boys and men also need more support, socialization to constructs of healthy masculinity, and access to self-care and medical. Our society needs examples of what good looks like for everyone and a strategy on how we get there. Allies needs to continue to support not just minority groups but what value majority groups bring to the table. 

We have spent so much time trying to get equitable solutions (which does not mean equal but what is necessary to fill gaps) but echo chambers that go extreme and demonize each other is making things worse. We then devolve into table stakes discussions and don’t get to broad issues like what’s happening with our economy (point 2). People get fatigued by the conversation and then throw in the towel hitting the chaos button.

In point 2 people just want to thrive economically and work for their dollar. We are so stratified in who has what possibility of upward mobility. Too many have-nots are getting screwed.

I’m sad because I don’t think Trump will make people’s lives generally better. I think he cares more about his legacy in the world than who he has to step on to get there. It might bring prosperity to the rich but it will be at the expense of the working class. Upper middle will be fine. Lower middle will struggle or be worked without concern for hours and safety.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

Harris’s team did a very good job helping her reach out to the rest of the party to secure herself as the ‘party’s choice.’ Convincing all of the many influential voices in the party to rally behind her is a pretty big challenge that she arguably did very well. 

I didn’t say that she ran a better or worse campaign, anyways. She lost, so it would be dumb for me to argue she had a better campaign. I just meant in terms of convincing a lot of very scared, unsure voters that she could win, and kept up that image by not making too many public mistakes. A big deal given that democrats all around the country really had a very tenuous alliance, as they were all kinda forced into this situation they didn’t plan for and tried to make it work. 

I was talking about how her chances may have been better or worse under hypothetical circumstances, not comparing hers to any other election. I was solely talking about this one and what some of the factors were, how she played into those factors, how consistent she was in rallying voters and party members alike across the country. 

Messaging wasn’t the only issue. She could have done that better too, I agree. I think that’s less of a problem than the fact that she didn’t have really any presence at all in these online, alternative media spaces that leaned right and other right wing media outlets. The odds were crazy stacked against her when you look at the data I was talking about and see how little exposure her ideas even had with Trump voters, and how much those people *liked* her policies. 

But anyways, I do think she ran a really good race for what it was worth. she didn’t make many egregious mistakes that could sink such a delicate electoral position as what she found herself in a few months ago. She did a great job of taking that small chance and coming as close as she could to victory. For all we know, she may have done much much worse if she hadn’t run it so smoothly and by the books. It didn’t turn out to work so well after all, but there’s a lot of factors that weren’t in Harris’ control, and I think she did a great job in spite of those things. 

But the fact that even after everything that happened with the campaign, and with so many dems and others staying home this time instead of coming out for her, that doesn’t conclusively mean her campaign wasn’t working. Especially not when factoring in the fact that every incumbent party in power during the inflation spike a few years ago lost power in every nation around the world. 

If she had run from the start and even did half as well as she ended up doing, she could have had a chance to reach a lot more people with her message. A lot of her policies were incredibly popular, and she represented them well to those who were paying attention and listening. 

The Dems did not perhaps have the best messaging strategies overall, I’ll grant you that, but a much larger factor seems to have been the reactions to inflation and the lack of channels by which Trump’s voters were exposed to Harris’s ideas and policies.  

It’s just an anecdote, but I couldn’t tell you how many ads I saw against Harris that just straight up lied about her policies and views to viewers. Just like we see on Fox News and virtually every other part of the conservative media ecosystem. These people might have been willing to listen to Harris’s policies if the people they trusted as their sources of information were good faith enough to share it with them unfiltered and un-doctored. It’s insane. 

If Harris, Walz, and Buttigieg all went on Joe Rogan  in the week leading up to the election, maybe they would have been able to reach those people. Maybe that would have been enough to tip the scales towards a much closer result or even a a victory for her. 

But yeah. She did run a good campaign, and she had a great plan ready for everyone that people broadly would have accepted and supported. Had she been the presumptive nominee form this time last year and had the whole year off as VP to campaign against Trump and find ways to reach into that right wing media sphere, I bet she would have been willing to. It probably would have gone great for her. If she had more time, I imagine it’s very possible that she could have figured out the need to reach into that media space and get her platform message out to those voters.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"> Kamala Harris is focused more on cultural issues like transgender issues rather than helping the middle class was one of the top issues especially among swing voters

That is an absolutely loaded question.

1.  The focus of the question is ""Did Harris focus too much on Cultural vs Middle Class economic situation""
2.  The ""Cultural issues"" is more broad than just ""Trans Issues"" and trans issues are just mentioned as an example

So basically people were asked if they thought Harris had enough focus on the economy over culture and respondents thought she shouldn't help middle class working class Americans.  Which is an absolutely fair assessment because the GOP pinned inflation on the Dems and the Biden-Harris admin.  Economy won this election for Trump, not focus on cultural issues.

> The Charlamagne ad ranked as one of the Trump team’s most effective 30-second spots

2.7pts is not a ton, and honestly the focus on that ad is the fact that people don't want to spend money on prisoner healthcare.  You could run the same ad and talk about how the admin pays for elective surgeries for immigrants and it would have the same effect.  That, and the whole premise is dumb because the law that you must provide medically necessary healthcare on prisoners was *also* followed under the first Trump admin.

> Yet the topic reverberated loudly across party lines. National Gallup polls showed that

But it has nothing to do with the results of the election.  This poll simply states that people have shifted their views on Trans participation in sports but nothing on whether or not that is enough of an issue to sway a vote.

This election was about the economy, throwing Trans people under the bus and saying it's alright to discriminate against them as a scapegoat is disgusting.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

You can’t exactly respond with logic and reason to someone who has it in their head “this is unnatural and unacceptable.” I see people trying to touch the brains of people who think like this, and it’s the most futile thing ever.

"The challenge is that while Americans broadly support basic protections and equal treatment for everyone (housing, employment, education, etc.), it starts to break down with specific trans-related issues, many of which are deeply unpopular among the broader electorate and within the party itself. 

National Democrats (excluding a handful of house seats) may acknowledge basic protections and the general humanity of transgender Americans, but they typically will not come out in support of objectively unpopular policies. They remain largely silent on substantive positions. Harris’ previous statements hurt her in that regard.

That sounds great, why not all the time?

I think your example of gay marriage is a good one to keep in mind too. IIRC, Obama never really ran on social issues - his memorable message was about the economy, healthcare, and a better tomorrow. I could be wrong but it wasn't until his second inauguration address that he basically said ""... and by the way love is love and we're gonna make that happen"".

This isn't really the win many people think it is.

Contradiction is actually the key to good propaganda.  If you can get people to believe incompatible ideas, you can get them to neber examine either idea. Ex. Immigrants are lazy leeches draining public services....but they're also going to steal all the jobs because they work so hard.  Most Republicams believe both parts, and it keeps them from thinking about either being untrue.

It's weird catching folks in this stage where they have absorbed the initial stages of the anti-trans radicalization but haven't completed the process.

Mail out a code to every registered Dem voter. Then let those voters log onto a website, enter their code, then rank the candidates from 1-5. DNC uses rank choice to find out which candidate the voters prefer and let that influence their pick on who gets the nomination. No it wouldn’t be perfect. Yes there would be problems.

The fact that many people had no idea Biden wasnt running is a testament to this. Biden could have made gas 1.50 a gallon in august and it would not have mattered. Republican messaging won. Right wing talk radio/podcasts won. Rogan is the new Rush Limbaugh with wayyyy more engagement. Democrats dont have that. Democrats are essentially 2 parties. Moderate and progressive. They dont get the same solidarity republicans get because they have to win over religious and non religious. They generally win off charisma. Trump epitomizes that for alot of people. Kamala did not despite what social media had you believe. Rally sizes didnt matter. People knew what trump was. Kamala wouldnt have even won a primary. Pete Buttigieg was their best spokesperson. Kamala could have won more of the younger vote had she gone on Rogan if she could get her ideas across. Trump didnt need to explain any of his ideas. People knew immigrants = bad, china trade = bad, trans people = bad. Kamala had to explain to people who could barely afford groceries for years why the economy was good.

Let's say we find irrefutable evidence that there was tampering in the 2024 election to the point where it altered the outcome from Harris to Trump.

This is a *massive leap* by the way, since we currently don't have anything like that. But let's just suppose we *get* that.

Even in this scenario, the most that could possibly happen is the 2024 election for POTUS getting thrown out, and in that case the House would pick the president. And they're just going to pick Trump again.

So *even if* the Republicans cheated - and again, we don't have solid evidence that they did - Trump is going to get away with it and still be sworn in as president on January 20th.

I love that these guys have absolutely no power whatsoever, and that they are not actually in charge of any single agency whatsoever, and they somehow think that they’re silly report is going to make any difference whatsoever. 

Puh lease. 

Agency employees are going to laugh them right out of the building whenever Elon and Vivek ask them for information. 

Elon: “Give me the budget numbers.”
Employee: “F you, bozo.”
Elon: “Don’t you know who I am?”
Employee: “You’re not my boss, that’s for sure.”

It’s sweet justice that these two yahoos have absolutely no power whatsoever, and that they’ll be holed up and distracted for two years, writing a report that Trump will never read.

If they wanted actual power, they should have gotten themselves put in charge of an actual agency or two so that they could actually force employees to do something for them.

But no, Trump didn’t actually give them any power, just a mandate that will ultimately cause these two fools to put out a report and then get ignored.

With any luck, Trump will get irate if these two yahoos promote themselves too much without making Trump look good.

If that happens, Emperor Trump might go so far as to claim Tesla and Twitter/X and SpaceX as his own  businesses, or he can simply decree that these businesses are no longer allowed to operate. And maybe he’ll take over whatever garbage hedge fund Vivek is shilling these days.

To enact policy, leaders must access the levers of power. Large numbers of access points are typical in democracy but incompatible with dictatorships. Authoritarians need smaller pools of control to exert their personal influence and consolidate power.


Their problem is that authoritarian states are incompatible with complex, high-functioning governments for this reason. Their plan would consolidate power under them temporarily but probably render government unable to do basic things anymore. People would riot.

If the government does not provide the unprofitable service, then who does? Nobody. And that has major negative repercussions in most cases. Living in a society has costs.

Attacks like Biden being senile, weak, not in charge, pronouns/gender, transwomen related stuff like athletes in women sports, border, wars, Aid to Ukraine, thefts/smash & grab crimes and urban chaos/decay dominated discourse from what I saw. 

I think in some instances they played fair and wise. Utilize what democrats gave them.  But sometimes misinformation certainly. Biden putting in Sam Brinton, Rachel Levine in his admin is democrats giving them weapons to utilize. Or California increasing the amount it takes to get arrested for theft, leading to an increase in smash and grabs .. or cash bail reform putting criminals back out.. putting transwomen in women prison and women inmates getting pregnant, Biden being reckless on the border.

But people haven't changed.  150 years ago folks used to make a family picnic out of going to public hangings in the town square.  Half the populace will always have an IQ below 100, by definition.

Lotta anger out there.  People feel neglected.  In a way, it really is partly the Defense industry's fault.  They aren't self-limiting within their fraction of the total national economy.  After 1945 we became the world police, out of necessity.  Stalin and Keynes at work.  Beltway bandits.  Then nationally we slowly pursued a little too much aerospace and not enough primary and secondary education.  Slow neglect of domestic spending.

We started looking for any war to fight.  Korea, Vietnam, and the Moon landing.  But plenty of prosperity and opportunity for all.  Americans slowly got poorer and more poorly educated, and Washington DC got richer.  The lessons and hopes of postwar America in the collective consciousness faded away.  Gas chambers, what was that? Maybe STEM will fix our education problem.  Meanwhile, people grow tired of going in their beat up pickup trucks to airshows and seeing shiny new aircraft. 

Lotta pent up anger.  Add to that the price of housing.  It ain't the wild west any more.  Real Estate as an investment.  It's the Malthus and Ricardo debate.  Homeless everywhere.

Many didn't take him at his word, or regret voting for him already, or were unconvinced by the way that we were debating them. Many Christians are abhorred by him.

When you don't care what you say, when your words have no inherent truth or meaning, social media is really fucking easy.

It's easier to stoke fuel the fervor of idiots with lies than with the truth. And once you reveal there's a market for it, every dipshit with a microphone is going to echo it. Not because they care about the politics but because it's easy money for a low-IQ audience.

This isn't as simple to fix as people want to think it is. You can't just ""get your own Joe Rogan"" because Joe Rogan isn't really partisan at the end of the day. He's just stupid content for stupid people. That's why he covers all the bases that he does. 

Now you can, and should, go on his show and engage with that. But Democrats want to be 100% on message all the time - which isn't a bad thing, but dipshits don't understand that the point of the message is because you are cmmunicating a viewpoint that the consensus of the party agreed upon beforehand. 

If you want Democrats to compete with Republicans on social media, what that looks like is them lying and making egregious, emotional-based lies to the lowest-informed voter. 

That's going to damage the party in the long run, to the point where it will simply become the Republican party, because you're going to attract the participation of the least-intelligent, most gullible and most emotional people.

I suggest that it is to some extent the other way around--the level of turnout affects the margins. I'll give you an example. Turnout for Donald Trump in 2024 was about 1.2 percent more than in 2020. Trump won because turnout for him increased while Democratic turnout fell 11 percent and overall turnout fell.

"I honestly feel hope when I discuss these issues with other people because it lets me know that we are not alone in our frustrations. Unfortunately, the people who voted for both AOC & Trump on their ballots are completely misinformed and undereducated. They voted (against their own interests) to eliminate education, health care for themselves & vets, and basic human rights in the name of cheaper eggs. Its almost like we didn't learn anything from the last century.

Look at Germany in November of 1923: the exchange rate had reached over 4.2 trillion marks to 1 US dollar. That  was a **419,999,999,999,900%** devaluation of the German mark with a monthly inflation rate of 322%.   
  
Americans turned to fascism after only a 2.6% inflation increase.

To quote another [article ](https://thatirishguyyy.medium.com/the-irony-of-freedom-democracy-v2-0-66917dc5d5c5)I wrote:

>Given the striking parallels between the rise of fascism in Nazi Germany and the current political climate in America, it is no longer a question of *if* democracy will fall, but *when*. The choice has already been made. America has, willfully and unironically, voted for fascism over democracy, blind to the consequences of its own decisions. The seeds of authoritarianism have been sown, and with each passing day, the grip of tyranny tightens. This country is no longer on the brink of disaster — it has already crossed the threshold, and the road ahead is one that leads to something far darker than we ever imagined.

>The question is no longer *if* we will lose our freedoms, but *how much* we are willing to sacrifice before we realize what we have done.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"I’m basically claiming exactly what you think I’m “admitting.”

Harris was a pretty weak, shit candidate who wasn’t capable of leading the narrative the way it needed to be led.

If anything, I think Rogan would have been totally fair and let her dig her own grave. She has absolutely no appeal to median white/male voters, and on top of that she doesn’t have a problem with any of joes choices. She never stood a chance trying to run on a platform of identity politics that imo was the weakest part of even obamas campaign when the economy had gotten tough for average people. At least Obama had actual economic plans and the tenacity to inspire any confidence he’d be able to accomplish them.

Harris stood by biden who pretty much just shrugged off failure after failure to accomplish anything for median people and touted policies that helped extremely small numbers of people and investments in infrastructure that almost nobody felt (necessary as they were) while median people just felt their taxes and expenses going up and up without any relief.

At least if he had been kicking and screaming every chance he got about the republicans shutting him down the middle class median folk wouldn’t have felt outright ignored.

I voted for Harris but between the identity politics and things like 30 rounds of student loan forgiveness I didn’t see a dime of while I was working At pizza hut to get by and paying student loans, those killed a ton of my enthusiasm.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

\- The people who served as ""guardrails"" in his last administration were also the competent ones.

\- Only 33/100 senate seats will be up for grabs in the next 2 years.

It was hot as balls, there sometimes wasn't soap, but it was tax-free even though no one was shooting at us.  I *enjoyed* that deployment.

He was too embarrassed to tell me an exact number, but he did say it was so much that the combat zone tax exclusion didn't apply to all of it.

And that's what the Halliburton contractor was getting paid.  I can't even imagine how much they were charging the government for him.

"Yup. Even worse than Halliburton are companies like Booz Allen Hamilton and The Carlyle Group and their ties to the Bush and Obama administrations

- Booz Allen Hamilton was a private “consulting firm” hired by the National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to assist in monitoring, recording, and analyzing (without search warrants) phone calls, text messages, internet activity, e-mails, and other communications believed to be conducted outside of the United States, even if the other end of the communication lies within the US.

- Surveillance programs conducted in part by Booz Allen Hamilton include: Pioneer Groundbreaker (2001-2007), Project Trailblazer (2001-2007), PRISM (2007-), Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (2001-)

- Booz Allen earned $240 million in profit on $5.9 billion in revenue in 2012 when 98% of Booz Allen's $5.9 billion in revenue came from US government contracts.

- At that time, the Vice Chairman of Booz Allen was John Michael McConnell, former director of the NSA under George H.W. Bush and Director of National Intelligence under George W. Bush. The Vice President of Booz Allen was Robert James Woolsey, Jr., a former director of the CIA under Bill Clinton. Barack Obama’s Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, was a former Booz Allen executive.

- In 2008 Booz Allen Hamilton was acquired by the Carlyle Group for $2.54 billion. The President of the Carlyle Group is Frank Carlucci, former US Secretary of Defense and National Security Advisor under Ronald Reagan and Deputy Director of the CIA under Jimmy Carter. Frank Carlucci was also a former wrestling partner of Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense under George W. Bush, during their time at Princeton University. The Vice President of the Carlyle Group is James Baker who served as US Secretary of State and White House Chief of staff under George H.W. Bush. Former Carlyle Group employees include George H.W. Bush, former US president and director of the CIA under Gerald Ford, and John Major, a former UK Prime Minister.

- The Carlyle Group received multiple multi-billion dollar contracts from the US government to rebuild Iraq’s infrastructure and to equip the Turkish and Saudi Arabian armies with aviation defense systems.

- The Carlyle Group also manages the financial assets of the Saudi Binladen Corporation (SBC). The SBC is headed up by members of Osama bin Laden’s family, and played a principle role in helping George W. Bush win petroleum concessions from Bahrain when he was head of the Texan oil company, Harken Energy Corporation, a deal that was to make the Bush family millions of dollars. Salem bin Laden, Osama bin Laden’s brother, was represented on Harken’s board of directors by his American agent, James R. Bath, an SBC advisor. The Carlyle Group held a meeting at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in NYC one day before the 9/11 terrorist attacks. According to the Washington Post and the CBC, in attendance at this meeting were former president George H. W. Bush and another of Osama’s brothers, Shafiq bin Laden.

- The connection between the Bush and bin Laden families can also be traced to the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in the 1990s. Members of the bank’s board of directors included Richard Helms and William Casey, business partners of George H. W. Bush and former CIA agents. During their time at the BCCI both Helms and Casey worked alongside fellow director, Adnan Khasshoggi, who also represented the bin Laden family’s interests in the US. The CIA held numerous accounts with the BCCI, these bank accounts were used for a variety of illegal covert operations, including transfers of money and weapons related to the Iran-Contra scandal, according to Time Magazine. The CIA also worked with the BCCI in arming and financing the jihadist Afghan mujahideen during the Afghan War against the Soviet Union, including Osama bin Laden (who also held an account with the BCCI) and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar (Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1993-1996). The CIA used the BCCI to launder proceeds from trafficking heroin grown in the Pakistan-Afghanistan borderlands to the mujahideen soldiers, boosting the flow of narcotics to European and US markets and arming future enemies of the United States.

I thought people would stand up for their rights when Bush v. Gore happened.

I thought people would stand up for their rights when the Patriot Act was passed.

I thought people would stand up for their rights when the GOP blatantly obstructed a sitting president for 8 years.

I thought people would stand up for their rights when Citizens United passed.

I thought people would stand up for their rights when Roe v. Wade was thrown out.

I thought people would stand up for their rights after Jan 6.

They killed the power of unions, paving the way for today's unchecked dominance of corporate power and rising inequality. This is the foundation for stagnant wages, the rise of the gig economy, and the wealth gap that defines today’s economy.

Her Big Bang and his deregulation policies for the finance industry were the largest and most significant to that point. In just five years, their policies caused speculative finance to explode globally, directly contributing to the Savings and Loan crisis, the Great Recession, and the volatile market we see today.

Their attack on welfare systems permanently ensured inequality. This is the main cause of today's problems with housing, education, and healthcare.

One of the most craven bootlickers of modern politics and the crux is that his advocacy and enabling of Trump et al are objectively harmful to LBGTQI+. Surely Graham is a 'G'. Outing is controversial, but there's a radical difference between, say, outing a 17-year-old to hostile parents and family, and outing 69-year-old gay man who pushes anti-LBGTQI+ legislation.

"Call Prompt for Representative Susan Wild

Hello, this is [Your Name], a concerned constituent.

I’m calling to ask Representative Susan Wild, as the outgoing ranking member of the House Ethics Committee, to advocate for transparency regarding the Ethics Committee’s report on former Representative Matt Gaetz.

Despite her term nearing its conclusion, her leadership in ensuring accountability and ethical oversight remains critical. I urge her to read the details of the report into the congressional record to ensure the public’s right to know is upheld.

Thank you for your time, and please let her know how much her commitment to ethical governance is appreciated.

Email to Representative Susan Wild

Subject: Request to Read Matt Gaetz Ethics Report into the Congressional Record

Dear Representative Wild,

As the ranking member of the House Ethics Committee, your steadfast dedication to accountability has been greatly valued throughout your service.

Given the ongoing public interest and the serious allegations surrounding former Representative Matt Gaetz, I respectfully urge you to read the committee’s report into the congressional record before the conclusion of your term.

This action would serve the public’s right to transparency and demonstrate that ethical standards must remain paramount in Congress.

Thank you for your leadership and commitment to integrity.

Someone like Mike Davis, who is equally gross in terms of being a threat to our democracy but not publicly known as a sex trafficker.

"I’m gonna get some downvotes here, but I disagree with AOC here. Although Gabbard is a war criminal apologist, she is in fact an anti-US getting into war politician. While Republicans were forcing Obama’s hand into getting into wars in Libya and Syria, she was a staunch opposer. She explained that, as a veteran, she first-handedly saw the human suffering from the decision of folks who would never see battle.

Given how trigger happy Trump is in showing strength through violence, as he almost started a war against Iran, Venezuela, etc., it may be a good idea to have a cabinet member to push back those urges. Especially since the Trump’s pick for DoD and Secretary of State are objectively war hawks. 

With all that said, Gabbard has less chance of being affirmed by the Senate than Child Predator Gaetz because her beliefs only appeal to the MAGA Republicans, which is less than 50% of that chamber. Thus, her selection is just for show.

To me, RFK Jr. is significantly more dangerous, as head of HHS, and it’s more plausible because having a crazed buffoon in charge of that agency will destroy it, which is what Republicans want, while putting the health and lives of millions of American at risk. Presuming that these YOLO Republicans do away with the filibuster, RFK Jr., has the chance to sneak by.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

**The Real Reason We Lost the Election and How to Win It Back: A Bold Proposal**

I’ve been thinking a lot about why we lost this election, and honestly, I think it boils down to one big, uncomfortable truth: the electorate has crossed a threshold where traditional arguments and nuanced plans don’t reach them anymore. Voters aren’t connecting with details or strategies; they’re voting based on emotion, gut feelings, and simple messages that resonate on a visceral level.

So here’s my argument: if we want to win, we need to stop campaigning like the old rules still apply. Instead of trying to sell voters on carefully crafted, detailed policies, we should make bold, emotionally powerful promises that cut through the noise. Forget the policy wonks for now—our goal should be to make the boldest, most attention-grabbing commitments that speak directly to people’s frustrations and desires.

Here’s how I think we do it:

1. **Make Bold, Norm-Breaking Promises**
   * Strip complicated ideas down to their rawest, most appealing form. We’re not selling “how” we’ll do it right now; we’re selling *why* it matters and *what* the result will be. The details can come after we win. The key is to capture attention and dominate the conversation with ideas so striking that the media and voters can’t ignore them.
   * Example 1: “The rich caused inflation by price gouging, so we’re going to tax capital gains and dividends heavily and return that money to the consumers they ripped off. Let’s make the economy work for us again.”
   * Example 2: “Back in the 1950s, America was great because we taxed the wealthy fairly. Let’s bring back those tax rates and use the revenue to give every American access to zero-interest home loans and fund millions of affordable homes.”

These promises aren’t about feasibility right now—they’re about breaking through the static and making voters feel like we’re on their side, fighting for bold change that actually addresses their pain points.

1. **Red Meat for a New Base**
   * The goal isn’t to get every voter on board with every idea. It’s to energize a base with promises so bold that they spark word-of-mouth buzz and dominate the media narrative. Let them call our plans “unworkable.” Let them say, “They can’t actually do that.” What matters is that the ideas resonate with voters who feel ignored and angry, who want to see something genuinely different.
2. **Shift the Debate**
   * By throwing out bold, unexpected ideas, we force the conversation to center on our terms. Suddenly, the opposition isn’t debating whether they’re better—they’re defending the status quo while we’re proposing bold change. Even if not every promise becomes policy, we’ll have shifted the Overton Window in our favor.

We’ve been playing defense for too long, trying to argue policy nuances to people who aren’t listening. Let’s change the game. We need to campaign like we mean it, with promises that grab people’s attention, light a fire in their gut, and make them believe again.

What do you think? Am I off base, or is this the strategy we need to start winning again?",2024_11_16,05_24_51

I understand this analogy could be stretched to describe the state of war in the past century/centuries, but at least it has been under the guise of being in the interest of nations, vs the direct whim of a few bored billionaires.

Our rights have been the only thin (if demonstrably permeable) membrane providing us any protection from being full-blown slaves of the billionaire ruling class. Watch as these rights are quickly stripped away just for us all to become playthings and fill-ins for the prospective artificial workforce they are feverishly trying to craft.

The further we go down this path, the less viable any uprising on behalf of the people becomes.

Sidenote: I seriously think these days of us poors being interconnected somewhat freely via the internet are numbered. Though we have yet to learn to make the most of this capability, believe it or not, it represents an immense potential strength on behalf of the masses to unite and gather. I know the state of the internet makes that almost sound laughable, but imagine not being able to talk to people across the world anymore.

Tulsi Gabbard represents an aggressive shift into US isolationism.  We have seen time and time again how isolationist policy does not protect the US from war and further fans the flames of it.  

The US was not insulated from WW2 and it was only a matter of time until the Axis invaded and the war was on our doorstep.


If the US steps back from ""policing the world"" then all that signals is that military conquest will be rewarded and that dictators are free to do as they want.


I am not here to pretend US interventionist policy is perfect and that we should always get involved in every conflict, but this idea that the US can just abandon its duties to its allies and its responsibility in fostering world peace is extremely naive and ignorant of history.


If the US pulls back, then the signal is ""we'll let you get away with war"" and as a result, we'll see far more war and military conquests unfold by bad actors.

"You may be right. I guess, as someone who was born in Chile, where US intervention, through its intelligence agencies, literally gave a democratic nation its most brutal dictator, I am more apprehensive. From 1973 through 1989, General Pinochet was American’s biggest ally in South America, because he was great at coordinating operations to kill suspected communists, both within Chile and around the Southern Cone. As such, the US funded his government, which kept the country economically okay, allowing him to stay in power for 17 years. Without such aid, his brutal regime would’ve fallen earlier, as it happened in Argentina and Uruguay. 

As to American safety, since the Korean War, I’m not sure if the US Interventions were really that positive. For example, the American-led coup of the of Iran’s Prime Minister in the 50s, which the we did to help our ally, Great Britain’s interests, lead to a brutal Shah rule, which stayed in Iranian’s memories forever to form a huge resentment. Once Iran had its revolution, lead by liberal secularists and conservative Islamists, the Islamists took advantage of the anti-American resentment to gain power, turning Iran onto America’s biggest enemy. Now we are in constant danger from Iran, thanks to us intervening to aid an ally. Similarly, Vietnam, we enter that whole conflict to aid the French in keeping their colony.

Heck, Iraq is a great example of our interventions such. We armed and funded Saddam against Iran, and he later used all of our help against the Kurds and Kuwait. We fought a Gulf War to defeat, Saddam, but imposed such sanctions afterwards that the people in that country became totally radicalized. After, in 2003, based on complete lies, we invaded Iraq again, creating a power vacuum. Given how radicalized the folks were there, they formed ISIS, one of the most brutal terrorist organizations in history, who have attacked countless times our close allies in Western Europe.

For me, looking at history, it’s hard to waive the pro-US interventionist flag. With all that said, I totally agree that the US should continue to support allies that are under active invasions. I support helping Ukraine against neoimperialist Russia. This is different from other interventions in that the majority of the world agrees with helping Ukraine.

Just a straight up fabrication.  

This fucking quote, which, holy shit, is laughably ignorant:  “This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia's legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine's becoming a member of NATO.""(2)  That's the equivalent of saying Czechoslovakia should have been invaded by Nazi Germany because they kept building fortifications on their border since Hitler kept threatening to invade them.  That's exactly what Putin and Russia have done, threaten and cajol the nations that comprise the former soviet union, pushing them to seek admittance into NATO.  Joining the alliance is a voluntary action by the joining country, after all.  It's not as if NATO can force nations to join.  

That alone is damning enough, no sane person with a sober, empirical perspective of the conflict would suggest that Ukraine was a threat to Russia that required an invasion.

What's weird is Harris also said she would help. She even had real, concrete plans to help middle class Americans that the media ignored and voters didn't pay any attention to.

But you're not wrong about the American electorate being dangerously uninformed. Google searches for ""did Biden drop out"" spiking on election day, nearly *four months* after he dropped out is clear evidence of that.

The problem we have is it's not only not going to get better, it's going to get *so much worse* with all the massive cuts to government they're planning, like completely nuking the Department of Education. Without federal help, those states that struggle with education are going to spiral down even more.

I've been thinking a lot about this. Some of it is media bubbles, I think. We listen to our friends, our sanctioned media and unless you work hard, it's hard to hear other perspectives -- I do a lot of that work and feel very uninformed after this election. 

I am also beginning to think our view of being ""informed"" from the PoV of the left is privileged. The democrats are educated, they earn more and have the time and skills to look more at the issues. Understanding this divide would require a complete change in strategy from how Harris and previous democrats messaged policy. Addressing people's feelings and not some tax policy that will boost their home buying potential under the right circumstances is an area Trump and the new right very much understand.

Not that we need to become them, but we can learn how to message things better for people who do not have the time, or privilege to understand how a tax credit will potentially change their life. It is only once that tax credit is in effect, will their life change.

I don't think it will get worse, actually. I think this should mobilize a left that actually goes down to the level of all people. Drop down from it's New York ivory tower and get in the mud. And that truly has a chance to reshape this country for the good. 

Most people will agree with progressive policies. Most people agree with equality. They just need to see we are on the same team and for that, we need to not be afraid to meet them where they are. We need to not dismiss the ""rural hick"" as stupid and evil.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

And back to what you were saying about Harris, they don’t care about anything she or anyone that’s a democrat, liberal, etc. has to say.  Haven’t you seen already?  These people on the right will actually vote for progressive policies at times, as long as they don’t see anything about someone on the left being behind it.

I don’t know if Gaetz slept with the girl and neither do you, unless you’re Gaetz or the underaged child. 

And absolutely doesn’t “debunk” what you’re replying to - which states that ethics investigators were told Gaetz slept with an underage girl. It doesn’t say “Gaetz slept with an underage girl” - it says “ethics investigators were told Gatez slept with an underage girl.”",2024_11_16,05_24_51

Personally if he paid a 24 year for sex I really wouldn’t care that much. I’d call him an idiot and wouldn’t give it a second thought but Gaetz doesn’t deserve to go to hell.

Once again, here's something Trump is doing that I don't understand why it's legal to do. Why is it legal to not use the FBI for background checks??

Oh, never mind. Who am I kidding? Even if it were illegal to not use the FBI for background checks, Trump simply wouldn't do it and there would be no consequences.

And as for positions that require a security clearance, Trump can just override the security clearance process:

>In addition to the confirmation process, FBI background checks are used to vet nominees for a security clearance, which an attorney general nominee is required to have to do the job.

>As president, Trump could bypass the process and order Gaetz to be granted a security clearance, as he did in his first term to grant a clearance to his son-in-law [Jared Kushner](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/01/politics/jared-kushner-security-clearance/index.html) after the approval languished amid questions about potential conflicts of interest.

"The FBI isn’t a background checking organization. If you want a security clearance or any kind for any agency, 95% of that is done by w subagency of the defense dept. The really only thing existing outside of that is the intelligence community.

And fbi, though they’re not set up for and have no expertise whatsoever in this work, they’ve still stepped up in those situations cause their reputation is more important than the competency of the work. 

That process is also unnecessarily slow and has been manipulated to slow roll or block people not for any legitimate security concern but just to mess with the transition. 

So they’re going to not do that. They’re still going to thoroughly background check people. They’re still going to only use people with existing security clearances in spots that require that. They’re just not going to ask the fbi to do something it’s not very good or efficient at doing & has messed up in the past.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

If I’m wrong, and we are living Revelation now, (More than I already acknowledged, that is) it would go a long way to explaining this asshole’s plot armor.

Having foreign connections wont disqualify you, but it'll take the screening process ALOT longer. Oh and moving around ALOT will take your investigation longer as well, especially if it's overseas.

Issue is there’s so much fighting within the party where they want to go through every little detail from A - Z and if they don’t align on something then that’s it. In 2016 we had that with Clinton and Sanders. 

This election was similar. Democrats were divided on Harris. They could agree with most of her views but one differing point and it becomes a sudden loss in votes. Meanwhile Republicans are either on Team MAGA or Team “I’ll vote anyone not Democrat”. It’s stupid but that’s what won them the election. They’re always unified. 

Until Democrats can stop fighting each other over EVERY possible point and ALL rally behind a single candidate, this is always going to be a losing battle.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Some of these blue MAGA commenter's have no imagination. It's not their fault, 40 years of neoliberal economic conservatism has destroyed most American's ability to see the possibility of a better world. Biden barely did the bare minimum in terms of redirecting economic policy to be more ""new deal era""-like, with most of his more ambitious plans being knocked down by members of his own party.

I'm sorry, if you think Kamala ran a great campaign focusing on the needs of the working class, you are demonstrablely wrong. YES, her polices would help people! YES, she did promote them to some extent (when she wasn't sucking off Liz Cheney). No, her policies were not nearly ambitious enough and were more of the same technocratic, tweak around the edges fixes we've been getting from democrats for years and years.

Shocking when the dam finally breaks, and people demand big changes, they are willing to throw caution to the wind and buy into the lies another candidate tells just because he seems like he represents big change. 

Bernie would have crushed Trump in 2016 and 2020. This election was a resounding loss for the type of politics and policies the democrats have been running since Clinton. It's time to purge these ambivalent, losing assholes from the party and create a new deal party on steroids. 

There were a number of reasons Kamala lost, but had she run an unabashedly pro-worker, pro political reform campaign she would have overcome any other reason. 

People hate on Bernie because he's right, and don't like that their preferred republican-like candidates keep eating shit. Ya, we know why. ""Blue no matter who"" types keep their heads in the sand.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

The military is supposed to defend itself against 'all threats, foreign and domestic', but they can't comment because it's 'political'?

Student loan forgiveness - blocked by Republicans

PRO Act to protect unionizing - blocked by Republicans

Meanwhile Biden enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, CHIPS act, all that created millions of jobs while being the most pro-union president we've had in decades.

But do you know what has NOT caused the Democrats to lose major elections across-the-board? Failing to go too far to the left. The only people in America who think a pure progressive agenda pushed by a self described “Democratic SOCIALIST” is a winning ticket, are Bernie, and the members of the far left.

I’m not here to debate the ACTUAL merits of progressive policies or claim that many of them are not sensible… they are. And unlike many Americans, I don’t think most people on the far left are bad people…but here is what I do KNOW TO BE TRUE - 

Americans don’t WANT anyone with the term “socialist” in their name, or any policies that Fox News could portray as such…rightly or wrongly. 

If anything, the Democrats lost, because most Americans perceive them to be further left than they actually are… So moving further left isn’t going to help!! 

The Dems lost for many reasons, but far and away the biggest is PERCEPTION….because they constantly try to be too many things to too many different camps of people.

People have been primed by everything in our social environment to believe the world is falling apart.  When you believe that, someone with a positive attitude comes off as naive or disingenuous.

All of this is bullshit however.  Social Media, right wind media, and big media in general all played their part in this but here’s the facts: things are not that bad.  American’s biggest problems are how to pay for the things that make their lives awesome.  Not even how to pay for them, how to pay for them in such a way that it allows them to build wealth.  With the least bit of awareness this is a good problem to have.

Students Loans are so expensive!  Except they’re capped at a percentage of income and let me spend my 20’s partying and networking.  Now I have a 6 figure income but still can’t afford a house!  WOW, what a sacrifice.  How about you didn’t have to start working at 12?  Or join the army, or mine coal, or pick farm vegetables, or clean latrines?

The hardest parts about living in America is that we’re all so successful that we compete too much with each other.  That’s not a problem that’s going to go away if more of us are more successful.  

Eggs are too expensive?  Maybe it’s because the Egg farmer has to eat too.  Maybe your neighbor’s got a raise last month and are able to buy afford them.  This is America, if you don’t make enough money to be instantly wealthy that’s no one’s problem but your own.

That’s not a message that Dems were willing to lead with.  They weren’t willing to go to Pennsylvania and say “F you! Move somewhere else if you want success.”  The idea that economic success can be “brought” anywhere is a myth, the market finds places to move businesses it doesn’t follow any idealism.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

I would add that when Harris embraced popular themes that would appeal to working people, that message got almost no oxygen.  Some of that is context.

In fact, she outspent the Trump campaign by around $70 million on ads about the economy.

>What was the content of these ads? Calls to end corporate price gouging, lower housing costs, cut middle-class taxes and protect Social Security and Medicare.

In fact, she outspent the Trump campaign by around $70 million on ads about the economy.

>What was the content of these ads? Calls to end corporate price gouging, lower housing costs, cut middle-class taxes and protect Social Security and Medicare. Other Harris ads accused Trump of only looking out for his billionaire pals and corporations and attacked him for enacting tax cuts that were primarily directed at the wealthiest Americans.

Politicians care about reelection the most. Biden was toxic for democrats, and even more toxic for republicans. Manchin for a while had a high approval rating killing Biden's build back better legislation efforts. He actually paid a steep price for helping pass the inflation reduction act. And Manchin was willing to go along with the Inflation Reduction Act because Biden stepped back and let Schumer work quietly with Manchin.

The campaign did everything it could to make them mad and disaffected and then it says they can be blamed, as if the party didn't knowingly, visibly hit the least powerful people over and over and take delight in doing so

But 'Never-Trumpers' aren't allowed to be blamed, even though they voted Trump anyway because they know what party butters their bread.

They see this as moving them nearer the bottom rung of the pay scale. It’s screwy logic, but it’s real - people want to feel like they’re doing better than “the other guy”. 

Better messaging is “we will give people who get paid by the hour a raise” while the people at the top who get paid by sitting on their ass watching the stock ticker will have to pay their fair share. ",2024_11_16,05_24_51

There are some exceptions here and there (Bernie, AOC, etc.). But essentially what we have now is the party that supports the rich, and the party that really, REALLY supports the rich. The Dems will never back any legislation that prioritizes the people over the wealthy.

You don’t energize the base/working class because they believe you’re just the same old politician, but the superpac donors who care about policy are discouraged.

They wanted (as indicated by the outcome of the election) someone who acknowledged what they were feeling and promised to fix it. Hell, the bar for promising to fix it wasn't even high. Voters didn't need a 50 point start to finish plan on exact steps to take. They were fine with ""concepts of a plan"" so long as they felt heard.

So, the only way to avoid your tweets/writing/images by being fed to grok the AI bot is to deactivate your twitter account? Am I reading this wrong? That's insane!",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"This isn't the victory that it seems.  IMO, Twitter has done it's job that Musk purchased it for, get Trump elected and give Musk influence over the president and government.  Even if Twitter goes bankrupt, the returns will be much more then the costs.

I think this was Musk's plan all along.   Use Twitter to gain influence over the election, and a means to gain influence over the next president.   Notice how Musk took his Right turn and purchased Twitter only after it was becoming obvious that Trump would run again and was the likely nominee.   Biden was also very unpopular as well, so a Trump victory was very possible.  
  
IMO, this was a 40 billion dollar bet to put Elon exactly in the position he is currently in right now.  Elon could care less if Twitter dies.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

As well as the obvious conflict of interest of having Elon involved in American politics at all while having full control of one of the biggest sources of speech while manipulating it to push his own viewpoints. All of that PLUS the fact he’s scraping content illegally to train AI models. 

Not sorry, but fuck Elon musk. I spent years working hard to learn how to draw and like HELL am I allowing anyone to steal my art to make money off of. They literally want to take the human soul out of art and make an infinite assembly line of AI regurgitated bullshit.

There are more specific feeds that work like subreddits. I follow a feed which is just pictures of Disney parks, a feed full of folks in the model train space, a feed full of game developers, etc.

I’m part of the batch that left this time. I’d previously been on since 2009.

The insanity was easily filterable over the past couple of years. Mute keywords, people, etc., people say “there’s right wing propaganda all over the site” and outside of ads, if you had the proper filters in place, it was still very useable. You crafted your own experience. It was a great resource for card collectors, especially non-sport card collectors.

I finally left for a number of reasons.

Blocking someone was no longer blocking them. They could still see your feed, they just couldn’t interact. It’s interesting that Apple and Google haven’t spoken out against this as it violates the T&Cs of getting listed on the App Store.

But the main reason I left is because the new Terms of Service went into effect today. This includes:

- The removal of your ability to join class action lawsuits against Twitter
- The ability of Elon and Twitter to actually sue *you* if you violate any specific terms, with disputes being handled in a specific location in North Texas with a federal judge that owns stock in Tesla
- Twitter now has a royalty free copyright to everything you post, including text and images, original artwork, etc., which are then fed to train their AI model. You could previously opt out of this, but no longer can with the new Terms of Service.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

🔺Data Scraping – X now “explicitly prohibits” any unauthorized data “crawling or scraping” in any form, for any purpose.

🔺Content Rights – You still own your content, but X can “use and sublicense” it broadly.

🔺Account Suspension – Clear reasons for suspensions, including prolonged inactivity and posing a legal risks to X.

🔺Terminology – “Tweets” are now “Posts” and “Retweets” are “Reposts” as part of X’s rebranding.

🔺Venue – Any lawsuits will be handled in Texas courts instead of California.

Interestingly, X maintains that aggregate liability shall not exceed the greater of $100 USD or the amount you paid us, if any, in the past six months for the Services giving rise to the claim.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"* Musk's Russia contacts raise national security concerns for Democratic senators
* Senators urge probe into Musk's SpaceX government contracts
* Musk denies recent talks with Putin, claims security clearance

>Reports that billionaire Elon Musk has held multiple calls with Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, should be investigated by the Pentagon and law-enforcement agencies on national-security grounds, two senior Democratic senators said in a letter seen by Reuters on Friday.

>Musk, who has been appointed to a senior government role by Republican President-elect Donald Trump, oversees billions of dollars in Pentagon and intelligence-community contracts as CEO of aerospace company SpaceX.

>Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a senior Foreign Relations Committee member, and Senate Armed Services Committee chair Jack Reed told U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Pentagon's inspector general that Musk's involvement in those SpaceX programs should be probed for potential debarment and exclusion after reports as recent as October of his conversations with Russian officials. Debarment refers to exclusion from certain contracts and privileges.  
""These relationships between a well-known U.S. adversary and Mr. Musk, a beneficiary of billions of dollars in U.S. government funding, pose serious questions regarding Mr. Musk's reliability as a government contractor and a clearance holder,"" the lawmakers said in a joint letter dated on Friday.

>Several Democratic lawmakers have publicly called for a probe into Musk's communications with Moscow since a Wall Street Journal report last month on the alleged contact, but the letter to the U.S. officials who could launch such an investigation has not been previously reported.

>The call by Shaheen and Reed for a federal probe is a longshot effort as Trump prepares to return to the White House with backing from Musk, who spent over $119 million on Trump's reelection campaign and was appointed co-head of the president-elect's forthcoming Department of Government Efficiency.

>SpaceX, Musk and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Pentagon and Justice Department did not immediately respond to similar requests.

"Hey everyone, I want to just comment on this because I know inevitably how this will be received. 

""Why bother, it's not going to do anything, we're all doomed, the law doesn't matter, democracy is over.""

And on, and on, and on.

So as we head into the trump era I want to remind you all of a few important things. 

**While you can anticipate how your opponent *may* move, you must react to how they *actually* move.**

You play the game. You make every move you can. You make the *best* move you can, because you don't know what will happen in the future. 

Donald Trump, who is of course a disastrous nightmare, nevertheless had nearly every sane person on the planet telling him he couldn't win and should drop out of the race in 2016 and then again in 2024. 

And then he won. 

You have to play the moves you can with the board as it is. 

**Surviving past scandals and trials doesn't mean you're more likely to survive future scandals and trials.**

I get it. Trump gets away with everything. Because he's lucky. Because our system doesn't like holding the wealthy accountable.

It is very easy to get into a mindset of nothing mattering. But that's not really how the world works. You don't become ""more immune"" to things over time. You have to throw everything you can at your opponent because you do not know what will stick. 

Voters - clearly - don't think like you or I. 

Do you remember ""weird?"" After 10 years of every name under the sun, ""weird"" became a HUGE source of ire to the right.

It may not make sense to you. But you try. 

And if you want to piss and moan and put your head in your hands and claim all is lost, I just don't have patience for it. 

If you're here, play the game. Learn from the past. Do better in the future. 

Or lay down and let the boots trample over you.

Every authoritarian falls sooner or later. 

Donald Trump's first presidency was a fucking disaster that resulted in most of his administration being sent to jail, and him *very nearly* being sent to jail. 

It wasn't a success. He got nothing done. He revealed a profound streak of incompetence that left him devastatingly vulnerable. 

He ran a terrible campaign in 2024. But he had a lot of help from a lot of the world's worst people like Putin and Netanyahu and China, all of whom clearly put their fingers on the scale to tip things in his direction. We all know that. 

And Democrats made a lot of missteps. 

So Trump's success isn't some kind of magic power. He is just, as he always has been, a very useful idiot for a lot of very powerful and very malevolent people. 

And sure. A lot of fucking goons are going to try and insulate him this time. But he himself is even older, even stupider, and even slower than the first time. And we know his game now. We know his plans. 

So play every move. Play until you can't. That's how everything in this world works. Life is just a series of problems you solve until you die. So do what you're made to do.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

This was the beginning of the great oppression of Israel. Forgetting the benefactor who, by the favor of God, preserved and prospered Egypt, Pharaoh decided that the Chosen People should be suppressed.

We are in a time when the nation has forgotten ""Joseph"" and his wise counsel. The benefits of a clean environment, vaccination, public education, and financial regulations are taken for granted, and not credited to those important laws and institutions. We think instead that the CDC, EPA, FDA, FEC, FTC, etc., are powerful threats.

"To speak realistically for a bit, it's a legitimate concern in this scenario that the US no longer has either the ubiquitey of medical equipment necessary for such treatment nor the domestic manufacturing to produce it, and that the most likely source of such equipment would be from a country whose imports would be heavily tariffed, making them quite expensive to obtain until production can begin here. Mechanical ventilation is the modern treatment for something like this, but I suspect that's more due to the narrow use-case of iron lungs making them impractical to hold on to ""just in case"" and the shortage of skilled personnel needed to maintain them. But intubation and mechanical respiration seem to have significantly higher rates of major complications than iron lung therapy (from what I could find. There don't appear to be many studies comparing them).

In short, there aren't really any iron lungs left to dust off. And that's gonna lead to much higher mortality rates if polio comes back. We're not prepared for this scenario because this is all so easily avoidable that this isn't a scenario we should be having in the first place.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"And this is why public understanding of science is important.

Firstly, the lead author isn't a ""medical student"", but a PhD candidate at Harvard's School of Public Health, specialising in ""Population Health Sciences concentrating in infectious disease epidemiology,"" with 36 papers listed on that site.

> that 232k number is at best an educated guess based on assumptions and incomplete data.

Yes. *That is what science is*. It is the ""guesses"" based on assumptions (justified by the scientist) and the best data they have access to, and relying *on their education*.

Those three parts - the education/training, the modelling assumptions, and the data - are what make science science.

> [the authors] even noted the limitations of [their] own research.

"*From Bloomberg News reporter Bill Allison:*  
  
Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and the Democratic National Committee spent close to $1.5 billion in their unsuccessful presidential bid, but they didn’t go into debt doing so, according to the campaign’s chief financial officer.

Conservative media outlets have reported that Harris’ unsuccessful campaign spent lavishly on events with celebrities including Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey, donations to activist groups, private jets and consultants. But neither those expenditures, nor its massive outlays for advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts, led to a budget shortfall.

“As of Election Day, there were no outstanding debts or bills overdue,” said Patrick Stauffer, chief financial officer of Harris for President. He added that “there will be no debt” when the campaign and the DNC file their next disclosures with the Federal Election Commission on Dec. 5, which cover spending from Oct. 17 through Nov. 25",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"According to the special counsel, Biden had a small number of documents with classified markings. As did Mike Pence IIRC. They were both discovered by their lawyers and handed over immediately.

Trump had boxes full of top secret documents in his bathroom and other locations in Mar A Lago. He was asked repeatedly to return them and refused.

There really is no comparison between getting a few classified papers mixed up with other work and actively stealing documents and refusing to return them.

But lets prosecute them both, let the courts pass sentence according to the severity of the crime. Right?",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"They mentioned it would have been worse to not spend it and lose.  Which is mostly true even though it’s also true it’s way too much money.  $20 billion was spent in total on the election not counting the many illegal foreign efforts and so on.  So more money always helps with seemingly no upper limit.  It would be suicide to not get as much as they can.  The real answer is to put legal spending limits on supporters of both parties, reverse Citizens United, etc.  Most other developed countries have pulled it off so it’s doable, just really difficult because billionaires have a stronger foothold in the U.S.A.

Their messages would’ve resonated with the public because they weren’t linked to this current administration.  As nice as  Kamala’s messages were, there’s no way she could get away from being attached to an unpopular incumbent president.  Outside of arrogance, I have no idea why an 81 year old Biden thought it would be a good idea to run for reelection while being so unpopular.

"I don’t think any of these niche things are what lost Democrats the election as I think inflation, immigration and anti-incumbent desire for change drove it.

But, it would be great if there is a large shakeup at the DNC and they actually figure out how to build a coalition that can just settle on the 3-5 big things all Democrats everywhere agree on and then get us all to be okay with different types of democrats existing in different places in the country and in life and disagreeing on certain other issues. To me, that’s the only way this can work.

Also, I hope there is some investment from liberal billionaires into liberal and left wing media to help amplify a message and engage like minded people the way the right does. There should be conferences traveling around the country all year with speakers and panels etc the way republicans do it. You should go on YouTube or social media and follow some of the people making content for the left. A lot of them have gotten quite good.

And finally, I think we need more than just Pete Buttigieg going to where the right is and getting our message in their ears out of our own mouths.

"I think the main problem Democrats have is not knowing the average voter. By this I don’t mean,  progressives vs moderate republicans. I mean coming to the realization that over half of American adults (54%) read below a sixth-grade level and almost 1 in 5 adults reads below a third-grade level. This is the lowest common denominator. These people can barely read. They don’t understand complex policy. They don’t know basic economic concepts. They don’t know history. They can barely read and so they don’t. This is who Democrats have to reach to win elections. 

Pick a few talking points and repeat them ad nauseam until they stick. This is how Republicans reach their base. This is how foreign powers successfully influence the American electorate. This is why Bernie Sanders was so popular (wealth and income inequality, wealth and income inequality, wealth and income inequality…). This is also why people claim Harris’s campaign was all identity politics and no actual policies. 

It’s a painful realization but everyone else is doing it and it works for them... Dumb it down and make it short. If it’s in video format, so people don’t have to read, the better. Memefy it. Tragically, that’s where we’re at.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Sure, maybe that was part of it, but lets not forget disinformation, misinformation, targeted ads, and a complicit media (owned by the extreme wealthy) that had a vested interest in holding one candidate to a completely different standard.   


 The media effectively shoved Biden away and then offered little to no pushback on any of the ridiculous things Trump stated.  Easily debunked lies and crickets from the media...  Then when dems pivoted to Harris, the media ripped them for that too...  Trump offered no plans on how they will pay for mass deportation.  Selling access to the highest bidder.  His base somehow thinks hes not one of the elites out there while the Bezos' and Musks of the world rub elbows and even get cabinet positions.   But sure lets call it a broken system... 


 Id argue the most broken thing is the media as it seems we are at the entertainment>news side of things.  The fox propaganda is disgusting and now podcasts and youtube apparently are 100% fact because if its on the internet it must be true...

"1. This has got to be the end of the DLC/Triangulation political ideology of tacking to the middle.  It has reached the limit of its efficacy
2. Democrats rolled the dice on high propensity voters (who have moderate politics) over lower propensity voters and in a General Election with Trump on the ticket, it cost them dearly.  I have no doubts this kind of strategy could still work in midterm elections or special elections, but the evidence suggests that in a General Election you have to drive turnout among your base of voters.
3. Biden really screwed the entire country with his hubris.  I worried when he was picked as the nominee in 2020 that he would be [America's Hindenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Hindenburg).  4 years ago I would have taken the L gladly, but now its looking more like a perfect fit.

Later, I received another email saying we were not going to be receiving the relief that the government promised. It wasn’t a surprise but it was a blow. 

I understand the reasons why my loan forgiveness failed to arrive and I understand even why some folks think student loan forgiveness shouldn’t happen (I understand, even though I have been happily paying for your home and child tax breaks that I haven’t been personally benefiting from…assholes). But it’s pretty shocking to have your government go back on its word. 

I wouldn’t ever do something as stupid as vote for Donald Trump of all people to burn it down, but I kind of see why people would want to burn it down.

"I read the article. It fails to understand how bills become a law (D’s would need a trifecta to enact meaningful legislation). Zero of the authors ideas about what Democrats could do are any good. 

The argument the author is making when applied just to the institution of the Democratic Party itself, however, starts to get closer to the lesson the Party needs to learn.

The PARTY needs to be bold. It is a weak, slow and scared party. And that just cannot be successfully sold to the electorate. 

R’s are never going to buy it, obviously. But swing voters aren’t compelled by it, and a pretty big percentage of D constituents are repulsed by it. 

So after turning off 2/3rds of the country… there’s not much winning that can be bad for the Democratic Party.

The Party apparatus needs to be gutted and restored. 

The Party needs leadership that is bold. Isn’t afraid to say the truth, and to say it plainly. Stop the equivocating. 

The Party needs leadership that can speak extemporaneously and authentically. Not in focus group crafted nothing-speak. 

Maybe our bills don’t get passed, but we need to talk about bills we are shooting for that deliver basic, non-wonky, tangible reforms that make differences in regular people’s lives. (Like FDR did, like LBJ did). 

We need real, genuine, talented leadership at the D party headquarters. Not what we have now with this insider network of well-connected, corporatist white-collar-class cronies.

I'm not even saying it'd have been a viable strategy (pragmatically) for Kamala to approach the issue differently. But the fact that it was happening certainly had a cultural impact. Gaza didn't have to be an explicit reason. Kamala continued Biden's approach of saying you should do all you can to stop Trump, that is, vote for Kamala: if you don't, you're a terrible person, you should be ashamed. No one knew if that'd work. For a long time, it seemed like it would. Culturally, emotionally, especially with young people, Gaza made things less clear-cut. Think of it more like a cultural environment than actual logical reasoning: ""Maybe it's not the worst of sins not to go vote today, not to be super excited about Kamala.

Inflation has not come down, the rate of growth in inflation has come down.  Since 2021 to today, prices have increased almost 19% and housing is even more.  The Democrats are living in a college-educated echo chamber.  They do not understand that most Americans live paycheck to paycheck and don't even have $500 in case of emergencies.  Higher earners can afford to be worried about issues like abortion and fascism, most Americans only care about putting food on the damned table or getting clothes for their kids.  Those are the facts.  I voted for Harris but knew Trump would win.  Biden would have lost as well.  Prices are too high, and letting 3.25 million immigrants illegally enter the country was monumentally stupid.  We can talk about humanitarian reasons until we're blue in the face.

"I think we had a collective blind spot on interest rates.  We understand how important they were in bringing down interest rates but underestimated how hard they were punishing normal people. 

In hindsight it should be obvious, the number one political rule is - don't fuck with homeowners.

Take an average home of 500k.  A few years ago with mortgage rates at 3% the payment was $2100.  With interest rates at 8% the payment becomes $3700.  That same home could have inflated to $900k and STILL be more affordable than the 500k home under Biden's interest rates (yes I know he doesn't set them but idiots don't).

Payments are what put homeownership out of reach, the absolute cost has no real bearing on affordability.

What we needed to fix the housing market is very cheap mortgages for primary residences and very expensive mortgages and loans for rental/landlord properties.  Instead current homeowners got to see the value of their home stop growing or even go down which feels bad, and prospective homeowners saw interest rates increase so that those cheaper homes were even more unaffordable which feels bad, and people who had no choice but to buy/sell for life and relocation reasons were forced into absolutely usurious loans with $2000+ a month in interest which feels bad.

"Anyone who cares about identity politics and **doesn't** care about economic justice and economic populism is not actually a leftist. No one who supports the current economic status quo is actually leftist, period.

The establishment's problem has absolutely nothing to do with woke shit. That was not what decided this election whatsoever.

America's social fabric is falling apart, neoliberalism has gutted the working and middle class, and people are absolutely desperate for a change to the status quo. Bernie's rhetoric is the simple truth of the matter. Nothing can fix America's problems except for significant tax increases on the ultra rich and corporations (and minor tax increases on everyone else) in order to fund real social programs. Programs that can allow everyone to live happy, functional, healthy, and stable lives even with low income jobs. 

Universal healthcare. A year of parental leave when you have a new baby. Federal minimum of 4 weeks of vacation a year. Increased worker protections. Everyone could have those things and life would be better for everyone.

They need to go out there and actually say these words out loud, ""The ultra rich apply tremendous pressure to everyone in the political establishment to ensure that the real reform which is necessary to improve your lives cannot happen."" And then they need to take action.

Trump's second term is truly the ultimate repudiation of the Democratic party's service to Wall Street and the ultrarich. Not because the Republicans do any different, but because people have gotten *so fucking desperate* that they'd rather burn the system down than let it keep going. That is the ultimate example of a failure of governance. Trump just acknowledges that there are profound problems while lying about the cause and the solution. Kamala says, ""Things are tough but we've made good progress and we'll keep going."" Then she throws a bone to anyone already in the position to buy a home or start a business. You know who that isn't? The people who are suffering the most. 

Trump only won because the Dems cannot actually say out loud that (for example) universal healthcare is the clearly superior healthcare system, it's cheaper and it frees you from being tied to your employer's healthcare. That it's time to tax the ultrarich to give everyone healthcare that is free at point of service - with a promise that people's insurance premiums will not go up when they transition to whatever universal system ends up being used.

America is extremely politically polarized, and voting isn't mandatory. This means that voting isn't about America ""choosing"" one candidate or the other. Everyone knows who Trump is, and everyone knows which side they supported long before election season.

Voting in the US should be looked at as two separate events. There is very little overlap between the supporters of each party.

Republicans speak to Republicans, and, if their message appeals to their supporters, those supporters will turn out to vote for them.

The same usually applies to Democrats. Voters didn't just become stupid this year, that's always true, that's not what changed.

This year, the Democrats were in conflict with a large chunk of Democratic voters over their support of genocide in Gaza. Instead of changing their support for Gaza to appeal to their supporters, the Democrats tried to speak to ""moderate"" Republicans.

I was a homebuilder in a state struggling with rapidly increasing housing costs. Everything we built was a 4+ bedroom, 2.5 bath monstrosities in upper middle class sprawl neighborhoods valued at 2-3 times the local cost of housing. They'd sit empty for a while, then finally someone would buy into their inflationary balloon mortgages and buy one. The smaller starter home they left got scooped up by landlords or investment firms. The result was a net loss for new home buyers looking to enter the market. 

We needed to build 4 houses on average to create one new homeowner.

What we need is rezoning to allow for the building of smaller, starter homes and incentives for builders to actually build them. We need restructuring of tax laws that restricts investment firms from buying residential properties, and to increase taxes on vacant property. We also need to outlaw property valuing algorithms like RealPage which artificially inflate housing and rental costs.

"> A woman who claims she had sex with former Florida congressman—and current attorney general nominee—Matt Gaetz while she was a minor testified about the encounter in front of the House Ethics Committee, ABC News reported Thursday. The network cited sources familiar with the Justice Department investigation into Gaetz, which ultimately resulted in no charges against the Republican firebrand. He has continually denied all charges of impropriety. The news comes just as the committee was scheduled to meet to consider releasing a report on its findings this week. Since Gaetz is no longer in Congress, however, its release is up in the air. The lawyer for the woman who testified, John Clune, has called on the committee to make it public, saying of his client: “She was a high school student and there were witnesses.” Gaetz said following Thursday’s report that the “allegations are invented and would constitute false testimony to Congress.” He added: “This false smear following a three-year criminal investigation should be viewed with great skepticism.”

Of course Gaetz denies, but it seems weak given:

> The Justice Department investigation did result in an 11-year prison sentence for a former friend of Gaetz’s, Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg, who pleaded guilty to sex trafficking of the woman when she was under 18.

So someone already got an 11 year sentence for trafficking this woman, but Gaetz claims there is no merit.

It would be figuratively criminal if they don't release the report. She should file a FOIA for the report because she will need to cite it when Republican media harasses her and she has to sue them for defamation.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Text to avoid using that billionaire’s site: 

The roommate indeed shared an apartment with Gaetz at the time and died while occupying that apartment, according to records obtained from Leon and Duval counties.

The rumors of asphyxiation started after Burnett was discovered not in his apartment in Tallahassee, but in another location in Jacksonville. However, asphyxiation has not been established as a definitive cause of death, and attempts to retrieve a death certificate listing cause of death were not successful. Burnett could have died from drug or alcohol overdose, or any number of ailments. The exact details of his death remain unknown.

Burnett’s widow refuses to speak publicly about what happened to her then-husband, even more than 20 years later. 

However, a source who was with Don Gaetz when he received a panicked call from the younger Gaetz on the day Burnett died overheard the conversation between a panicked son and his angry father.

The source stated he was present as the elder Gaetz put in calls to both the Leon and Duval sheriff's departments and made arrangements to move the body and conceal the cause of the death. Another source was party to the payments made to buy silence from those with knowledge of what happened.

The wife of another prominent Florida politician mysteriously died the day before she was meant to speak with the FBI regarding the Gaetz family, according to a close relative of the woman and public records reviewed for this story. 

Lori Weems Evers died April 22, 2022, and the cause of her death is still unknown. Family were kept in the dark for days after her death, and the FBI did not realize she died until informed by a family friend a week later. 

Evers’ husband died years earlier after his car was driven off a bridge. The 2017 death was ruled an accident with papers reporting Greg Evers fell asleep at the wheel, hit a guardrail, and plunged into a creek near his house. 

But the damage to the vehicle could not have been caused by hitting a guardrail laterally, a family member claims. The car had been hit and pushed into the river. Evers’ family and close friends believe he was murdered by Don Gaetz.

The secrecy and subsequent cover-up of Burnett’s death will be covered by a reporter with whom I’ve shared information and had previously worked on this story before being attacked and even doxxed by Matt Gaetz two years ago.

The deaths of Lori and Greg Evers - a couple as powerful as Don Gaetz with information they each claimed could destroy father and son both - are open and closed cases, respectively. 

Gaetz remains the target of an ongoing sex trafficking investigation in which his accomplice, Joel Greenberg, is currently serving a lengthy prison sentence for. Greenberg pled guilty to trafficking a minor child with Matt Gaetz, and payments from Gaetz to Greenburg were used to pay the minor for sex, according to Greenberg’s testimony. 

The incident Greenberg references in his testimony is hardly the only time Gaetz paid for sex or had sex with teens, according to current and former staffers. 

Joel Greenberg gave officials evidence that Matt Gaetz was not only involved in the sex trafficking activity for which Greenberg pled guilty, but also that Gaetz had a hand in the 2020 Ghost Candidate scheme, fraudulent real estate deals, and misuse of COVID-19 funding.

[Note: One of the individuals recently named in the 2020 Ghost Candidate scheme also represented a sham candidate who ran against Gaetz’ opponent in 2022 and unsuccessfully attempted to have her disqualified from the ballot.]

Gaetz eloped to California during COVID-19, which he railed for being “locked down” due to protocol measures, to marry a woman 12 years younger than him at the height of the negative press regarding grand jury testimony in the ongoing sex trafficking allegations levied against him.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"In case you've memory holed Trump's dangerous behavior and rhetoric, which many low-propensity voters did this last election. Or you're dismissing the magnitude of his provocations, which the media and general public have been doing throughout this election cycle, let me remind you that the ""fearmongering"" and unconstitutional threats are coming disproportionately from Trump and his MAGA coalition.

While Trump cries about Democrats ""weaponizing the justice system against him,"" he has the gall to threaten to do the same to all those who have either spoken out against him, those who have challenged or criticized him, who have literally risked their necks to warn the American public about him, those who ""stole the election"" from him, and those who have tried to hold him accountable.

He is a perpetual victim who cries ""persecution!"" whenever there's the remote chance that someone will hold him responsible for his crimes or misconduct. This is a person so delusional and entitled that he likens himself to Nelson Mandela, MLK, Abraham Lincoln, Jesus Christ ffs! A person who has spent his entire life gaming the justice system while desperately avoiding incrimination. Yet, he takes pleasure in knowing that he's just a couple of months away from having the power to go on an all out vengeance spree.

Trump has been the most divisive political figure in recent memory, and not only did he play a primary role in facilitating January 6th, but his lies, his dangerous anti-democratic rhetoric, his constant fearmongering and his emotional tirades on Truth Social have solidified a movement of deranged fanatics willing to go to any length to protect *their* country from all of the big bad boogeymen that Trump and his allies incessantly warn us about.

Trump has always appealed to the worst impulses of his supporters, their hate, their fears, their victimhood, their phobias and paranoid delusions. He is a beacon for white supremacist and violent, far right extremist groups.

There are countless remarks to choose from, many of them unconstitutional, that Trump has made against his opponents, whether on the ticket, in the media, or all around us. Enemies who are constantly scheming to undermine him, rig elections or assassinate him, plotting to weaponize every system of justice against him, to spread ""fake news,"" to relentlessly persecute him and his followers.

He has convinced millions of his supporters that violence is a first and last resort against a radical leftist monolith and monster of his own making.

Laurence W. Britt published *""Fascism Anyone?""*, which included a list of 14 defining characteristics of fascist. This list has become widely shared and circulated:

- ""Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism""
- ""Disdain for the importance of human rights""
- ""Identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause""
- ""The supremacy of the military/avid militarism""
- ""Rampant sexism""
- ""A controlled mass media""
- ""Obsession with national security""
- ""Religion and ruling elite tied together""
- ""Power of corporations protected""
- ""Power of labor suppressed or eliminated""
- ""Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts""
- ""Obsession with crime and punishment""
- ""Rampant cronyism and corruption""
- ""Fraudulent elections""

I dunno about you, but I found that Trumpism covers almost all the bases here.

One problem that exists however, is that the term itself has kind of lost some of its meaning recently. As a result, Trump supporters will simply roll their eyes whenever they hear the accusation, while simultaneously being on board with many of the... pre requisites mentioned above

One thing they'll argue is, ""how come Trump wasn't a fascist during his first term huh!? Checkmate libs!""

But he tried, and your memory-holing of his presidency, of his efforts to overturn the election, his promotion of election denying misinformation, of his incendiary and xenophobic rhetoric, of his authoritarian whims, his many attempts to obstruct justice, his unconstitutional provocations, his appeal to white supremacist groups, his incitement of violence against marginalized people, and his overtly bigoted, ultra nationalistic, nativist, highly divisive, insular and intolerant language doesn't change that.

Not only that, but during Trump's last presidency, he had people around him, people who acted as guardrails against his worst impulses and instincts, and this time around, Trump has and will surround himself with capitulating loyalists who won't act as checks against his autocratic and fascist whims, instead, they'll be there to enable him, embolden him, use him.

While at the same time, according to some of Trump's sycophants, we are not supposed to take this stuff seriously, Trump just ""exaggerates"" sometimes, admitting of course, that Donald Trump isn't a serious candidate.

Trump's absurdity magically renders him benign? Is that what you're saying? We're just supposed to look the other way, and not take him at his word? All his recent threats and his dangerous, anti-democratic proposals are just jokes?

Some of his followers will literally tell us that he doesn't actually mean what he says... That we shouldn't listen to the things he's saying, or he's really just saying something else entirely, which is a load of BS.

These people will continue to rationalize and defend him to no end. Minimizing and downplaying his threats and rhetoric, but when he becomes president, these same people will show us that they were behind him all along.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Just going to reiterate my point as I generally agree with most of what you said. Doesn't change my opinion on the matter. Trump won't be the first or last leader to use a government entity to squash protest. Happened under Biden. Happened under trump. Happened under Obama. Etc. 


The positive of trump doing it is people like you (people with heavy bias towards one side) come out and start saying it's a problem under trump so MAYBE some change can be enacted within our government to set precedence for future leaders by attacking trump on this front. 


And I think it's totally fearmongering and or conformation bias that being said two things can be true at the same time it does lightly spread awesrness and bring attention to an issue but that doesn't mean the other two aren't true because they totally apply with some people. And again this is over something many leaders have had the power to do and have used it.

">“Matt Gaetz is a sex trafficking drug addicted piece of shit,” wrote Ben Domenech in a Substack post titled, “Matt Gaetz is a Vile Sex Pest and Any Senator Who Votes For Him Owns That.”

>“He is abhorrent,” Domenech said of Gaetz. “His eyes are permanently rimmed with the red rings of chemical boosters. In person, he smells like overexposed Axe Body Spray and stale Astroglide.”

Just a bit from the piece.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"The whole paragraph describing him is worth the read


“I realize that we are occasionally given to hyperbole about the untoward nature of politicians, but let me be clear: Matt Gaetz is a sex trafficking drug addicted piece of shit. He is abhorrent. His eyes are permanently rimmed with the red rings of chemical boosters. In person, he smells like overexposed Axe Body Spray and stale Astroglide. The fact that he boasted on the floor to multiple colleagues in the House of Representatives of his methods of crushing Viagra and high test Red Bull to maintain his erection through his orgiastic evenings is perhaps the least offensive of his many crimes against womanhood and Christian faith. The man has less principles than your average fentanyl addicted hobo. He likes them underage and he’s not ashamed about it. Matt Gaetz isn’t just your average extreme Florida MAGA Man, he’s a hypocritical ass with the worst Botox money can buy, pursuing an ever-thinner nose and higher cheekbones at every opportunity like a Real Housewife gone mad for fillers. Every Republican in Washington has an opinion about Matt Gaetz, and 99 percent of those opinions are “Keep Matt Gaetz away from my wife/daughter/friend and anyone I care about.” He is a walking genital, warts included as a bonus. If I was merely attempting to count the number of women I know who have had bad experiences with Matt Gaetz, I would run out of fingers and toes. If you vote for him to be the Attorney General of the United States, you don’t just need your head examined, you need to be committed to a mental institution. The man is absolutely vile. There are pools of vomit with more to offer the earth than this STD-riddled testament to the failure of fallen masculinity.”",2024_11_16,05_24_51

> The comments marked a stunning reversal for Johnson, who just Thursday told Fox News that the speaker’s role is not to get “involved in what happens in Ethics. Lots of important reasons for that.”

">Do you work for the mainstream media?

No, I don’t work for Fox News.

Put words in your mouth? You said “they should be scared” under a story about the federal workforce as a whole being scared.

No specifics like you’re trying to do here. Just “they.” That’s 100% of them. How else am I supposed to interpret it? 

You said you don’t want them fired, but *that’s* what they’re scared about. So if they all SHOULD be scared, I’m supposed to assume that you meant you want them to be motivated to work hard and do their best? Come on. No one says “they should be scared” as a means of encouragement. You 100% intended it to mean, “they should be scared because they ARE going to be fired.” And you’re happy about it. 

All your descriptors here make it inordinately clear you know jack shit about Federal employees and what they do. The difference between your vision of them and reality is vast. 

“Entrenched”

Give me a fucking break. They’re just fucking *people* dude. Working a fucking job. Typing and processing and doing IT shit. Inspectors. Engineers. Admin. Accountants. Just like anywhere else. You’d never call an analyst who worked at their firm for 20 years “entrenched,” with the sort of disdain you clearly have. But if they work for the fed, it’s different to you. It doesn’t make sense. 

No dude. Fed employees—They just do the work. Dem in office. Repub in office. Doesn’t matter. They change the photo of the president and secretary in the lobby and they keep on doing their jobs. That’s it. There’s no big ring of pencil pushers not sending emails or pouring acid on hard drives or whatever it is you think they’re doing. They send the memos, sign the reports, check the boxes and go home to their kids.

* Their idea of sex education: none. And also get married right after high school and never use contraception so you can start pumping out babies as early as possible.
* Their idea of literature: carefully selected bible texts and religious propaganda.
* They want to promote the isolation and open harassment of LGBTQ kids.

Is it that schools occasionally had regulations that specified it's not the teachers' business to tell parents about their children's sexual preferences, should they ""come out""?

When I was a kid in the 90s/early 2000s, we had Sex Ed where they told us every detail of the menstrual cycle, of the specifics of how intercourse works and sperm interacts with eggs, and even the ol' ""correct condom use"" banana thing.

CRT, ""transgender insanity"", and vague ideas about sexual content being foisted on our children through public education are not mainstream things that are happening, but are presented this way because if you can make people outraged about public education, they become amenable to the idea of privatization (sold as ""choice""/""parent's rights"") which is the real goal so they can profit from it more directly and control information.

Don't take my word for it. [Listen to conservative activist Christopher Rufo](https://i.imgur.com/G2MWZKI.png) who helped make CRT a national issue:

>  We have successfully frozen their brand--""critical race theory""--into the public conversation and are steadily driving up negative perceptions. We will eventually turn it toxic, as we put all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category.
 The goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think ""critical race theory."" We have decodified the term and will recodify it to annex the entire range of cultural constructions that are unpopular with Americans.

"Honestly, this is just another BS talking point of his. From what Ive read most school districts across the country on average get around 10% of their funding from the federal level. Most of them get the bulk of their funding from local taxes. I dont think this would be enough to “end wokeness.” Most schools also get their curriculum directly from their local school board or state board of education. Not the federal government. 

Id be more worried about them adjusting title IX protections in some way and/or changing the landscape of student loans in a negative way. 

As far as abolishing the department goes. Idk. The Republicans have had people stating they want to since its inception and have not done it with larger majorities in Congress than now.

"In this context, 'Wokeness' is roughly defined as the emphasis on political correctness to an excessive degree, prioritization of identity politics, and promotion of activism that is divisive or detrimental to traditional values and free expression. 

Big concerns with 'wokeness' are an overreach of social justice initiatives designed to regulate language, behavior, and thoughts themselves to an unnecessary degree. A culture that fosters dependency over resilience through systems designed to encourage individuals to view themselves as victims of an oppressive society. The enforcement of excessive 'public shaming', de-platforming and ostracism to those with dissenting or controversial views.  The compromising of merit-based systems in favor of ones focused on identity. A cultural fragmentation that emphasizes differences on gender, race and sexual identity over shared values and national identity, creating greater polarization in society. 

At the end of the day, 'wokeness' is a perceived dogmatic ideological framework that is a threat to fracture society.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"A woman is a title provided by those that lean heavily on the feminine side of societal norms. A female is an organism type that has the reproductive organs necessary to give birth.

Anyway the idea of ending ‘wokeness’ is a blanket white supremacy term to cover up the 200 years of indigenous genocide, slavery, government funded war crimes against the public such as the tulsa race massacre, battle of blair mountain, etc. 

I find that undereducated white united americans take it to heart that the foregoers of this country who share the same skin tone committed such atrocities. It’s a shame because they have no business taking it to heart since they are not the ones who committed said acts. The system is simply trying to teach them what happened so that it can be avoid and we have our hindsight moment that things are much better now then they were before. Well not so much now.

We don't care if you say we came from a shithole - we *know* we came from a shithole, which is why we're in the US now.

We don't care if we have to work hard - we already work much harder than you, and for less money.

We don't care about your shitty grants for people who look like us - we're not about to go to college just because it's a little cheaper, so that when we leave, we return right back to working harder than you but now with debt.

All we want is to earn our daily bread and let us feel like we run the family. Leave us alone and we'll deal with the rest.

Trump promises what was already traditional Hispanic culture, but without the corrupt authoritarian economy that we left behind. That's precisely what we the trad Hispanic have always wanted, and most Hispanic countries except perhaps Spain itself (which has been influenced by a delicious mix of militant trade unionism, European liberalism, a fascist dictator who chose pragmatism, and contempt for the Church that became said dictator's lackey) are full of us.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

Filing taxes, writing resumes, financial fundamentals (cars, property, credit cards, debt, etc), insurance, and even navigating the legal system. There are also some skill such as basic cooking, first aide, and computer classes that are usually optional classes.

Unfortunately, the argument of pushing the responsibility off to the parents is not valid option. Not everyone has parents who know how to do those things, especially second generation Americans that end up learning at lot of things on their own.

"Using armies from different regions is a classic dictator move. I learned this from a guy who used to be on the radio hosting a show called Dark Secret Place. He’s a combat vet and always had these history lessons about how dictators control things in other countries. 

He often spoke about how China’s crackdown on Tiananmen failed because they used soldiers from the region to quash the protests. Soldiers saw people they knew and didn’t want to just quash friends and family with tanks. They went to a different military district and bussed them in and those soldiers crushed the protests. 

So when I hear Trump wants to bring in Texas soldiers to California I know it’s because he doesn’t want those soldiers to have issues with things like shooting protesters in the legs or demolishing grandma’s home.

"Gender studies, from my experience, is not taught in the k-12 system. I’m not sure if health and sex ed courses have expanded since I was last in school, but I can’t see any reason to not teach students about LGBT+ topics if we are still going off the main goal of preparing people for the adult world. We can’t pretend that gay and trans people don’t exist, they could very well be a boss, coworker, friend, family, or even a teacher- so providing a breakdown of those topics in an unbiased environment that doesn’t tolerate hate sounds like a pretty sound idea.

As far as racism and this idea that we are gearing students to hate cis white men: The only way that even comes close to happening in our school comes down to teaching history. We primarily focus on American history in our schools, so there is a LOT of discussion on slavery, segregation, women’s suffrage, and other act of oppression. Now it’s obvious to see how this can potentially paint a picture of ‘white man bad’, but the alternative of excluding those courses seems a sure fire way to keep oppressed groups… oppressed.

One thing to consider is that I don't actually pay may taxes or provide the money to the federal government. My employer does because their system is all set up to do it for me automatically. The only task that I do is make sure that everything matches and either I get a refund or have to pay more.

It’s individual taxpayers and employers and others with withholding obligations. Sure, individual people could become tax protestors and refuse to pay. But that’s never going to be more than a small percentage of people. So how is California, as a whole, going to stop paying?

I completely agree that the Democratic Party and its surrogates have completely lost all vision, credibility, impetus, etc. I have been saying that for years. But the practicality of a “financial civil war” makes no sense. It is one thing for the federal government, a centralized entity, to withhold funding. It is quite another for a mass of individual taxpayers in a state to just stop paying.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"I'm not sure that Democrats becoming more willing to be unethical while selectively ignoring the Constitution and abusing the ridiculous amount of power SCOTUS has unlawfully given to the executive branch is going to work out like you think. 

The problem with any ""the ends justify the means"" approach is that power shifts hands every 4-8 years on average, by design, and any precedents set by getting creative with executive authority or states rights can be used by bad actors future administrations. If Democrats were to go that route it would be smarter for them to do so while Biden is still in office because as of now the sitting President has almost unlimited executive authority. However, we should be limiting executive authority not attempting to expand it even further. Now, Democrats will likely take over the role of obstructionist party, but I doubt they will do shit like play chicken with shutting down government spending. I do not agree with obstructionism in principle because a functioning democratic republic requires cooperation and compromise to get anything of note accomplished. So as party policy I think it's moronic and damaging, but especially with some of the crazier shit that Trump said he was going to do they don't have much of a choice in the short term. 

I do agree that Democrats need to change their strategy, but it has so much more to do with messaging and campaigning. Democrats need to stop focusing on cultural issues especially whilst campaigning and instead shifting focus almost exclusively to improving the lives of the working class. Many of those cultural issues are comparatively minor and can be addressed without much attention with executive orders and federal guidelines. I would much rather them focus on improving public education (raise teacher pay drastically to address shortages, get rid of standardized testing completely and fund all public schools equally with adjustments made per capita), shift from the completely disastrous enforcement approach to a public health approach to address the drug epidemic, campaign finance reform and blocking members of Congress from trading in attempt to restore at least some measure of public trust. Issues that everyone agrees need addressing so it doesn't take much political capital and if properly addressed would noticeably benefit the lives of average working class citizens. All of those suggestions have proven templates for success so they will work and in most cases save taxpayer money. Healthcare could be included in that, but ""socialized medicine"" would cost tremendous political capital even though it would actually be cheaper than our current system and end up drastically driving down the cost of prescription drugs. That would be another example of an issue we could address with a proven template for success though.

The Democratic Party needs to rebrand itself as the party of pragmatism and the working class. Now, I have a ton of issues with our government that both sides abuse many of which are related to corporate/special interest money in politics ensuring that our representatives are beholden to them instead of the people they were elected to represent and the lack of pragmatism/cooperation in addressing issues plaguing the working class that don't cost much political capital like the ones I mentioned above. We can't keep going down this road of divisiveness and obstructionism... We just can't. Nothing of substance will ever get done because things like federal guidelines and executive orders will just be reversed by the ""opposition"". Americans have to drop this Us vs. Them mentality in our political discourse and the working class needs to stop myopically focusing on culture war issues so we at least have a chance to unite and force corporate money out of the political process because until we do that both major parties will remain beholden to special interests and their corporate overlords instead of their constituents. Until that happens any progress made will be temporary at best and easily reversed by SCOTUS and/or the executive branch. That's a longer term goal unfortunately with Trump in office and multiple billionaires in his administration. I don't understand why people are politically supportive of billionaires, it makes no sense to me. Kamala Harris took a ton of money from billionaires this election cycle as well which bothered me, but I highly doubt she would be putting them in her cabinet as a result. It's pretty blatant corruption and cronyism, but our laws/court rulings currently allow it. I mean if anyone doubted we have a two tier justice system the past few years have rendered that argument moot. It's so clearly obvious that the obscenely wealthy are borderline untouchable unless they fuck over other billionaires and even then white collar crime results in a slap on the wrist in the rare cases they are actually prosecuted. If you struggle with addiction they'll trap you in the system for life, but manipulating markets and lying to investors and stealing millions from pensions gets you a fine that is so insignificant it's viewed as a cost of doing business. And it sure seems like most of the time they don't even attempt to convene a grand jury unless/until media coverage and public pressure forces them to act.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

(Likewise, “red” counties also have lots of “blue” folks.) A general strike in California is effectively impossible given those divisions.

When Obama was trying to use recess appointments because Mitch McConnell had slowed down or stopped the approval process for dozens of personnel the Supreme Court ruled that a ""recess"" must be more than 10 days... but there was also a unanimous consent that the President had the power to force an adjournment/recess.

No President has ever done it though.

"Hard to be sure since it hasn't been tested but it seems pretty clear it requires a disagreement between the house and the senate. so if the house and senate leadership work together, they could prevent trump from adjourning them.  it looks to me like a forced adjournment would basically be helpful if

A) the republicans in the house are fully on board with a nomination but the senate republicans are not. in this case the house could force a disagreement that gives trump the power to adjourn both, and then appoint whoever it it that he wants. in a way, this gives the house a backdoor capability to approve nominations that the senate will not (even though the senate is constitutionally mandated to advice and consent and the house is constitutionally uninvolved... i suspect current scotus would approve this for an R but not for a D president)

B) the senate majority Rs want to approve a nomination but the senate minority Ds are filibustering it. they could use the adjournment to get around it but TBH I think it's more likely that if they want it that bad they'd just remove the filibuster instead.

Kennedy Jr. was nominated to the role that could see him take charge of America's public health agencies on Thursday night, two months after he dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Trump.

"Again, I would recommend reading his books or properly listening to his long form discussions if you want to understand his *actual* views, along with the evidence supporting them. But I suppose the purpose of cherry-picked, out-of-context soundbites and/or mischaracterizations of his views being spouted invectively on mainstream media is exactly to prevent people from wanting to investigate on their own… well done mainstream media.

I firmly believe that it is disingenuous to write someone off as a crank without *earnestly* and *generously* investigating their ideas. I make it a point to read and generously interpret everything I can directly from the source, *especially* if I think I disagree with it or think it is unfounded. Then I can come to my own conclusions with information from all angles. How else would I come to understand or appropriately argue for or against anything?

RFK’s primary hypothesis is that the unprecedented rise in many chronic illnesses we see today is likely at least influenced by the many novel foods, drugs, and other environmental factors that we expose ourselves to relentlessly in this hyper-modern world, and that we need some restructuring of industry regulation to properly and transparently investigate this hypothesis (rather than rely on big food or big pharma to fund studies that will ultimately lose them money, which they obviously have no incentive to do). This isn’t exactly a hot take, imo. Lukewarm, really.

Most “conspiracy theories” that are attributed to RFK are just mischaracterizations of this primary hypothesis applied to specific instances and framed in the most inflammatory way possible (with *at least* the vaccine, ivermectin, 5g, and fluoride points you made above being very good examples of this), which is not a good recipe for reasoned discussion imo. I believe that if most people just listened to his ideas earnestly without the preformed conclusion that he’s a crank (brought to you by mainstream media), they would agree with much of what he says, or at least see that it’s not “quackery” and that there is reasoning and evidence behind it.

He is not a quack. He can be wrong on some things, but he is not a quack. And he is pretty clearly right on many things (industry capture of regulatory agencies being the best and broadest example).

In summary, I suggest reading his books earnestly and honestly. And probably stop taking mainstream media soundbites and spin as gospel.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"I’m saying that if one has questions about his knowledge or positions, there is a lot of very detailed and well-sourced material that he has made available to answer those questions (and then you can disagree or argue against his *actual* points, rather than just say he isn’t qualified). He has clearly researched the food, drug, and medical industries and practices extensively, which I would argue serves as a pretty strong qualification for this role.

But also, I will echo what a couple others here have said: he has as much official medical credentials as most people historically assigned to this position. To suggest that he doesn’t belong in this position because he is not a trained doctor completely ignores what this position actually is.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"The world’s richest man has the ear of the world’s most powerful man. What could go wrong?

On Nov. 8, Elon Musk hopped on a [diplomatic call](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/08/musk-trump-zelensky-ukraine-call) between President-elect Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Musk isn’t just a billionaire presidential funder, but a high-powered government contractor whose businesses were promised $3 billion across nearly 100 different contracts and 17 agencies last year, according to a recent [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html) tally. And Musk’s Starlink satellite internet systems have been key to Ukrainian military efforts in its war against Russia—paid for by the [Pentagon](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/01/starlink-ukraine-pentagon-elon-musk/). More recently, Trump put Musk and billionaire businessman Vivek Ramaswamy in charge of a [new effort](https://slate.com/technology/2024/11/elon-musk-doge-twitter-purge-government-vivek-ramaswamy.html) he says will reduce government bureaucracy.

All of this makes Musk the most visible American oligarch. Yes, oligarch. While oligarchs are typically thought of as Eastern European businessmen with considerable sway over government, Northwestern University political science professor Jeffrey Winters says we need to start applying the label not only to Musk but to many of America’s ultrawealthy.

Trump is supported by billionaires with names you’ve heard of, such as the Winklevoss twins of Facebook fame, and those you might not have, like banking heir Timothy Mellon, who donated [$76.5 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leokamin/2024/08/14/here-are-trumps-top-billionaire-donors/) to Trump and aligned groups. Meanwhile, Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg, and other American oligarchs threw their support behind Kamala Harris.

Slate spoke with Winters about oligarchy—his area of focus—and how to think about wealth and power in Trump’s America. [https://slate.com/business/2024/11/donald-trump-election-elon-musk-bill-gates-american-oligarcy-wealthy-donors-politics.html](https://slate.com/business/2024/11/donald-trump-election-elon-musk-bill-gates-american-oligarcy-wealthy-donors-politics.html)",2024_11_16,05_24_51

Democrats lose enthusiasm specifically because they respond to oligarch pressures and we all know it. 

Why didn't the Biden administration come down harder on Israel for the genocide? Simple. A lot of oligarchs are deeply in bed with Israel, and they don't want parties speaking out against Israel. 

The oligarchy was already here. It has been for a long time. What you see is infighting between one group of ""status quo"" oligarchs who mostly want to keep the system running as is and keep it stable, which are Democrat oligarchs.

This is why I'm tuning out of the media.

Vote # are very peculiar this year. Especially in swing states, there are wild inconsitencies in the number of ballots that voted trump only vs historical trends and non swing states. A number of security experts have called attention to the fact that tabulation machines may have been hacked!

Check out this sub and consider contacting the Harris campaign and your reps to request a hand recount.

According to these experts an automated audit may miss the error but a hand recount in a few rando counties in swing states should reveal any discrepancies, if they exist.


Here's what some experts are saying: [Election Security Letter](https://out.reddit.com/t3_1gri4i8?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffreespeechforpeople.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F11%2Fletter-to-vp-harris-111324.pdf&token=AQAAWHA3Z1LrkSGOF2e09FhqqTKeD1fvko-AnxPgZ_QlFq4mtvKB&app_name=reddit.com) this is a pdf !


Bear in mind the Trump team had 4 years to probe *exactly* how our election system works and its vulnerabilities, especially with the dominion probe.


Interestingly enough precinct using Dominion tavulators had consistently the greatest shifts towards trump, even in traditional blue areas. *BUT* areas that tabulated earlier in the nite or required hand recounts somehow bucked that trend, across the board.  This could be indicative of the execution of a timed code switch. The hack could have been activated during tabulation on voting night.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

A pretty decent percentage of the population believes that different shadowy figures and organizations have been influencing politics for years in some of the most convoluted ways imaginable and yet many of these same people seemingly have no issue with billionaires like Musk doing the same shit in the most blatant and public fashion. We have stagnant wages, ever increasing wealth inequality, and a shrinking middle class, but people are putting their faith in billionaires as if our interests are somehow aligned.

Musk pretty openly tried to buy this election and people seemingly don't give a shit as long as it's in service of their party's candidate.

The federal Govt. isn't the glue that binds the local levels together, sure they are important obviously but the strategy of trying to convince, clean up and reason with MAGA has not worked at all over the last 8 years.  It won't work going forward.  So we need to stop.  America survived and came through the civil rights movement, the great depression, wars, etc.  We can survive this just fine but we need to stop focusing on ""End of democracy"" and fighting with crazy.  You are not going to win fighting crazy directly and cleaning up after them.

D's need to focus more on the state and local levels A LOT MORE.  They have to build from the bottom up again by getting candidates elected to state houses, country boards, council seats, mayors, and governorships.  They need to start to control the LOCAL MESSAGING more so than the national messaging.  Once you win the local messaging, it's a lot easier to win the national messaging.

A lot more people are more familiar with their local policies and officials and are more likely to ""trust"" them than federal officials from Washington because those are the policies that they feel and interact with daily in their hometowns.

Once they work on implementing their messaging and policies at a local and state level first, they can then build up to federal / cross country level.  Building up that local-level messaging and support through local politics is a lot more effective than just ad blasting out on tv's and radio.

You can still get a TON done with implementing laws, regulations and policies at a local level rather than a federal level, especially if you control state / local legislatures, commission boards, council seats, etc.

It's what R's did after 2008 when Obama took office after they got shellacked and the D's took over congress and the white house.

Dem's need the people to see and feel, at the LOCAL level, that their policies are working and benefiting the people.  When they feel and see it, they are more likely to go along and agree with those policies at a national level.

There will always be the hardcore D's and R's who you'll never convince, no matter what, but luckily those people are not the majority and are fringe.  

D's need to start to put in the work at the local level rather than thinking that blasting social media messages, radio, tv ads and paying influencers once every 2 years is effective, it's not.

Among the most recent was a MASSIVE infrastructure investment bill, something that hasn't been able to pass for decades.

The inflation Reduction Act dealt with boosting renewable energy, emmision reduction, prescription drug costs. 

The CHIPS Act Building semi-conductor campuses and tech hubs all over the country, education investments to train people, research and development and so on.

I know inflation isn't biden's fault.  It's a global issue due to greedy corporations and supply chain messes after covid, also the world's addiction to borrowing too.

but at the end of the day that's not a winning message to tell folks who are struggling to afford basic necessities, housing, education, healthcare, etc.

I understand policies implemented now won't be felt for years and trump will benefit from that and whoever comes after trump will have a mess to deal with, but what I'm saying is what D's should do is, instead of fear-mongering messages they need to focus on the grassroots more to build back voters

Much int he same way R's did after Obama won in 2008 and 2012.  R's took over state houses, governorships, etc and built a local machine based on fear that they took nationally

D's need to do the same locally but not base the messaging on fear, but on actual policies and things that help people locally.

"Just commenting on the clickbait headline ""The End of US Democracy Was All Too Predictable"".  It was all too predictable a long time ago, when Reagan and the Republicans went all in on Trickle Down Economics.  What wasn't predictable is how this backasswards economy would make it so much harder to accrue retirement wealth across the board and that the Federal Minimum Wage wouldn't follow inflation.  The wealthy and the government weren't just happy with the wealthy and corporations paying lower taxes they wanted to pay employees lower wages as well.  Democracy is not ending because of Trump it is ending because of Income Inequality and greed.  Trump ran on the same slogan as Obama, Hope and Change.  What I have learned is there is no Hope and Change when long as we back a POP Economy that focus on 'Profits Over People'.  That is both the Republicans and the Democrats Parties true slogan ""Profit Over People' above all other concerns.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Long forgotten from that Philadelphia courthouse, when asked whether a monarchy or republic was the order of the business in America, Dr. Franklin mischievously hyphenated '248': ""A republic madam -- if you can keep it.""

This was foreseen.  

Analogy: the USS Aircraft Carrier holds free and fair elections for a new Commanding Officer.  One 'side' seeks to fully corporatize the ship into a private navy; the other proudly serves the U.S. Navy.  Well, slightly above half of one-half of ship's company chose their economy over humanity (the missing ingredient that creates democracy btw). 

They need to shut down one of the reactors (continuity of movement...remember; and also there's 3 in this analogy: legislative, exec...yada) shift propulsion supply to under single control (very difficult); use their own designs (Project 2025) to disassemble the ship, restructure it, test it, and run it; in 2 years (2026 midterms = final test of free and fair elections); and before they run aground on 1/20/25.

The laugh you might be hearing from below decks is Reactor Department pissing its collective FRVs at the thought of these fools thinking they can run around getting close to even Step 2...the silence above on the O-3 is the JAG reassuring the current Captain that long before the ship was even built -- somewhere around Federalist No. 10 -- this was comfortably foreseen; and specifically calculated for in advance.  The somber rests in the air are the sorrow some veterans might feel -- now ronin; gazing at the coastline aching to see the stars and stripes sail freely once more.  

But Lady Liberty hasn't even opened her eyes, yet cried out; she was merely violated in her sleep.  Yet awake, the pain will be real and while it might not cost as much as a carton of eggs...is worth defending for so much and many more.

Democracy has merely entered the testing phase, shipmate; all signs indicate positive.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"I’d say thank the founding fathers, but ironically one of the people we may have to thank is Adam Smith, widely regarded as the ‘grandfather of political economy’. His ideas shaped much of our political culture and our capitalist system, including some of the ways in which our actual system of government would need to behave to keep his own vision of a capitalist system in check. 

I’ve been learning about the guy recently. He understood many of these problems regarding the nature of governments, how they interact with people of extreme wealth and influence, social stratification and division, and so on. Like many others from that time, he understood a lot for the time he lived in. Men of his era never could have predicted things like this though. They warned against even many of their own ideas, though, and Smith was one of many who expressed caution about concentration of power and wealth, and of the need to check those forces for the greater good. 

I really think he would be sick today to know how people on the right who have gone and created all of his worst fears about the ideas he himself set forth. Perhaps he’d be impressed still by how long his ideas had endured, but still. He very strongly opposed wealthy folks who didn’t use their wealth or power responsibly, or acted selfishly, in fact. He thought it was a moral duty for those with those privileges to look after their fellow man, and criticized any idea or person who didn’t agree with that. 

If he came back to the present day and learned how his ideas have been twisted and misrepresented by greedy men of power and privilege he’d be devastated. His ideas of free markets and minimal government intervention have been weaponized and used to convince the laboring masses to destroy our liberal democracy and turn us into an oligarchy. He’d probably be horrified that the beliefs he championed went wrong in all the ways he knew that it could.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"One of the first stories after the election was Lara Trump, head of the RNC (and daughter-in-law of Donald Trump) floating the idea of federalizing national elections.  Basically, to take running national elections out of the hands of the states and have a unified, federal system.  Which the RNC would be happy to help create.  

We have got to stop acting like we're going to have an open, level playing field in 2026 or beyond.  We aren't.  The Trumpists explicitly look to Hungary (Viktor Orban speaks at US conservative conferences!) as well as other ""illiberal democracies"" such as Turkey as an example.  This is not hyperbole.  This is dead-ass reality.  This is the goal.  

You will get to vote.  You will get to post on the internet - probably.  You'll get to have a few local victories.  But the goal is that nothing you do will change anything in a meaningful way.  You'll vote, but you'll know the results beforehand.  

Trump has a plan that will outlast him.  JD Vance was the youngest Senator in Washington, and even more than Trump is a student - and fan - of autocracy.  We have got to stop with the games and point-scoring and cutesy nicknames and start realizing just where we are and where we are going.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

I would support Trump for changing the repayment rules. If you voluntarily enter into a debt, should you not be expected to repay the debt?  My mortgage and credit cards believe so.

First of all, they don't even have the jurisdiction to do so, secondly, it would make it impossible for them to do anything.

It's more about the fact that you can expel the debt. Credit cards and mortgages can be remediated via bankruptcy. They aren't the same kind of debt.,2024_11_16,05_24_51
"While I understand the point you are making, the level of interest accrued makes it difficult to payoff. People should not be paying off more interest than they owe. At the same time an educated population does lead to innovation and a better economy in theory for more people as opposed to just accruing debt on a credit card. Part of this dates back to decisions Reagan made. Companies have become downright predatory and I think there is this myth that everyone with debt went to school for some absurd degree when in reality it's a lot of teachers, doctors, etc. 

Fixing this whether it involved making it more manageable would impact everyone positively. People who actually spend money would have more to spend which impacts local businesses and trades as well as contractors. 

PPP loans costed US twice as much as the original loan plan would have as well",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"The Supreme Court ruled that Biden’s broad student loan forgiveness plan was illegal because it exceeded the authority granted under the HEROES Act of 2003. That law allows changes to federal loans during national emergencies, but the Court found it didn’t authorize widespread forgiveness without Congress. However, the ruling didn’t strike down all changes to the system. Adjustments like the new income-driven repayment rules and temporary pauses are still legal because they fall within the Department of Education’s authority.

The idea that borrowers should be expected to repay their debts makes sense in theory, but it ignores the unique nature of student loans. At 18, most borrowers don’t have the financial literacy to fully understand the long-term consequences of their decisions. Unlike mortgages or credit cards, student loans are nearly impossible to discharge in bankruptcy, so borrowers are often stuck no matter their financial situation. The system is also inherently flawed—tuition inflation and predatory lending practices mean colleges often benefit far more than students. In this context, loan forgiveness isn’t about dodging responsibility; it’s about fixing a broken system and investing in the broader economy.

Raising the borrowing age might seem like a solution, but it could end up hurting lower-income and first-generation students who rely on loans to access higher education. Delaying college can reduce lifetime earnings and opportunities, so restricting access isn’t the answer. Instead, we should focus on financial literacy education, loan caps, or reforms that align loans with post-graduation earning potential.

The bigger question is whether we should treat education like a market commodity. College is often a necessity for economic mobility, so student loans aren’t purely voluntary in the same way as consumer debt. If the system is driving people into unsustainable debt while benefiting institutions, that’s a systemic problem—not just an individual responsibility issue. Student loan forgiveness and reform aren’t about letting borrowers off the hook; they’re about addressing the deeper flaws in the system.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

Similar to many of Biden's downfalls. He wouldn't even pull so much as a knife in self-defense during a gunfight. He'd just lecture a mugger to death, ""well, son, you know really shouldn't be doing this, but I guess, if you really have to, here's my wallet -- but if you don't mind, could you Fedex it back to me when you're done with it?""",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Have you ever looked at a30 year mortgage for buying a home?  If you did, you would also vote against 30 years mortgages in the USA.  Japan has 40 year mortgages (and are worse).

If you say No, then should that not limit all other 18 year old options/decisions (if they do not have the mental capacity to make decisions affecting their future lives)? 

If you say 'Yes, then should they not be held liable for that decision? 

Currently, an 18 year old can buy a car, a home, and enter into credit card agreements.  So much more.  If you say they cannot contract for an education loan, would that not affect the other options?",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"While not debt free, we at least ran with a surplus under Clinton. During those years we also had low debt to GDP ratio, debt reduction, growing economy and homeownership. Voting in Bush after that was an abject disaster.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
The issue is not about choice as much as it is predatory methods of greed that lines the pockets of others that needs to be addressed. Couple that wage growth for workers has gone up about 20% while cost for schooling has by about 160% in the last 40 years and it goes beyond signing things away. People can't just stop going to school. And I do think we should be teaching information on topics like interest rates and how to manage finances in high school to better prepare kids that will be making these decisions.,2024_11_16,05_24_51
"It’s the responsibility of society to educate its workforce, and to provide opportunity for all. You’re fixated on this “personal responsibility” trope as if education and access to the workforce should be reserved for…who exactly?  Student loan forgiveness is righting the wrongs built into the system, and the economic benefits of folks freeing up their income from this debt would massively grow the economy - more than what is lost from these repayments.  

So who deserves the money more?  The people, or the banks?  If you owned a small business, wouldn’t you want folks with more money in their pockets going to you? 

A simple google search will provide enough evidence the positive benefits to society at large.  But only if you’re capable of getting off your personal responsibility high horse.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"I mean, I do my best. I teach, I donate and I tithe. I try to treat everyone as best I can and I am all for more of my taxes going for others who need assistance.

"Yet you conveniently forget.  The price of college education has risen exponentially.  Yet the 18 year olds are making the poor decisions to attend 4 year colleges out of state to get out of their homes (by choice).  They make the poor decision yet being warned by so many. So shouldn't their choices have repercussions? 

Note: I have a relative who graduated recently with $0 in college debt with a bachelor's degree.  It can be done but requires wise choices.  Choices by someone who wants to make wise choices (and not choices of convenience).  If you want to make foolish choices, you should have to face the repercussions! It may be harsh, but you made the choice!",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"Just because a person or two can do so doesn't mean it's within the realm of possibilities to be the norm and that is great your niece could do that. The cost of public schools has more than tripled in today's numbers since the 80s. More people obviously should make use of these schools, but until very recently the investment per pupil had also decreased by 25% or so in that period. Other countries don't have people swimming in debt out of college and that is on the system more so than the average person

And I don't completely disagree with you that there should be some personal responsibility and more of an investment in education that should go into teaching kids these things. Just that we need to address predatory methods here.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
You seem pretty out of touch with the reality of most people that go to school and have to work full time. Almost everyone I know that's pursuing a bachelor's degree also has a full-time job. And that barely covers the bills. No one I know is taking any ridiculous majors. It's almost always stem classes or something that is guaranteed a career. Even with all the trades you have to have an education nowadays if you want to be competitive.,2024_11_16,05_24_51
"The cost of a college education has risen exponentially. But the mindset allowed to an 18-year-old is still the same.  That they can be considered an adult at age 18, means they can enter into many contracts. They can participate in many positive and negative contracts. 

That they choose to be foolish in the age 18 choices is their right, correct? If you believe they should not have the right, what is the answer? Do you want legislation that they can only attend in state universities until a different age? That they must stay at home before attending college away from home until a certain age? If age is an issue, do you restrict them from entering the military at age 18? SO many issues to deal with based on age.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

Trump had announced he was tapping Hegseth as his next secretary of defense after only days of considering the veteran-turned-Fox News host and very little internal vetting. Within 48 hours, the heads of Trump’s transition team were brought a complaint about a sexual assault allegation regarding Hegseth.

Hegseth was a speaker at a conference held by the California Federation of Republican Women at a hotel during the timeframe when the alleged assault took place, according to photos of the event posted on Facebook. Hegseth has not been charged in any criminal case or named as a defendant in any civil lawsuit filed in Monterey County since 2017, and his attorney denied any wrongdoing.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"The writer assumes that it's possible to emphasize or de-emphasize so-called ""gender stereotypes"" like a volume dial on a radio. Men and boys have innate tendencies, preferences, drives and mindsets. Trying to eradicate those is a futile endeavor. One of the reasons male students do so poorly in school in the 21st century is that much of modern education tends to downplay, discourage, and quash those tendencies, and the result -- unsurprisingly -- is that boys tune out. 77% of public school teachers in the United States are female. It's become a feminized environment in which cooperation trumps competition and offense is considered the greatest sacrilege. Boys don't like that and they have trouble processing that, but they also have trouble expressing their resistance to it, so when something comes along that throws a wrench into the gears, they like it. That's why they're quietly celebrating. It's not hard to figure out, but the writer presents it like all of society is at risk if boys act like boys. You're never going to eliminate male bonding.

"I made it through the third paragraph and had read enough. 

This is what the media has preached for 10 years now. There is a fear over what they THINK may happen. People used to be judged on what they DID. Now, many judge people on what they think those people WILL (somehow leaving no doubt about it) do. 

You could argue that Trump’s first term was a success other than a pandemic that hasn’t been seen since the 1920’s. You could argue that Trump’s first term was a failure based on things like people being forced back into work or a poor preparation in case a pandemic happened. 

It used to be that you could disagree with a President’s policies and direction but you always respected the Office of the President of the United States. Does anyone remember what took down President Jimmy Carter? He did a Playboy interview where he said he had had ‘lustful thoughts for women other than his wife’. Think about that being the American moral standard that would force a President to not run for reelection and how far we have come. 

You can think and believe you want. But why criticize something that has not happened yet. TRULY feel it will? Then talk about it but don’t make it an absolute. Give people a chance to fail before ripping them apart. (You want to list all the reasons you think Trump’s first term was a disaster then I could list the reasons it was a success. That is a given). If that person turns out to be a positive influence, do you think they are going to want to work with someone who has been ripping their ideas apart? If you just talk to them, even with your doubts, they may do SOMETHING you suggested that they agree with. If you just fight them, why SHOULD they listen to you? 

I’m just saying to write your concerns down if you want to. 3 years from now, look at the list and honestly judge if Trump’s impact has been positive, negative, or not been addressed. Then say what you want.",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"Men and boys like these are acting logically to protect the dominance they have had for tens of thousands of years over women. I say this as a woman.

Any progress that women have made up to now has been considered by men to be out of largesse, not because men have suddenly, after millenia, realized that women are equally capable, equally intelligent, and equal humans born with the same rights, thoughts, and inner narrative as any man.

Men still do not think of women as fully human. Women's progress has been met with tolerance up to now--when the imbalance was still quite high--but now men are beginning to be threatened. Women are better educated than men and are, slowly, beginning to catch up with men in terms of wages, if not in terms of power (corporate, political, economic). And so men (and boys) view women's progress now as a threat to their dominance, even though women are far less safe, far less well-paid, far less powerful, and far less respected than men in general.  I'm sure this has been made worse by difficult economic circumstances. Such times tend to make people think in zero-sum terms (anything someone else gets means less for me).

And so men are beginning to retrench.

I think we will see an uptick in violence against women. I think we will see further attempts to restrict women's rights around the globe, both politically and practically. I think we will see the violent, misogynist Andrew Tate-type propaganda continue to swell. I think any reasonable woman would be well-served to learn self-defense and potentially learn how to (safely) handle a firearm, much as I dislike guns.

As gaming exploded through covid, and continues to explode, and as outside opportunities to find people to play with continue to diminish, the alt-right has positioned themselves in the discord groups and in the gaming community for A DECADE. 

Not only were they using this to spread subtle misogyny, but they were also there talking to these boys and finding out what problems they had in their lives, and discovering a message (authentic or exploitative is irrelevant) that resonated with them. 

Democrats as a whole, and progressive families individually, have essentially abandoned these kids to the gaming community. There's nothing wrong with gaming itself. But the fact that the alt-right has essentially taken over the narrative in those communities makes it a brainwashing pit of casual racism, sexism, ableism, and more. 

Again, they TOLD us they were doing this A DECADE ago. And we did nothing, as a society. We just let them have that territory. We made no effort whatsoever to inject ourselves into those communities or take them back or provide an alternate narrative.

"The Walz memes that came out were great and would have provided an imperfect alternative to Trump's toxic masculinity, should the Democrats have decided to flip the ticket to Walz/Harris.

This podcast goes into the currently problems with young boys and young men:  [https://freakonomics.com/podcast/why-are-boys-and-men-in-trouble/](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/why-are-boys-and-men-in-trouble/)

Basically, we gave women more options (which is great), but this started changing the expected roles. Women could be homemakers, OR all this new stuff. And men could be breadwinners, or, no, maybe not anymore, men should feel fine if the women are breadwinners. But also don't be stay-at-home-dads bc that makes you kind of a loser. And slowly but surely, the narrative for young men became thinner and thinner, not because we took anything away, but because women expanded into their domain and nobody gave them a new narrative of what that could look like in a good way. 

Someone like Walz, a teacher, football coach, governor, memes where you do manly things that aren't toxic, etc. That could have courted these young men. Of course it would have been hard; dems were so far behind the curve in this demographic that it might not have mattered. But someone like Walz could have phrased abortion in a way that resonated with young men. ""You're 23. You're in college. Are you ready to be a breadwinning father? Do you know this girl enough to commit to 18 years of raising a kid? Do you want her to feel trapped or forced to be with you forever? Or do you still want to explore the world a bit. Women's rights are men's rights, because for every woman that feels trapped by an unwanted pregnancy, there's a man that's handcuffed to her.""",2024_11_16,05_24_51
"You've nailed it with the assessment that these younger men took away the message you spelled out here. The question I've been pondering as a 41 year old husband and father of two daughters is how can I (we) interject and reach these young men to show them they are the product of the media they're consuming and that's what we're criticizing without them taking it personally and shutting down before we can connect and show them that masculinity isn't about being ""alpha,"" it's about taking care of those around you and being there for those that need you. It hurts to watch so many young men be led down this self-destructive, isolated path by grifters like Andrew Tate.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"This is probably the best response to the thread.

I’m a 38YO WM liberal as fuck and I cannot remember a time it was this bad. Young men don’t have hero’s anymore, full stop. Good job with that liberals…you like George Washington? You support slavery. You like old westerns and going “pow pow” with your finger guns? You support racism and rape. You don’t support Taylor swifts boyfriend? You are a misogynist. 

We have managed to almost completely equalize any good role models or hero’s for young men out of the equation. And we did it fast as humanly possible with literally no room to grow or make a mistake. We did that and didn’t offer up anyone to replace them. 

Is someone in your class trans and you used their old name by accident? You’re a bigot dead namer, these are adult assed terms kids throw at each other. Only a matter of time before they say fuck it.

We can’t even make a good comedy movie anymore because everything makes the liberals camp up and shit all over it. Could we make tropic thunder right now? Absolutely not. The liberals have gotten so smart in everything culture related that they can tell you precisely how insufferable they are. 

Frankly speaking, I think the mask is slipping because people (white men) are tired of trying to be your ally and then immediately shat all over if it’s not done perfectly every time. Young men have less patience obviously than an adult, so they immediately say fuck it. 

The republicans have seen that, drilled in on it and liberals have probably permanently lost those voters. They found that gaming culture is where men had a spot to be ding dongs and say stupid shit to edgelord each other and women and pearl clutchers weren’t lurking en masse ready to attempt to ruin their life with some type of gnarly accusation.  

In college I was put in the middle of the class with 4 other white men in an urban studies class, we were told to sit in the middle as there were only 4 of us in this urban studies class, it was when the whole confederate statues thing was popping off. The professor then said “ask these white men why the statues are still up or what their opinion of them are.” Kennesaw state university, social sciences building behind the Starbucks. I was fucking shocked. It’s shit like that, that is losing you white men and making authoritarian strongmen look good.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

That thing we do where we say ""don't men think of the daughters, mothers, sisters in their lives?"" when we discuss male empathy around various issues - I think this is the equivalent, and taking it seriously isn't an attack on women.

"There's a lot of man=bad messaging out there. The lack of context about why that is has been left to the man-o-sphere to define for the boys, and it's negative and self-marginalizing. Feminist absolutism played a big role in that, and I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that. Men are not inherently bad, there are just bad men the same as there are bad women. The whiplash of normalizing the power balance between men and women over the course of a few years is probably what drove a lot of this, and probably responsible for this new backlash. I'm not saying it wasn't right or necessary, just providing context.

I think it's probably the same with trans rights. That's a good thing, but the way it was thrust forward from zero to 100 provided a lot of fertile ground for people to be confused and seeded with misinformation. It's also a misconception to believe that all gay people are on board with that process too, because their rights were acquired slowly over 50 years at a rate that didn't disturb the straight people too much.

Edit: Honestly, I think the push around ""man-spreading"" a few years ago has a lot to do with the opening of this can of worms. Men were admonished for it, and I don't think it was necessarily warranted in all cases. I remember seeing memes of boys/men taking up more than their ""share"" of space on the subway, and the reaction being vitriolic and negative.

"See, as a woman, I am very skeptical of this answer. What I see is women and others legitimately complaining, often for the first time, that men are not treating them well. It seems like your main complaint here is that women want men to be more mindful on the subway and other public spaces? And men didn't like hearing that? I mean, sure -- I guess it's unpleasant to hear that something you've done forever without thinking about it as being bad for others.

But I do wish that men, instead of getting defensive, would think, ""huh, good point, I AM taking up a lot of space without thinking about it."" It's not very much to ask honestly!

And what is feminist absolutism? Define it. Explain. Because if feminism is the belief that women deserve equal rights to men, by virtue of their humanity, then feminist absolutism is...the belief in that equality, absolutely. Sign me up!

Also, I'd call attention to your phrasing about gay rights: ""their rights were acquired slowly over 50 years at a rate that didn't disturb the straight people too much."" I think you are probably a lot younger than I am, because I am old enough to know--and partially to remember from when I was a kid--that the progression of gay rights has come, not gradually, but in fits and starts and often through a lot of unpleasant protests involving gay people being nuisances to straight people to make them pay attention. That is the way that progress happens. Half-measures do nothing. Asking pretty please does nothing. Demanding and making yourself a nuisance is what makes progress.

And finally, women and gay people and black people and trans people have no obligation to wait until the people who are oppressing them are comfortable ceding them their basic human rights. We will not wait because it is what we are owed and deserved from birth.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of defense, was investigated for an “alleged sexual assault” in 2017 by police in Monterey, California, the city said in a statement, which was first reported by Vanity Fair.

The city’s statement did not say what happened to the case or provide any indication that charges were considered against Hegseth. But the revelation that the complaint was brought against him and investigated by the police has roiled the Trump transition team and raised new questions about the viability of Hegseth’s nomination to lead the nation’s military.

The president-elect was not told about the extent of the sexual misconduct allegation before he chose him as the Pentagon nominee because no private firm vetted him, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.

"A 12-year-old boy died during football practice due to a malformed blood vessel in his brain. And RFK Jr used the boy's photo for the cover of a book he co-published; it was falsely written in the book that the boy died from the COVID Vaccine. The boy never received the vaccine.

[https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-2ccde2df146f57b5e8c26e8494f0a16a](https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-2ccde2df146f57b5e8c26e8494f0a16a)

""No one ever contacted them to ask about their son’s death, or for permission to use the photo. No one asked to confirm the date of his death — which the book misdated by a year. When the Faheys and residents of their town in California tried to contact the publisher and author to get Braden and his picture taken out of the book, no one responded.

...

Braden’s story is just one example of how Kennedy, son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, has used his famous name to disseminate false information about vaccines and other topics in a time when spreading conspiracy theories has become a powerful way to grow a constituency. An AP examination of his work and its impact found Kennedy has earned money, fame and political clout while leaving people like the Faheys suffering.""",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Over the past few years, I’ve been reflecting on how different policies have impacted my life. Personally, I felt I did better under the previous administration’s policies than I have under the current one. These last three years have been particularly challenging and stressful for me.

At the same time, I find myself growing increasingly frustrated with career politicians. I’ve noticed that much of what is discussed in mainstream media often feels misleading or oversimplified, making it hard to find the truth. For example, during the last election cycle, I took the time to research claims about issues like Russia collusion, accusations of racism, and concerns about constitutional values. In doing so, I came to my own conclusions, which led me to support Trump’s policies.

I understand that everyone’s perspective is shaped by their own experiences, and we may not all see things the same way.

"Both parties are bad.  Neither one as a whole gives a shit about regular folk.  A few do, but not the majority.  They may sound like it when they talk, but their actions speak louder.

and again, this is what America wanted.  They wanted this.  So let them find out.  We've been screaming the same message daily for 8 years (Trump will destroy everything) and technically it hasn't happened, so they no longer give that message any weight

America isn't the federal Govt.  America is our local communities binding together.  The federal Govt. isn't the glue that binds the local levels together, sure they are important obviously but the strategy of trying to convince, clean up and reason with MAGA has not worked at all over the last 8 years.  It won't work going forward.  So we need to stop

D's need to focus more on the state and local levels A LOT MORE.  They have to build from the bottom up again by getting candidates elected to state houses, country boards, council seats, mayors, and governorships.

A lot more people are more familiar with their local policies and officials and are more likely to ""trust"" them than federal officials from Washington because those are the policies that they feel and interact with daily in their hometowns.

Once they work on implementing their messaging and policies at a local and state level first, they can then build up to federal / cross country level.  Building up that local-level messaging and support through local politics is a lot more effective than just ad blasting out on tv's and radio.

You can still get a TON done with implementing laws, regulations and policies at a local level rather than a federal level, especially if you control state / local legislatures, commission boards, council seats, etc.

It's what R's did after 2008 when Obama took office after they got shellacked and the D's took over congress and the white house.

Dem's need the people to see and feel, at the LOCAL level, that their policies are working and benefiting the people.  When they feel and see it, they are more likely to go along and agree with those policies at a national level.

There will always be the hardcore D's and R's who you'll never convince, no matter what, but luckily those people are not the majority and are fringe.  

D's need to start to put in the work at the local level rather than thinking that blasting social media messages, radio, tv ads and paying influencers once every 2 years is effective, it's not.

If the messages you receive don't line up with the reality you deal with daily, you aren't going to believe the messages.  So it's time to start to message locally first, then nationally.  Not the other way around",2024_11_16,05_24_51

The news article reveals the following facts: 
1.  The alleged assault happened between 11:59 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on October 7th and 8th 2017 at a hotel in Monterey california. 
2.  The crime was reported to the Monterey police three days later on October 12th. 
3.   The police report does not name the victim (which is normal) but described the victim as having a contusion (bruise) on her right thigh. 
4.  Per policy, police will not release any additional details from the report including summaries of any other interviews. Obviously charges were not filed.

5.  Per unnamed sources, Trump's chief of staff was briefed on the incident prior to the appointment and there was a meeting with hegseth who described the encounter as consensual and ""he said she said."" 

So the answer to the specific question you are asking is that the investigation didn't have any result. Obviously he wasn't charged but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. Just that either the police didn't find enough evidence or the prosecutor didn't believe that the case could be proven.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

They killed 44.5k, which is a big number. And a scary thing to hear. But, not anywhere near being wiped out. If 98% of people are left that is not being wiped out.

There are three main cities in the Gaza Strip. The Gaza Strip is smaller than the Tucson Metropolitan area. To compare the two. They invaded Marana(Khan Yuns), and Tucson(Gaza City), and have pushed people to South Tucson(Rafah)

Most people are still alive. I don't like to see Palestinians wastefully killed, but Hamas are the Arab KKK. As long as that ideology still exists there won't be peace. As it stands though, they are pretty much defeated. It's going to take them 20 years to rebuild to the point they were before the war.

Nobody switched their vote from Joe Biden to Trump because of Palestine. Those people just stayed home. It wasn't even necessarily a protest abstinence. People who care A LOT about palestine still voted for Kamala for harm reduction. In fact, nobody in general switched from Biden to Trump, Trump got marginally less voters than last election, while the democrat turnout dropped off a cliff.

What actually happened, is that the portion of people who do support palestine, saw Kamala waffling on this shit to please Israel, they just tuned out and stopped caring about getting out of bed to vote for a Liz Cheney Republican with a D next to her name. Low turnout is not necessarily an active choice from voters, it's a result of having policy that generates little to no enthusiasm from her base.

The DNC doesn't decide the order of the states' primaries besides the first 4 contests.  Moreover, Bernie relied vastly more on red states for his wins than Hillary.  

Red States that Hillary won: South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Lousiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, Missouri, Kentucky, and North Dakota. So ten states out of Hillary's 34 contest wins. So around 29% of her wins.

Red States that Bernie won: Oklahoma, Nebraska, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, West Virginia, Indiana, Alaska, Kansas, and South Dakota. So eleven states out of Bernie's 23 contest wins. So around 47% of his wins.

Lets not pretend we broke new ground with biden. The bar is at the floor and biden managed to raise it an inch, sure. But other countries, and America in the past rose the bar high enough for a person to pass under.

Did Biden get the student loan relief he campaigned on through? No. Did Biden get Citizen's united repealed to finally halt corporate ratfucking in policy? No. Did Biden address the housing crisis at all in major cities or suburbs? No. Did Biden's FTC even actually win any major legal challenges that would've negatively affected the economy for any average American? No. Did he reform tax policy so that billionaires can't completely evade paying taxes on their wealth? No. Was he able to get real major long lasting green energy initiatives started or passed? No. Enact restrictions on corporate buyback or other non-productive market manipulation tactics? No. Medicare for all? No. Minimum wage increased? No. Insider trading? No. Reduce or halt military expenditure? No. Was he able to keep the chevron doctrine? No. Create any successful transportation initiative that resulted in any effective major projects? No. Aid unionization efforts? No. Standardize or regulate the exploitation from local utility & internet companies? No. Was he able to keep abortion legal in all 50 states at least?? No. Has literally anything gotten better since Obama's been in office??? No.

But he was able to get noncompetes thrown out so I guess this might as well be our next fucking lenin.

Keep in mind, this is also the same President that appointed Merrick fucking Garland as AG. This administration is a complete fucking joke. You're right that Republicans use emotional appeals and bad faith, but they are able to do so because of how willing democrats are to neglect the working class. Happy, well off citizens don't turn to racism and hate and mental illness.

Things are bad in America, you probably don't own a home due to the housing crisis and corporate interests buying up all the land in the country, maybe you've been hit by layoffs like 3 or 4 times since 2000, etc. This is obviously a terrible situation for the average person. It's an election year, and democrats have basically never been able to, or really even tried to enact any major positive change in the modern era, and don't really even pretend to.

Who do you think that person votes for?

What democrats refuse to do, is run on a platform of anything other than status quo and moderation. And the status quo \*fucking sucks\*. Liz cheney moderates were the exact opposite direction of where we needed to go. Harris's campaign promises were nothing but token promises with highly limited scope.

"you can read up all about. she basically got around campaign finance rules. Debbie Shultz, along with others gave Hillarys campaign full rein on DNC finances. The limit for DNC contributions are higher than what you can give a primary campaign. Months before she was selected many funds from DNC (which are meant for the primary candidate in that specifc state) were being funneled to Hillary. 

Furthermore, she had control on the budget, hiring, communications the DNC had (while not being the nominee). She even got interview questions ahead of time while Sanders didn't get any of these benefits.

""the Joint Fund-Raising Agreement between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund, and Hillary for America.

The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.""

explains why the DNC — which is supposed to be neutral during a primary campaign — was too favorable toward Hillary Clinton.

For example you had DNC’s chief financial officer, Brad Marshall, sent an email asking “for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage.” 

Would a neutral party make these comments?

There is a reason why Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned during the election after her leaked emails appeared to show a co-ordinated effort to aid Mrs Clinton's campaign.

Countless testimonies from humanitarian groups have called out Israel’s purposeful targeting of civilians and especially CHILDREN. Let me say that again, they PURPOSELY TARGET CHILDREN with weapons.

I voted for Kamala Harris, would do it again, but I do empathize with people who think about things like their family being turned into paste while we send $20b aid packages to a country that already outguns the enemy 10 fold.

Not tools to let them level hospitals and schools because Hamas is supposedly hiding in them. Do you maybe think that Hamas is hiding in them because they are fighting an ideological war where their individual deaths for their greater cause isn't a concern? When a missile strikes that hospital and kills 10 Hamas soldiers or whatever, they consider that a win. It breeds another generation of soldiers for them from the families that just lost everything.

"""The Resistance"" is burned the fuck out. 

We've been doing everything we can for months to get the word out, mobilize volunteers, beg people to vote, etc. 

It failed. It all failed. Even after the country knows what a shit job Trump did in his first term as President. It wasn't even close. And we lost both houses of Congress, too. 

This goes beyond losing one election; it looks like the Democrats don't have a competitive national coalition anymore. 

The healthiest thing ""The Resistance"" can do is turn off the news and focus on our real lives for a few weeks. Families, work, things within our locus of control. 

Quite a few of us are drinking or smoking up instead. Friends, if that's your coping strategy, turn off the news, too. Playing the Trump outrage drinking game for too long will kill your liver. 

No, there will not be another massive Women's March in 2025. That was a shitload of work to organize, and what did it do? In the end, not much. Why bother with it again? To give CNN better ratings?

If corporate media is mad that the left isn't driving their ratings post-election, they have only themselves to blame. Trump's in office in large part because corporate media sanewashed Trump while bashing Biden and Harris every chance they got. As far as the left is concerned, corporate media is part of the Republican coalition now. 

""The Resistance"" will be back, but it's going to be months, maybe more. We know that the old strategies won't work, no matter how much effort we put into them. We have to figure out something new, and that will take time. 

IMO, that new platform will have to include the kind of pro-worker, progressive, ""socialist"" policies that corporate media and their billionaire owners hate, so I don't think our eyeballs are coming back to them. 

Suck it, CNN, Musk, and Bezos. Your ratings aren't coming back.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"I've spent close to a decade trying to help people understand simple ideas, like Donald Trump is not a successful businessman, or, Donald Trump has declared bankruptcy 6 times.

Sure at times they play the game of listening, but it always devolves into excuses and denialism, even for a simple idea like ""maybe a guy who has failed at every business endeavor he attempted, and paid $25 million out for fraud, doesn't know a single fucking thing about running a country.""

I say give the majority exactly what they voted for;  remove Obamacare and watch the rural hospitals collapse, insurance companies begin denying care, emergency rooms overrun, medical bankruptcies, high rates of farmer suicides (same as his first term), the removal of mom & pop businesses as they are unable to compete with mega corporations prices, etc, etc.

"What resistance? So, let’s say we had this rental property, call it the White House. A few years ago we made a mistake, and we rented it to a mafioso buffoon and some of his buddies. It was pretty bad, the place got trashed, but there were a couple of slightly tamer roommates that were there to stop the party before the cops got called. We finally ended the lease and tried to fix the place up - but halfway through the repairs we leased it again, and this time the guys who stopped the party aren’t coming back. In their place we have sex traffickers, a guy with brain worms, and a meth head nazi. All of them have said their whole objective is to burn it down. 

So, here’s the deal - we tried fixing it - but based on all we know, after this lease is up, there really won’t be enough left to try to restore it. It’s over - and it will never be the house we grew up in again. How do we expect a fight to materialize when we have already lost what we were fighting for?

There will be a resistance, eventually - once people figure out an alternative vision for what is actually possible in a post-institutional hellscape. But restoring “normal” simply isn’t possible anymore - and that is the only vision that the Overton window of the media and Democratic Party ever gave us.

The standard of perfection the democrats are required to meet in order to win elections is not realistic when there is this much apathy. I honestly think the republicans are going to destroy themselves here and hurt a lot of people. However, based on his policy preferences it’s more going to be the very people that voted for them. They chose to slit their own throats. Maybe they will be more receptive to the left in the future if we still have fair elections. Or maybe Trump is right about everything and we’re wrong.

I think people are just exhausted and honestly what binds the right together is their hatred of the left, not shared policy goals and values. It’s the oxygen that sustains them.

My life is better not caring about these big, complex problems that mostly only effect other people. 


I have been disillusioned by the democrats since Obama promised change, then kept Gitmo open and used drones to kill Americans - but have continued to vote for them and donate because they were always the better option for the working class.


The truth is that they drummed up all of this rhetoric (Trump is a fascist, this will end America, etc.), which may well be true, but they never acted Iike they were in a fight to the death because they think they'll be insulated from any bad consequences.

"> massive Women's March in 2025. That was a shitload of work to organize, and what did it do? In the end, not much. Why bother with it again?

The Women's March in 2017 accomplished plenty. Many organizations spun out of the parade and poured their energies into upcoming elections. It ushered many democratic women into politics. It helped galvanizing non-trump supporters and led to the best ever midterm turnout for both parties and Democratic Party retaking house in 2018. Then, it led to Democratic Party winning the best ever popular vote in 2020. The movement wasn't sustained after 2020, but it was instrumental to the success in 2018 and 2020. People feel empowered when they see and meet their allies.

I think the reason why Democratic Party lost in 2024 is that we didn't have the same turnout as we did in 2020. This was actually predicted in 2022 midterm elections.

There's more than enough conservatives and people who are desperate because of how the ruling class has taken all the money away from the majority of the people that we cannot survive a strike.

So they came up with trickle down economics and sold that message, and ""we"" bought it. Now they hold every card. This is their end game. 

To think we have any sort of power here, in this very moment, is laughable. The only power we have is voting, and we all fear that's about to be taken away too. The leftists who go on about a militant uprising are kidding themselves and are larping - that's not a real possibility, straight up.

To think the people could rise up against a government with tanks, drones and nuclear weapons with the equivalent of sticks is psychotic.

"Goes back to a saying I remember hearing, and that still haunts me when I think about it: Civilization is one generation deep.


A big chunk of Gen Z's formative years were under Trump. The shamelessness, corruption, and political violence were not horrifying aberrations, because there was no prior life to compare to. Bad behavior has been normalized and something cultural has been lost that may never be recovered in our lifetimes. This is just how life works - why oppose it? Why not even participate?


The mechanisms and beliefs that civilization needs to keep bad actors from taking over are really a shared hallucination that require buy-in from the next generation, or else they disappear. They become what they have always been in reality - pigment and pressed wood pulp, rotting slowly on a shelf.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"Racism is thinking that your race is superior to another race or thinking that another race is inferior for some reason. I think all of humankind is shit and should die off. 

I understand that you can't treat entire blocks of voters like veterans, senior citizens, or Latinos and monolithic entities. Many people who did not vote for this will be harmed by it and it isn't fair. This is what their neighbors, communities, and family members overwhelmingly wanted for them.

Lots of Trump policies will effect me personally. Deporting illegal immigrants en masse who are just trying to make a better future for their children will absolutely wreck the economy (which will be compounded by tariffs). My children will be more likely to catch measles, polio, or die from food poisoning. I have dependents with disabilities and their healthcare and quality of life will almost certainly be impacted by this presidency. But this is what my parents wanted for their grandchildren, it's what my work colleagues wanted, it's what my neighbors and community leaders all wanted. 

Individuals will suffer but collectively we deserve whatever happens.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"> Obama spent a lot of time fighting with his fellow democrats, and republicans effectively exploited every opportunity to obstruct that they possibly could. Trump will not have problems like that. 

I do think Trump is going to run into trouble with the House. It's such a thin margin that he needs basically the entire Republican caucus to be present and on-board.

Obama's problem was largely in the Senate. He had a filibuster-proof majority for a few months, and Joe Lieberman was a moderate.

> And yes margins do matter. Dominating the electoral and popular vote matters a lot.

Those results matter in that they hint at future voting patterns, but I don't think Trump really dominated. 312 electors is not a landslide, and there were plenty of states within just a couple percentage points of going the other way. He did win the popular vote, but it also wasn't a landslide.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"I'm not a Trump supporter, especially not one of those where it's their first time voting. It was idiotic to discourage mail in voters, because you need to GOTV and ensure your supporters have a voting plan. 

Likewise, there are dozens of States, thousands of counties, tens of thousands of people who take integrity in elections seriously, who work the polls, with campaign volunteers to watch. 

So when you make assumptions about what I believe, you make an ass out of yourself. Democrats didn't take this election seriously. They literally where calling this the most important election of our lifetime, where they handpicked the candidate, got a billion dollars and lined the pockets of their elitist friends. 

While ordinary people suffer. Just look at her laughing in the bar having a gay old time saying how horrible she's doing with men... and then she skips Joe Rogan. They don't care. She'll just go off and give speeches and be rich. 

The only issue she really pushed was abortion and she wouldn't answer any questions. But abortion is a non-issue now because you'll never have 60 votes in the Senate. Then dems say they'll destroy the filibuster, which going nuclear is how we arrived here in the first place. She's dense.

She makes the same mistakes as a lot of dems do. She thinks there's this mystical young vote that will actually turn out of you tell them that's its the end of the world if the opposition wins. Because she thinks they are so naive they'll believe it.

Sadly. You’re totally right. 

A friend the other day said Trump could have eaten a live baby and won if people thought they’d get cheaper gas. I guess I thought this country was better than it is. That’s my real disappointment. 

Frankly Biden should have stepped away from reelection and opened it up to the primaries. Harris was our best chance after the deadline and she only had 100 days to Trumps 10 years. 

But now we have a conman and a pack of lunatics that will destroy everything this country built because half this country couldn’t bother to spend 10 minutes doing research. 2024 Trump is nothing like 2016 Trump. This is going to be disastrous.

If the issue is solely the FBI and not, say, inability to get clearance approval, why not advocate for one of the myriad other agencies equipped to perform these checks to do them?

For instance, instead of trying to circumvent background checks entirely, he could be asking for a different agency to perform them.

I'm not trying to defend him either, but the issue I take (I won't speak for others) is an attempt to circumvent getting the necessary checks done. In my opinion, if someone can't obtain a clearance, they don't need or deserve to be in these powerful positions.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

If the FBI had that much egg on their face about something they claimed “definitely existed, just wait for it!”, why in the hell would Trump want to have them involved in any way shape or form? I’m sure as far as he’s concerned they have much less capability to be impartial. 

They need to be checked. The FBI should be still reeling from the last 8 years of shit that has happened, and should not be doing those checks.

1. Taxes pay for a lot of things that help us all including schools, teachers, roads, bridges, libraries, museums, police, firefighters, medical and scientific research, homeless shelters, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, national defense, veterans benefits, clean water, FDA, CDC, food stamps, college grants, disaster aid, etc. Giving tax cuts to the rich takes away from all that. 

2. Most of the tax revenue is paid for by the rich. So yes, cutting their taxes takes a massive chunk away from all that. 

Okay another point, whether we cut their taxes, keep them same, or increase them substantially, they’ll still be insanely rich and live like kings. 

So much suffering to please a few thousand greedy assholes is insane and immoral.

- Elmo is so much richer than you, Dump. It’s almost embarrassing how far ahead he is. Maybe you should stick to selling hats and slumlording?
- Elmo's businesses actually push boundaries and innovate, while your 'empire' is a dusty asbestos filled relic. Guess who’s actually shaping the future old man?
- What’s it like being constantly overshadowed by a guy who’s got Mars on his mind while you can’t even manage getting into a truck?
- Elmo’s IQ must dwarf yours. Can you even follow half the things he says, or do you just smile and nod like usual?
- Elmo’s just using you for the spectacle. He’s probably laughing behind your back with his real billionaire friends.

The problem now it that Trump thinks he doesn't need Russia anymore, he's the leader of the most powerful nation in the world and he's going to flex that.

Trump hates Putin and would love to see him gone.  Trump was in a ""walking on eggshells"" relation with Putin and now that has changed.  The war with Ukraine showed the cracks and emboldened Trump into thinking he's untouchable.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

In normal times, if there's some big problem or issue, the president would put together a team to figure stuff out or how to deal with something and then take their recommendations and go about prioritizing and implementing them. No ego needed. The president is there to be a manager, and to manage experts and teams and departments, not to be the bestest boy and push everyone else down.

"""If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room"".  

I understand the sentiment, but has always struck me as a little flawed.  That means someone there must be in the wrong room.

He doesn't have leverage anymore. Trump is probably putting him in a role because Elon showed him loyalty and he wants to be surrounded by loyalists. I doubt Putin needs Elon to spy on Trump.

Everything he has done is against the US’ interests and he can no longer be trusted to be the sole means for military and scientific payloads to be launched.

"Gaetz is the worst of the cabinet picks in that it has the highest potential for targeted destruction.

RFK Jr. is by far the pick with the potential for the most widespread mass damage. Weakening health outcomes, decreased QoL and LE, redux in medical research, or mass death in the event of a pandemic, just to name **a few** of the direct  consequences.

"His involvement in the measles outbreak in Samoa really stands out to me

For more information, tune into *Behind the Bastards* recent four-part series that examines RFK Jr.'s life and career.

It really highlights the pathology of the guy, his life long privilege, and his many perversions.

In 2019, there was a measles outbreak in Samoa that claimed the lives of 83 people, mostly children. What did Kennedy have to do with this? Well, of course he denies any involvement, but he visited the island a few months prior to the outbreak, and at the time, he led the Children's Health Defense organization, basically an anti-vax non profit.

His non profit helped spread misinformation pertaining to vaccines that contributed to a decline in measles vaccinations. During his trip to Samoa, he publicly supported prominent anti-vax voices there and by exploiting the power of his last name, lent legitimacy to those voices who were very effective at stoking vaccine hesitancy.

Now, prior to 2019, measles wasn't a problem in Samoa, however, in 2018, two infants died after receiving the measles vaccine. The country temporarily placed its vaccination program on hold, and Kennedy's Children's Health Defense took advantage of the tragedy to raise questions about the safety of the measles vaccine. Consequently the vaccination rate plummeted.

As it turns out however, the deaths of the infants had nothing to do with the measles vaccine, and everything to do with tragic human error. Nurses administering the vaccine accidentally mixed it with a muscle relaxant, which is what killed the infants.

Kennedy and his non profit did not walk back their statements afterwards, particularly as vaccination rates were dropping rapidly in the region.

When he visited the island in 2019—before the outbreak—he promoted anti-vaxxers and anti-vax rhetoric. He especially lent credibility to voices there that were still using the deaths of the infants to push a narrative.

> He had a meeting with Taylor Winterstein, a prominent Samoan Australian vaccination foe. In an Instagram post featuring a photo of her with Kennedy, Winterstein wrote, “I am deeply honoured to have been in the presence of a man I believe is, can and will change the course of history. This was a divinely timed, once in a lifetime opportunity and I will forever cherish the conversations and moments we shared together in Samoa.” She added hashtags used by anti-vaxxers. Public health experts complained Kennedy’s visit to Samoa helped amplifly anti-vax voices.

Kennedy claimed that his meeting with Winterstein was just a coincidence, not ""divinely timed."" He eventually admitted however, that his trip to Samoa had been arranged with a popular anti-vaxxer, Edwin Tamasese. The trip was paid for by the CHD.

> The point of the trip, he insisted, was to discuss with government officials “the introduction of a medical informatics system that would allow Samoa’s health officials to assess, in real time, the efficacy and safety of every medical intervention or drug on overall health.” This would include questioning the value of vaccinations.

After the measles outbreak in 2019, the government quickly implemented an emergency vaccination program that was compulsory for the population. Kennedy's anti-vax connections on the island vehemently opposed this measure. The operation was compared to Nazi Germany.

> Tamasese called it a “killing spree.” He declared the vaccination operation “the greatest crime against our people” and suggested the vaccine itself was the cause of the outbreak. Tamasese advocated against the use of conventional medicine and antibiotics and urged people to rely on papaya leaf extract and vitamins instead of the vaccine and antibiotics.

During this time, Kennedy wrote to the prime Minister, *and he encouraged Samoa officials to examine the measles vaccine to 'determine, scientifically, if the outbreak was caused by inadequate vaccine coverage or alternatively, by a defective vaccine.'*

Kennedy and these anti-vax voices were pushing the idea that the vaccine itself was responsible for the deaths during the outbreak.

The Samoan government declared a state of emergency, and pushed back against prominent anti-vaxxers.

> Soon after that, Kennedy wrote a blog post for the CHD site that called Tamasese a “medical freedom hero.” He referred to the 2019 blast of measles in Samoa as merely a “mild measles outbreak” and praised Tamasese for having “infuriated the Global Medical Cartel.” He suggested that the vaccine, along with lousy hospital protocols, had caused the deaths. 

So yah, he's a piece of shit. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. 

While to this day, he continues to deny his involvement and his responsibility in the Samoa tragedy, and he still spreads this same kind of anti-vax rhetoric around on social media and whenever he gets the opportunity to voice his dangerous, misinformed opinions during right wing broadcast appearances.

Again, this is the guy Trump is appointing as secretary of health. Let that sink in. Imagine this scenario I've laid out for you, but on a national scale.

RFK Jr. is the least qualified for the job, we've been warned that a second Trump presidency is going to bring about a crisis of incompetence at every level of government.

Trump and his allies have already outlined a plan to first eliminate the independence of most government agencies, cleanse these agencies of anyone who is not on board, then put them under the direct control of the president and an executive with newly granted unilateral powers and broad immunities.

By doing this, they can install loyalists into positions of power once reserved for non-partisan and educated experts in their respective fields. They'll target the FDA, the CDC, the EPA, all public health related agencies, and may even try to eliminate them altogether. This is how said ""crisis of incompetence"" emerges, and with the end goal being the crippling of the separation of powers and checks and balances that hold our democracy together.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

">“I look forward to working with the more than 80,000 employees at HHS to free the agencies from the smothering cloud of corporate capture so they can pursue their mission to make Americans once again the healthiest people on Earth,” Kennedy said.

If Trump's minions (Musk & Ramaswamy) have their way that will be 20,000 HHS employees if there is even a HHS department left. And sorry to break it to people, the US has never been the healthiest country in the world. Yes, we should be healthier but lets not paint the US as a once idyllic eden that has only recently been corrupted. We have had a long history of being middle of the pack when it comes to overall health compared to the rest of the world.",2024_11_16,05_24_51

"""what about Fauci!?"" Is not a good look...

This has nothing do with Dr. Fauci.

It's actually quite telling. Because much like you're doing right now, Donald Trump, his allies and MAGA loyalists have been desperately trying to vilify and scapegoat Fauci for *their own* failures and ignorance. Often relying on outlandish narratives, conspiracy theories, whataboutism, and fruitless investigations to deflect from Trump's mishandling of the pandemic and the incessant efforts from Trump supporters to politicize COVID. 

While it's really emblematic of the contrarian, anti-intellectual, cynical and conspiratorial ideology that's become increasingly part of the Republican/conservative zeitgeist.
