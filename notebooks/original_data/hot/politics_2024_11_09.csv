States Rights!  Doesn’t Trump believe in states rights over the federal government or is it only when the federal government can’t do what he wants?,2024_11_09,05_18_26

"What he should do is two fold. First, do away with the commission that creates their congressional maps, and gerrymander that state to the point where it sends a single Republican and essentially gives control of the house to the Dems. Then, wield its economic influence as the 5th largest economy in the world, and tell the administration it'll start to withhold it's tax funds and not send it to DC to support the red states. Then get New York on board with both and bend the federal government.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"My running list:

This is what Gavin Newsom has been up to the last two years…

10 Bilateral Climate Change Agreements:

•	⁠5 with China to phase out fossil fuels
•	⁠2 with Australia on water and wildfire
•	⁠Mexico on clean trucks and recycling
•	⁠Canada on Flood Resistance
•	⁠Sweden on Green Innovation and Investment

Recruited 19 states to continue the Clean Air Act regardless of federal intervention

- CA, CO, CT, DE, MA, MD, ME, MN, NV, NJ, NM, NY, OR, PA, RI, VT, VA, WA, DC

Struck deals with the following Auto Makers to continue to move towards electric regardless of federal intervention:

Ford, VW, Honda, BMW, Volvo, GMC, Toyota, and Nissan

Partnered with Stellantis through 2030 (previously only through 2026) to maintain contracts in the case that the California Air Resources Board is unable to enforce their restrictions.

He additionally:

Codified the benefits from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Developed a natural disaster relief fund in case FEMA resources are pulled.

Stock piled millions of doses of Mifepristone and Misoprostol in case of a federal abortion ban

Bolstered restrictions on automatic fire arms and enforcing background checks and gun control.

And thanks to this cycles PROPS we have an additional:

- $10B for school repairs (Prop 2)
- $10B for lead removal from water and fighting wildfire (Prop 4)
- ⁠$35B over the next 4 years to cover the federal funding of MediCal if Medicaid is repealed (Prop 35)

Some may point to the deficit. Still working on that research but from what I can tell the $68B deficit can easily be addressed and stems from the postponement of 2023 tax filings that shielded the states financial visibility, for lack of better wording. The world’s 5th largest economy can move to self sufficiency if it needs to.

Additionally: Rob Bonta who has been preparing legal push back on everything from abortion to immigration since the overturn of Roe v Wade. The state has dissected Project 2025 and have rebuttals at the ready to slow and stop everything that can come out of it. Do not mistake this funding request as them just getting started. Newsom and the rest of CA started these contingency plans two years ago.

Saw a quote today somewhere from someone stating that the governors office is ready on a scale of 90/100 and will be 100% ready by the time he is in office. They have been working this for a long time.

Really glad to be CA Resident this week.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"yeah this is what every white liberal I know seems to think. and I'm not trying to be a dick, but like do you guys talk to people of color? because if you did, in my anecdotal experience you would be overwhelmingly likely to meet Trump supporters of Asian, Hispanic, Indian, and Middle Eastern backgrounds. you won't find a ton of Black conservatives or Native American conservatives for fairly obvious historical reasons. but the other groups don't have the same history in America as those two. while there has been racism in America towards every non-white group, new immigrants don't really know about the struggles of previous groups, and they don't really identify with the struggles of immigrants from their same group from decades ago. 

so what you end up getting is people who were pretty socially conservative in their own countries coming to a new country and seeing that there is a liberal party and a conservative party, and identifying themselves as conservative still. or even if they weren't conservative at home, they feel more at home with the current Republican brand. they don't see Republicans as inherently racist. most of the countries that these people come from are actually significantly more racist than America, and they're quite racially homogenous as well so racism isn't really a talking point. 

what ends up happening a lot of the time is they see people on the left talking about race, a concept that they don't really care about, and feeling like people on the left are just whiners or making a big deal out of nothing or some version of that. they also see people on the left supporting LGBTQ people, which isn't really popular in a lot of the countries that they come from either. so they don't really identify with that. 

in a lot of these countries, there's a history of either socialists or communists promising left-wing economic reforms, and then becoming corrupt leaders who basically screw the people over. this has the effect of making them wary of people on the left, and actually more likely to trust people on the right when it comes to economics. even though in America people on the right definitely don't have their economic best interest at heart, they're primed to trust the right more than the left.

remember also that the largest groups of American immigrants aren't coming generally from other highly industrialized nations that have been highly industrialized for centuries, like in Western Europe. those places might be more sympathetic to the American left because they have a similar history and their own version of the modern liberal Democrat. these people are primarily coming from India, China, Central and South America, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe. these places have distinct histories that are very different from the history of the US and Europe. most of them have a strong history of strongmen in their politics, so that's nothing new to them. fairly corrupt governments that don't really get a whole lot done are nothing new either. the line between professionalism and personal for their leaders is something that's been blurred for them their whole lives, so they don't really see someone like Trump as an aberration like we do. 

I know this was a long comment but it's such a common misconception that I see so often, and it clearly helped us lose this election. immigrants are not inherently liberal nor Democratic. stop assuming that they are. in fact, statistically, start assuming that they're conservative. you will at least be more realistic than you're being right now.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"I own an eco friendly business in AZ and we did pop-ups/farmers markets in a very red part of the state. The difference in the type of people that came out to Farmers markets was visibly and verbally noticeable.

After Trump got fired by the American people we started to see way better sales, the Trump paraphernalia dwindled pretty quickly (until the let's Go Brandon shut started), and people were beginning to be genuinely kind again.

Just that man being on TV 24/7 and especially being in office causes the worst people in this country to come crawling out of the deep dark caves they call home like cockroaches coming out when the lights turn out, and they all feel empowered to be the biggest piece of shit they can because Daddy Trump is mean to people so I can be too.

I voted Harris because the alternative was… Trump. This was a very clear choice between insanity and rationality. I don’t have to agree with every one of her policies to vote Harris. I just have to value competence and sanity. 

Fuck this shit.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
">or voted for Trump because of Gaza and other reasons

There are not enough words in my vocabulary, not enough time in the day, or enough imagination to tell those people what depth they need to fuck themselves.

Gaza cannot be helped if anyone remotely sympathetic to their plight for moral or political reasons has zero influence. Period. And to really drive that point home, Netanyahu sacked one of the few influential voices of reason and restraint in his government *the moment* he saw the direction our election was blowing. ""Biden didn't do enough"". No, he didn't. But there's a difference between telling Netanyahu, ""You will not use 10K kg bombs on civilian centers"" to ""here's a blank check, do whatever the fuck you have to do, do it quickly, we literally do not give the concept of a shit. Btw, Jared has some awesome ideas once you've cleaned out the vermin.""

""Gaza""...is no more. Period. The volume of people being forcibly ejected from their homes has dramatically increased, is not abating, and those who can't leave are going to die as the area is bombed to rubble. If people are unhappy with what a restrained, wrathful Israel looks like, they're going to be unpleasantly surprised at what a completely unrestrained Israel absolutely will do.

So, not only did those people basically bring in the Nazi Party Pt 2: We come in the Name of Supply Side Jesus, not only are those protest voters going to find out the hard way they are right at the top of the deplorables shit list, they get to watch the death warrant they signed for an entire region and its people play out in real time.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

It seems to me that most real meaningful collective action to improve society for the common person was stamped out with violence and murder in the late 60s leading into the early 70s. We have made some gains with regard to workers' and human rights since, but we are about to lose most or all of those gains to a theocratic hypercapitalist dictatorship which will evolve into a Russia-Style Plutocratic Kleptocracy with none to stop Trump and his admin from implementing Project 2025. And a majority of the electorate fucking voted for it, because they're convinced things can't get **much** worse, and that Trump will look out for the common man and save them from rising prices. The propaganda machine has so far effectively shielded Trump's supporters from realizing the reality they voted for, but it will hit, and they'll blame the Dems. I don't expect there will be any reaching them, even as Trump verifiably makes their lives worse and our country weaker on the world stage and a more dangerous place domestically.

We'll go back to the early 60s in some cases, and before that in others - hell, I expect a fair portion of what is to come to be downright medieval, considering the shit he talked about using the military on his political opponents, among other similarly horrifying things, which his supporters dutifully ignored or cheered on without a second thought. That's what Making America Great Again is all about, and these people will have to support it - they've given up too much to this man and this movement to leave his congregation now. They will support this administration, No. Matter. What.

Watch out though, Trump might just have to become a dictator and destroy the Federal Government and our way of life as we know it out of spite because the condescending liberal elites are talking down to people by telling them that's what they fucking voted for.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

So even if we protest the dastardly things the Trump administration does, the chances of him deploying the national guard, army, local militias on the people are going to be extremely high.

"I wrote this Wednesday morning...

Amy went back to her ex, because he said all the things she wanted to hear. She's sure he won't abuse her this time.  Even though he hasn't exactly apologized for the last time, she's sure this time it will be different... He promised candy and flowers every Friday.  He told her that nobody will ever love her the way he does.  He told her that he is the only one that can keep her safe.  He also said all that last time. 

Amy went back to her ex,  even though when she broke up with him last time, he got furious... He coaxed and cajoled.  He stomped and bellowed. He ranted, and raved claiming all sorts of wild reasons why she didn't have a choice... that she had to stay with him.  He wouldn't leave the house on his own.   The cops were called and a huge scene played out on the lawn in front of the neighbors.  The court cases are still pending from that disaster. God, that was so embarrassing... but memory fades and now she hardly even remembers the screaming, the bruises, or the blood, or the feces...  she's sure the last time was the last time. 

Amy went back to her ex...  even though he used the joint bank account to pay for all the nights he took his buddies to the strip bar.  She just can't seem to recall all the times that he gaslit her, telling her that what she saw with her own eyes wasn't happening right in front of her...  she doesn't remember him flirting with other girls right in front of her,  whispering in their ears,  sharing her secrets with them. 

Amy went back to her ex...  Even though he was golfing for most of that year she was sick in the hospital.  Even though he bullied and dismissed the doctors that were trying to help her.   He said he knew better than they did.   He said he ""did the research"".  She still hasn't physically recovered from the ordeal,  but this time surely it will be different. 

Amy went back to her ex...  because he told her that her body is hers to control...  she doesn't remember that last time he said the same thing... until she made a decision he didn't agree with.   She doesn't recall how he took choices away from her children on how to live their lives. She doesn't believe that he sees nothing wrong with how he conducted himself the last time.  She does't remember the narcissism.   She doesn't remember the tantrums.  She doesn't remember the vindictiveness.  She doesn't remember how he bullied her friends, and drove them away, destroying her relationships. She doesn't remember how close he is with people who want to see her fail.

"> A substantial amount of 2020 Dem voters stayed home this time.

They arent done counting votes, for one. California has only counted 58% of their votes, for example, and the counties that take the longest are urban areas. Kamala isnt going to win the populat vote, sure, but its not nearly as bad as people are saying. 

Secondly, in 2020, a lot of people stayed home AND voted, because temporary measures were enacted to allow people to vote easier and safer due to the pandemic. Those measures were then killed by the GOP when Democrats tried to make them permanent. 

Thirdly, Kamala is already the 3rd most voted for candidate in US history.

Every time democrats lose, you see months of why democrats suck, why democrats deserve to lose, why everything bad is their fault. Have you noticed that you never see that message from the GOP? No right wing outlets blamed Trump for losing. Conservatives on social media werent accusing each other of being bad citizens. You only ever see it from the left.

Purity before marriage has moved from being a religious and conservative thing to a measure of “body count”. As if the worth of a woman is diminished with more sexual partners.

Many came from South America and, having made that perilous trek, will go into deep hiding.

His second term will be a revenge tour. Don't doubt that. He already has all of the checks balanced in his favor. He is going to instill his people everywhere and make good on the promises he made towards specific people and groups of people.

You think of Donald Trump's campaigns and you immediately think of the border wall (even if it's a dumb idea). Kamala did not have a single policy that she drilled home as being uniquely hers. When cornered into talking about policy, she would ramble and deliver some over-stuffed word salad that only confused listeners. She was a bad candidate with no vision for change in an election where radical change was what voters wanted. Her main pitch was having Republicans in her cabinet and running with Liz Cheney to show bipartisanship. It was a terribly-run campaign.

I genuinely wonder how many in the BIPOC and working-class communities who identify as Republicans voted for Trump, despite policies that often work against their own interests. Consider this: Democrats are the ones who pushed for essential programs like affordable healthcare, government subsidies, food stamps, subsidized childcare, overtime pay protections, and union rights. If these resources help you and your family, wouldn’t it make sense to want to preserve them? What will happen when cuts to these programs hit those who depend on them?

And for Christian conservatives supporting him: how does that align with your values? He’s openly profited from selling Bibles made overseas, has a well-documented history of infidelity, and has associations with morally corrupt figures like Jeffrey Epstein. Where is the alignment with faith and values?

For Latino voters, I wonder: Did resistance to seeing a woman in the White House play a role? Were voters in this community fully aware of the issues at hand? Many Americans, across demographics, lack knowledge of fundamental topics—tariffs, government branches, the longevity of Supreme Court appointments—that have real impacts on their lives. Are there memories that short that they don’t recall families being separated, and kids being put in cages and took years for some families to be reunited if at all? Really! 

It’s critical to ask: how informed are we, and how much do we know about how our votes impact us and our communities? Too many vote based on personality or misinformation, and it’s time we start thinking more deeply about policies that shape our lives.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Stop playing victim and hold an actual democratic primary without shouting down half of your potential voter pool next time.


Stop taking PAC money in exchange for policy positions. Actual represent the people who show up at the polls.


The dems need to make actual changes to how their platform is presented. Hammer the economy the entire time, and propose a concrete tax plan to address income inequality.

If the dems can put forth an actual charismatic human being that is passionate about those 2 things, they could easily shave a few million votes from the post-trump MAGA coalition.

The visuals of doing things working class people do and like, along with some lip service to their profession and some light fearmongering, matter more than quietly doing things that actually benefit them.

In an election decided by the economy, conservatives have convinced blue collar workers that record profits will result in higher wages for them, even as the things that result in record profits put their benefits, jobs, and even lives at risk, while the vast majority of increased profits go to management and the C-suite. Pepper that with the secret spice of being against whatever the current social issues are, and you have a winning formula for making the workers and their employers happy.

Prices went up because corporations in every industry realized they could raise prices to recover from economic losses during the pandemic and never lower them for record profits, and there's nothing the consumer can do about it. But because one side did not hammer that point hard enough, the strategy that won the people over was something that will only raise prices further, but was presented like it would punish other countries instead.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

They often just quickly cut them, which leads to the very distinct impression that party doesn't genuinely want to pass them. And it's hard to avoid that impression when they're getting campaign donations from the very same corporations that would be against those initiatives.

What they need to get better at doing is putting up a fight. Brings things to a vote even if the vote will fail. Get everyone on record who votes against things like minimum wage increases.

Instead of down payment assistance how about building hundreds of thousands of millions of homes and selling them or renting them at cost?

>While Harris was stuck defending the Biden economy, and hobbled by lingering anger over inflation, attacking Big Business allowed her to go on the offense. Then, quite suddenly, this strain of populism disappeared. One Biden aide told me that **Harris steered away from such hard-edged messaging at the urging of her brother-in-law, Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer.** (West did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) To win the support of CEOs, Harris jettisoned a strong argument that deflected attention from one of her weakest issues. Instead, the campaign elevated Mark Cuban as one of its chief surrogates, the very sort of rich guy she had recently attacked.

She lost because she refused to throw any bones to the progressives who were begging for an excuse to vote for her. 

She wouldn’t budge on Palestine, she wouldn’t discuss healthcare for all, she wouldn’t talk about trans rights, she wouldn’t distance herself from Biden’s wildly unpopular policies, and she adopted the right wing policy on the border.

"What specifically are Democratic politicians failing to do, that Republican politicians have been doing?

Dem led states typically have higher minimum wage, more worker-oriented labor regulations, and more policies to help the poorest families. What do Republican led states do for their people?

At the federal level Biden passed what little he could with the gridlock that is federal government, with a heavily split congress. He passed the infrastructure, CHIPs and inflation bills (all bipartisan, but with many more votes from Ds than Rs) that have and will continue to create jobs in industries that we need today, and will continue to need into the future. The impacts aren't immediately visible, but ought to have a lasting positive jobs and economic impact. It wasn't something that helps everyone today, but I don't see what he could have passed that would have done that.

I understand that Trump's messaging was likely better received by more people in tougher financial situations, than Harris's, but I don't see how he's actually going to help. Stripping regulation may make some things cheaper, but it's not necessarily going to be better for workers in impacted industries. Stripping regulations helps the wealthiest businesses and investors more than anyone else. Removing taxes on tips and overtime sounds nice, but unless there are equal cuts to the budget, there is going to be a lot more deficit spending which is a bad long-term solution. Tariffs could cover some of the budget deficit, but they will increase costs, mostly impacting the poorest people, and may possibly further decrease spending, which would limit their ability to balance a budget, and could have recessionary impacts.

This exact thing happens countless times throughout history during a country’s largest changes - swinging wildly left or right toward progressives or fascists. 

In 2016 (and 2020) the left-wing party purposely demolished their populist, and the right wing embraced theirs. 

The voters sent a clear message this week - “we want change and we don’t care how it happens.” They’re gonna get what they asked for this time, and frankly it’s the Democratic Party’s fault for thinking that the best way to convince people that things were gonna change was by installing their own choice as the presidential nominee - the woman who worked for Joe “nothing will fundamentally change” Biden.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Media that is essentially 'peer-based' in contrast to traditional 'top down' broadcasting.

The GOP clearly came out on top when it came to using those channels to build enthusiasm for Right wing messaging and perspectives among the demographics that ultimately caused enough of a swing to deliver the election.  If it wants to compete in 26 & 28, the Left needs to play catch-up.

"There are many good podcasts with a left leaning tilt.  The difference between top podcasts and good podcasts is just popularity with the audience.  One thing that makes the current crop of right-wing populism more appealing is that they're not constrained by honesty.  They can just lie and say what they think people want to hear without worrying about whether it's true.  They can also scapegoat minorities, which turns out to be broadly popular but isn't really something that left leaning podcasts can emulate and still be left leaning.

During Trump's first term, there were some ""dirtbag left"" that experimented with indulging in some of the same tactics as right-wing podcasts, but it didn't have as much appeal.  And some of those hosts were extremely disingenuous about their politics as some of them have come full circle and are now pro-Trump.  They may have even been plants intending to bring their audience on that same journey from left-wing to right-wing, but even the most charitable interpretation is that their politics were very superficial to begin with.

I don't listen to a lot of podcasts, but one that I like is Behind the Bastards.  It has a very distinct left leaning viewpoint and is entertaining, doesn't pull its punches, and offers opinions backed by factual research.  It's not exactly small and obscure, but nowhere in the same league as something like Joe Rogan.  It's something like around the 150th podcast in number of listeners.  But I don't think the main difference between it and something in the top 20 is necessarily quality.  If audiences like hate and lies there's only so much you can do to accommodate them without just becoming right wing yourself.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

You ask yourself 'why is Joe Rogan so compelling?'

And, hopefully, you realize that it's because all those listeners view him as an equal.  A 'non-elite' (however you want to define that) who is trying to figure out the world just like they are.  And you use that lesson to replicate his approach to political engagement.  Instead of leaning on politicians to spew rehearsed talking points in news interviews, you build your own media ecosystems, and eventually communities, around common ideals that fuel real conversations and drive popular, digestible policy.

This is close, but two corrections. 1) There is no longer a Republican Party, they may choose to try to wear this mask, but this election demonstrated clearly that the MAGA coup of the GOP has been completed. 2) MAGA voters are told that the reason money is going to the rich is for the opportunity for it to trickle down. The policy makers and the wealthy know that this is just a lie to convince them to vote for them. Consistently, the money given to this class is hoarded or used to enrich themselves only. There are no extra jobs created, there are no new business ventures created. Overwhelmingly, the money that is funneled to them is used for stock buybacks and CEO bonuses. The difference is actually that MAGA politicians give the money to themselves while telling lies to their constituents about their plans for the money and providing convenient out groups for them to blame the ""missing jobs"" on.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"The main thing I’ll rush to disagree with is the idea Democrats wouldn’t clamp down on immigration. A little-known fun fact to both the Left and Right is that Obama deported more immigrants than all previous Presidents combined and Biden is on pace to deport the same number as Trump did in his 1st term.

The idea that Democrats are soft/friendly on immigration is and has always been a lie coming from both parties.

But yeah, tariffs were a Democrat policy for a very long time and they *did* protect American manufacturing jobs. Republicans are the ones who got rid of them, causing the downward spiral of working class life in the first place, as it made unions essentially powerless when companies can simply ship manufacturing jobs overseas to exploit cheaper labor and sell the products back to Americans at higher profit margins.

Bringing them back does sound like a great idea to people who don’t know any better, but with no existing domestic manufacturers (or at least not enough) to replace the products being imported, it’s going to cause costs to skyrocket and I don’t trust the union-busting billionaire class pushing for this shit to actually bring high-paying manufacturing jobs back to the USA anytime soon. But I’m probably preaching somewhat to the choir here, since you already said they’re not good ideas that will do anything for the working class.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
You don’t educate them. You need to dumb down the rhetoric. This is why Trump’s messaging is so effective.

>While Harris was stuck defending the Biden economy, and hobbled by lingering anger over inflation, attacking Big Business allowed her to go on the offense. Then, quite suddenly, this strain of populism disappeared. **One Biden aide told me that Harris steered away from such hard-edged messaging at the urging of her brother-in-law, Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer.** (West did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) To win the support of CEOs, Harris jettisoned a strong argument that deflected attention from one of her weakest issues.

"Pretty soon you're going to have to have a boring haircut and boot cut jeans to try and stay out of trouble.... If you're white man.

White women, best you grow your hair out and buy some dresses that go below the knees.

If you're any other color, you better get your papers in order and keep them on your person at all times. If you've got an accent, you might wanna work on that. 

All it's going to take is that one nosey neighbor calling the hotline before you got ICE and/or the National Guard knocking on your door. They'll probably haul you and yours off and ask questions later, but if you're lucky, those papers might buy you some time.

If you're a naturalized citizen, just know they can take it from you, get convicted of a felony and you can lose it. What will they charge you with? Being queer, taking birth control, watching porn (Project 2025 in full swing)... Or maybe just sedition because you voted for a Democrat.

Go ahead, try and fight it, lawyer up, if you can afford it. Hopefully they're allowed to visit you in the concentration camps they're going to have to build to house all of these ""illegal"" immigrants. Luckily ICE is known for it's meticulous bookkeeping, there's no way your lawyer will have trouble figuring out where you are in the first place.

My suggestion, if you have means and connections, get your go bag ready now. Those lucky few will be able to get out at the first sign of trouble. They'll spend the rest of their lives dealing with the guilt of those they left behind, but at least they survived.

Say conspiracies and completely outlandish things so much so that people lose track of what's fact or fiction or what's true or not.

They’ll repeat this process of revising the deal to “please” all parties, knowing they’ll never get agreement. In the end Trump now has the political cover within his party to cut all involvement we have in the war leaving Ukraine and Europe to deal with Russia. Over time the US will pull back sanctions.

"So we're definitely on a pretty Hitler-esque trajectory, but it's still uncertain who is going to be the most comparable to Hitler. Trump is obviously the dictator attempting to take over....but his willingness to hand over actual power to others is a bit different than what happened in Germany.

And it's totally possible that Elon Musk could actually be the one who ends up being the new Hitler.

Imagine Elon doing to the US what he did to Twitter -- the random changes to things he doesn't understand that result in widespread outages and breakages, the arbitrary bannings of people who displease him or his friends, the constant threats to compel obedience, the pointless removal of vital features and the introduction of poorly functioning new features that nobody asked for, etc...

...and now imagine that happening in a system where, instead of a website going down or throwing error messages, millions of people are suddenly unable to buy food or get medicine. And instead of being able to revert a change or force a few engineers to work 36 hours straight to tweak a few lines of code to fix it, it takes years to rebuild and rehire and retrain thousands of government workers.

The government isn't a website or app. You can't fix it for everyone by pushing an update. There are people who don't have internet access who will die if they can't get certain services within a certain timeframe. And if the current agency suddenly disappears and they can't find an alternative in that timeframe (either because there isn't one or because Elon broke it and then threw out some half-assed replacement that is only accessible to people with paid Twitter accounts or whatever), the bodies are going to pile up by the day.

And if Elon gets involved in the deportation/concentration camp portion (and there's no reason he wouldn't -- Trump has him talking to Zelensky which has nothing to do with his proposed role, so I suspect Elon will be involved in anything he cares to be involved in), it will be an absolute catastrophe. Elon Musk would *100%* order the deaths of millions of people (69 million people? Nice... Lol), and/or fuck things up so completely that millions die from starvation, disease/medical causes, sanitation failures, and all the other stuff that will happen if camps holding millions of people get the ""I am confident it will be available sometime next year"" treatment.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

how long until Trump and Musk are at odds because they each think they're running the other? I give it a year. No way in hell Trump will tolerate Musk for 4 years,2024_11_09,05_18_26
"This is a real question. One of the platforms Trump ran on was no mandates for electric vehicles. Elon is the CEO of Tesla … I feel like that kind of mandate would have benefited him. 

So, what’s going to happen there? Trump created more monopolies with his policies than anything else. I’m sure everyone is seeing all the retailers and “Big Box” stores go out of business. Eventually, we’ll be beholden to Amazon for certain things. I think the unique creativity of our culture is doomed—we’ve been sold out by the tech elites. 

But I digress. So, the whole idea is to heavily tariff China on autos, which include affordable EVs. Ultimately, that just keeps the competition low for Musk and he can charge more for Teslas. The average American isn’t going to buy a car like that anyways. 

I just don’t see an end game in this. Maybe Elon doesn’t care as much about Tesla. I know he’s going to push self-driving cars, which just seems like a solution to a problem we don’t have. Like people can call Uber and whatnot. Is he hoping to create a taxi service to replace driving vehicles? 

And if they continue to take away these kinds of jobs, who do they expect to buy this shit? Like that’s the part I am so fucking confused about. Americans are already strapped.

>While Harris was stuck defending the Biden economy, and hobbled by lingering anger over inflation, attacking Big Business allowed her to go on the offense. Then, quite suddenly, this strain of populism disappeared. One Biden aide told me that **Harris steered away from such hard-edged messaging at the urging of her brother-in-law, Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer.** (West did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) To win the support of CEOs, Harris jettisoned a strong argument that deflected attention from one of her weakest issues. Instead, the campaign elevated Mark Cuban as one of its chief surrogates, the very sort of rich guy she had recently attacked.

Trans in sport pissed off a lot of people including women and young voters. The message of hate was very easy for GOP to deliver. I know a lot of people here will disagree but I think something like ""no trans women in women's sports"" would have been a worthy sacrifice so that the GOP doesnt get into power and destroys trans rights altogether.

They have to figure out how to appeal-to and court the vote of people who are uninformed and easily swayed by simple messaging. In my town there were signs every where that said things like ""Trump Low Crime, Kamala High Crime"", ""Trump low taxes, Kamala high taxes"", etc. and I guarantee you that kind of smooth-brained messaging had 10x the impact than the nitty gritty details about their policies.

People will say ""I voted for Trump because of the economy"" or ""I want lower taxes"". But these people cannot articulate a single specific fact about Trump's policy that would lead them to believe he will be better for the economy or lower taxes. Even if it were true - and economists predicted his policies would be better, people wouldn't actually know that.

The real reddit ""echo-chamber"" is this notion that esoteric policy details are the ""real culprit"" when the reality is that 95% of people are completely clueless about all of this. 

The vast majority of people are uninformed and always will be. The perceived ""importance"" of the election here and elsewhere on the internet doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things.

The right has made political hay out of trans issue and successfully pivoted away from gay marriage to trans people as the new cultural bogeyman… and I think it’s more effective in part because a) gay marriage opposition was always more based on disapproval than outright fear and b) there are wayyy more gay and lesbian people, so the average voter might actually know a gay person and be like “well Steve is an OK guy, I guess I don’t care if he gets married”.

Detailed policy proposals don’t matter to anybody but the minority of really well-informed and often well-educated voters.

"New Zealand is screaming out for teachers, nurses, dentists, doctors and other professionals. We are also protected by Gandalf who keeps us off most world maps.

<edit>. My post is as a New Zealander who doesn’t work in immigration. Google will provide better advice than me (I’ve never had to immigrate here). “Immigration nz”, “healthnz”, “ministry of education”, “dental council” may all be good places to start. If you want an idea on costs for cars or houses “trademe” is our version for eBay for that sort of thing. Jobs are also on trademe and “seek.co.nz”. Most will say you have to have your immigration sorted before hand.

"Millionaire Democrats are lining up in droves to leave the US following Donald Trump’s [historic presidential election win](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-showing-early-signs-of-winning-election/).

According to a high-net worth investment consultancy, the number of enquiries about leaving the country had increased fivefold in the 24 hours after the [election result was announced](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us-election/presidential-election-2024-harris-trump-latest-results/).

Dozens of celebrities have said they would consider emigration if Mr Trump won a second term, including Sharon Stone, Cher and [Barbra Streisand](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/barbra-streisand-love-will-survive-tattooist-of-auschwitz/).

The most popular destinations for millionaire expats are Canada, Australia, the UK and New Zealand, the consultancy told The Telegraph.

The claims come despite Kamala Harris’s policy platform, which threatened higher taxes for Americans who earn more than $400,000 per year.

Arton Capital, a consultancy that helps rich clients move countries and seek citizenship, said it had received five times more enquiries than usual about its services on Wednesday and Thursday.

Armand Arton, the company’s chief executive, told The Telegraph that most of the potential clients were motivated by “ideological and emotional factors” after Mr Trump’s win.

“What we’re seeing is some people that have definitely done their homework before, who are just pulling the trigger now and trying to find the best providers,” he said.

“The phone calls we’re getting are from zip codes in Connecticut, New York and Los Angeles, blue states on the map, after the election results.”

"In the short term, the U.S. economy is poised to thrive. Deregulation and tax cuts will improve business profits, allowing the wealthy to gain more wealth and influence. However, without adequate safeguards, another economic bubble is inevitable, and our government—deeply tied to corporate interests—will likely bail out large companies once again. Meanwhile, ordinary Americans, already experiencing a modern-day Gilded Age, will bear the burden. Many voters, seeking easy solutions to complex problems, may fail to grasp the underlying issues, keeping us stuck in a harmful cycle.

The need for a balanced Supreme Court is more pressing than ever. Yet, with potential retirements among current justices in the next 2-4 years, a conservative majority could dominate for the next 25 years, further enabling government corruption. This court has already demonstrated a troubling willingness to undermine its role.

It's likely that they'll pass massive amounts of voter suppression laws and/or stay in office past the legal terms - in which case he'll keep appointing conservative justices and bring it to a 7-2 majority for 40 years.

"Harris lost ground *across the country.* There is no counting error that would swing the election back to her.

I'd be skeptical if it were one or two districts that made the difference, but she lost *double-digit* points in stronghold states like New York and Jersey. Pretty much *every county* voted to the right of where they were in 2020.

This is just sour grapes. The Harris campaign failed to win over voters, failed to articulate convincing, materially beneficial policies, and failed to listen to and engage with the working class' anger at the institutions and the status quo.

That's why she lost. The party needs to stop looking for excuses and buy a mirror. Neoliberal centrism is what lost this election. ""Diet Republican"" vs. ""Republican Classic"" doomed appeals to suburban conservative voters is what lost this election.

Stop blaming everyone else. Stop coming up with conspiracies. The party needs to change, and that doesn't mean moving *further* to the right. We need to stop running the same old status-quo Obama-era campaigns and rebuild the 2016 Sanders coalition.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Because machines are cheaper, faster, and more accurate?

Think of it this way: it used to be that banks handled every check by hand, transcribing the numbers, looking up accounts, and moving the physical checks about to a clearinghouse every day to move the right checks to the right banks.

You know what they don't do any more? Handling any of that by hand.

Votes are the same way. They run all the paper ballots through automatic counters and get quick totals. Then we do double-checks.

The biggest issue with elections is that they don't happen very often, so many of the people doing the counting and tablulating and reporting are new at the job. And like any newbies, they make mistakes sometimes.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Yes there is. It's not the first time. And it was imminently predictable. Those of us on the left have been ringing the alarm bells for years.

Harris' campaign was a failure. It failed to mobilize the votes it needed, and it took the 2020 pandemic year votes for granted.

You're angry. I get that. So are a lot of people. You need to turn that anger into something productive rather than turn it into delusion. Start organizing at the local level, and start fighting against the DNC running this same kind of campaign again in 2026 and 2028. That's the **only** thing that is within your power to do. It's gonna' be a lot harder to do under Trump, but you don't get the luxury of a choice in the matter.

What do Democrats do about that?  All this hand wringing as if putting anything on mainstream news media would have reached the people it needed to reach.  Sure there are always things they could have done better, but I honestly don't think we are focusing on the real problem and instead pointing fingers within, which is exactly what they want.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

A lot of what we see as progressive social policies were put in place as a counter measure to communism. The US wanted to establish that their system was better for workers than communism.


So what happens when communism falls?  - There's no longer an reason to maintain those polices as a counter-argument. Instead politicians and the wealthy act like whatever condition workers are in is what their condition is supposed to be - after all, this is the unrivalled ""better system"". The wealthy consolidate wealth, and when people complain they're told to shut up. Look no further than Russian itself - in the wake of communism it became, like most post-Soviet countries - an oligarchy, a kleptocracy.

"The nation came out with an article recently about how it shouldn't be left or right, 

But pro or anti systems+institutions 

The American quality of life has been spiraling downwards for decades, long before inflation. Housing, Healthcare, and Education inflation has been bonkers. 

It's not the only paradigm to view this loss, there's always multiple factors. But I think it's an important one. 

There is surprisingly a lot of carry over between people who donated to Bernie and people who donated to Trump.

Bernie and Trump's rhetoric do share some elements. That shit is rigged, and they're going to tear down something. 

Kamala Harris has a very strong impression of being an institutionalist. Someone who would fight for institutions, not tear them down. Of course Kamala was talking about the type of institutions that literally hold our nation together and get rid of criminals. But that nuance was lost. And to be their credit, Kamala is very institutional. 

When Kamala was younger, she protested against the death penalty. As CA AG, she fought for it, despite being widely unpopular in CA. 

It can't get anymore institutional than that. 

Kamala had very little time to campaign. She only had 3 months vs Trump's 4 years. Every second counted. And she spent a whole effing day of that entertaining the VISA CEO at her house, amidst the DOJ bringing an anti-trust lawsuit against them for gouging small businesses with fees. 

On domestic issues, I was a fan of Kamala. But even I knew that she was going to work within existing systems, rather than do something bold like what Obama did with healthcare. 

And to be honest, Biden did some institutional rawamping himself. Lina Khan. em effing Lina Khan! 

If I was in a coma and learned about Biden's accomplishments but told me it was Bernie who won and did them, I would have believed you. 

Even though Biden won, he was smart enough to realize it's because of Obama being the de-facto leader of the democratic party and Biden only won due to Obama's involvement. Biden knew that the people really wanted Bernie, and so he did everything he could to implement his domestic agenda. 

But he marketed himself in a way not to spook conservative voters, instead of marketing himself to those desperate for change. 

But a non-college educated white guy isn't even going to realize this. All they saw was Biden supporting institutions. 

Also, i have say that Gaza probably painted the impressions on what Biden and Kamala would do on domestic policy. Though Gaza was not a high priority on the vast majority voters concerns, I can imagine that if Kamala and Joe can't stand up to a ginocide, how are they going to standup for others with no voices? It may explain why 30 polls found that Kamala would have gained 5-6 points in all of the swing states, despite Gaza being a low priority for voters. 

In 2028, it'll be Ron DeSantis, who would probably also be seen as an institutionalist as 2x gov of Florida. But so would Gavin Newsome, and for the midwest, Gavin would probably be seen more of the institutionalist.

"We are never going to learn from this experience and come out stronger. Trump won for the same reason Biden won in 2020: the vast majority of working people are desperate and stretched so thin financially there is literally nothing else that matters to them.

In 2020 we were in the thick of the pandemic and people were feeling a personal economic crunch that hadn’t been felt in more than 80 years. 

A lot of politically literate and engaged people assumed Biden’s win was a rebuke of Trump and a sobering up after seeing how much he botched his term. It wasn’t that. It was desperation for someone new coming in and helping workers make it to the end of each month without constant anxiety and desperation.

Now here we are with exactly the same voter response for the same reasons and absolutely nothing systemic has changed or will change to help working people get a fair shake.

In four years we will likely see another swing back because people will once again be hurting and they will be looking for someone to bail them out.

FWIW, getting off the pro-immigration bandwagon would also be a return to the progressive policies of Cesar Chavez and Barbara Jordan, both of whom understood that allowing big business to import millions of vulnerable people -- to replace its ""uppity"" domestic labor force who dare to demand higher wages and better working conditions -- is no different than bringing in scabs to undercut union workers. 

Bernie Sanders was once honest enough to admit that. But he caved, and that means that this time around, Trump would have crushed him, too, no matter how hard it is for reddit to believe that.

I know that Democrats keep telling themselves that being all-in with regard to immigration has nothing whatsoever to do with stagnant wages (or rising housing costs, etc.) and then whining about how the pro-worker policies of the past have been forgotten.

Once we started recovering, we had to deal with inflation, but we've got that under control right now and our economy is doing well.  Gas prices are back down, and jobs are being created.

> Falsehood will fly, as it were, on the wings of the wind, and carry its tales to every corner of the earth; whilst truth lags behind; her steps, though sure, are slow and solemn, and she has neither vigour nor activity enough to pursue and overtake her enemy...

Or, ""A Lie will travel halfway around the world while The Truth is still getting its boots on"".

Conservatism is a liar's creed. It's what they do. The entire premise of the movement is ""we can make things like they used to be,"" *but they can't* because time only moves in one direction. The only way you can convince people that you'll bring back ""the good old days"" *is to lie*. And people will *swallow that shit* like it's free ice cream, because it's what they *want* to hear.

The root of the problem is that very many people are very, very dumb. That's as politely as I can put it. The base human instinct is to *avoid* change, because change takes effort, it takes energy, there's the risk of failure, and the outcome is unknown. It takes a very concerted effort to overcome that. It takes a certain intelligence, a certain maturity, and a certain awareness to sit with our emotions and go, ""this is scary but it needs to be done"".

And the truth is, a lot of our peers just *do not have* that capability. They will hide from responsibility, avoid change to their own detriment, and the moment someone comes along and says ""don't worry, I won't ask you to be better,"" they've found a new messiah.

Which is all just a very long-winded way of saying this is a fault of the *people*. Not the candidates, not the media, but the people who vote for them. The thing is, I have no idea what the solution is. An absolutely massive push to increase education spending is the only thing I figure has a remote chance. Fund public schools to the absolute gills.

"Copying from another one of my comments - social media in theory could help decentralize and democratize media, but in reality the systems that have been built are just as easily if not more easily manipulated by special interests. They can hyper-target their messaging and create information bubbles that are even more extreme and one-sided than the polarized mainstream media, and all the more effective because it's paired with the ""social proof"" of seeing it repeated and amplified by people in your own network.


And the social media platforms have no real incentive to build their systems any other way. Polarizing ""rage bait"" content is what drives the most engagement, which in turn generates revenue. In the short term at least, they all stand to benefit greatly from the status quo of information silos, extreme partisanship, and outright disinformation.


One would hope that eventually the people in charge of these platforms would realize the immense harm they are doing to society and implement changes to reverse course, even if it's purely out of cynical self-presevration with the ever increasing risk of genuine societal collapse.

If that's corect then his loss in the primary doesn't necessarily reflect the fact that his base wouldn't vote in a general election.

The way I see it, in a general election, he would have been begrudgingly accepted by some democrats as ""at least better than Trump"", happily accepted by others, and brought out a significant amount of voters who typically don't vote democrat. Remember that he was *endorsed by Joe Rogan*; that indicates support from a segment of the population which the likes of Clinton and Biden will never see votes from.

He went with one thing and made it stick in people's heads. And it's a positive thing.

That's all that needs to happen. Keep it simple, something that sticks in people's heads. Basic *marketing*.

Funny thing, Harris seemed like she was on a similar path. Her nomination speech was really good... and then things slowly trailed off over time. If the campaign just put her on air repeatedly and talked about her plans to help middle class people, it probably would've worked out. 

Instead, they pivoted to ""we're not Trump, and we have a large coalition of people, including Republicans who reject Trump"". Great... that's not really a message of action, it's, again, ""we're not the other guy"".

Democrats are still treating politics like politics, when in reality, I'd wager that the average American can't grasp much more than a popularity/name recognition contest. It's about *marketing* - and *that* has been Trump's *entire* life.

There’s good reason for staggering and good reason for small states going first, but ultimately we want the candidate who can win the most swing states to be the nominee.

"I'm baffled at how so many people take issue with Sander supporting the Democratic nominee, something he's done in every election. Harris wasn't taking advice from Sanders, she was taking it from the likes of Hillary. Her campaign, her choice.

Sanders supports the nominee and they lose: ""What a phony!""

Sanders stays in the primary but then supports the nominee and they lose: ""It's all Sanders fault!""

"It’s old history at this point, but Bill Clinton was once perceived as an insolent upstart that “cut the line” in American politics. 

Much of the Republican chagrin has to do with perceiving Clinton “stealing” HW’s second term away. 

So by the end of Clinton’s administration, where he was pretty darn popular and has weathered strong GOP smear campaigns - the DNC was *his*.  The wagons had been circled. The Clinton’s were to be protected. 

That party control never went away. It was on display in the famous Obama/Clinton primary with the superdelegates that basically had to rebel to back Obama. 

And Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The Faustian bargain that the party would back Obama as long as the Clintonites stayed in control of the DNC so she could run in once Obama’s “line skip” was done. 

That led to the congressional collapse in 2010 - the national party did not do a 50 state strategy. 

That led to the shenanigans of 2016 and the cold-block of Sanders. 

That brought us to the second collapse of  democratic wins in 2018 as well. 

Biden was different though. He didn’t bring in clintonites. He brought in Obama people. And we felt that leadership difference up through the first few weeks of Harris’ campaign. 

But by the time the Debate rolled around, it was Hillary Clinton’s former campaign behind the scenes running the messaging…and who was with Harris when she had to concede? Hillary Fucking Clinton. 

This family is the albatross of the DNC and is squarely responsible for all the compromises, broken promises, and two faced protection of corporate greed that has prevented the party from properly engaging the American population on class challenges and rural betterment - the things Americans actually want. 

Shit. Go watch Walz on the daily show a few weeks ago. He has a throwaway line about rural hospitals and talking about building them and how excited rural voters were for that idea. 

But was that the core message of Harris/Clinton’s people? Nope. It was assumption that voters would already back democrats, and that what we had was a “cool” problem. Just show democrats as being cool and chill vs republicans. 

Nah. Clinton’s get it wrong again. For 24 years. People don’t want cool candidates - they want people that will give them things. And say they will give them things. 

Clintonites never ever speak that way. Instead they promise to fix the problems republicans create, and then they only fix 40% of it…in cities, without disrupting finance, media, or tech (industries that Americans have been screaming to be regulated for 20 years).

But hey. Just don’t remember that Democrats gave you ma fracturing moving to Mexico and China, Telecommunications act of 1996, Digital Millennium Copyright Act, tech immunities for publishing, and were critical in the passage of both Patriot Acts and No Child Left Behind because hey - we’re a *bit* more inclusive than the Bible thumpers. 


I liked Harris. I think she ran as good a campaign as you can in 100 days…but come on. The party itself won’t get its head out of its ass on messaging, and now it’s too late. 

The party was traumatized back in the 90s, with gore in 2000, and has never ever recovered. Obama winning wasn’t the norm, he was the exception…and still struggled to deliver on promise outside of the ACA. ",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"The problem is the modern Democratic Party is essentially conservative. They think we’ve evolved as a society to a good enough point and they’d like to stop here.

The problem is that the modern Republican Party is essentially regressive. They think we’ve evolved too much a society and would like to go back, thank you.

The problem is that a conservative party has no way to stand up to a truly regressive party. The Democratic Party does not understand at an institutional level that the evolutionary social level they’re aiming for isn’t an endpoint unto itself: it is, by its very nature, a transitional period. You can’t give women, minorities, LGBTQ+, *some* rights in perpetuity. Eventually, you have to give them all of their rights, or none of their rights. The Republican Party has picked a side in that debate, and the Democratic Party is still whining about how life is unfair.

The only thing that can oppose a truly regressive party is a truly progressive party. Unless the Democratic Party wants to embrace some pretty radical leftism, it has nothing to offer the vast majority of its potential voter base.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"In my state of Queensland, Australia, with a population of 5+ million people, 1 person died of a locally acquired covid infection in the first ~one and a half years of the pandemic until vaccines arrived.

Everything was pretty much open and normal, and we had almost no mask wearing except for a week or two about three times that an infection was detected, where people masked up to get it under control.

The state government tracked down every case and quarantined them, with testing at the state borders and a quarantine period for non urgent travel (initially in hotels, then later at homes).

There was even a time where delta raced through a few schools in the capital city of Brisbane before it was detected, but they still tracked down every case and quarantined any contacts, and within like 8 days the state was back to normal.

>5 million people. 1 death from local infection. There's individual streets in the US with higher death counts than that.

The Supreme Court is probably going to un-incorporate portions of the Bill of Rights, that is the Bill of Rights will no longer apply to the states.

"Hell. It’s deeper than that. By the 50s and 60s our own government largely knew that the American people were too stupid to protect themselves from the kind of propaganda the 20th century had given us access to. That’s why we felt the need to brainwash our own citizenry through domestic propaganda during the Cold War. 

The Cold War eventually ‘ended’ and the propaganda machine was slowly dismantled, which left space for the media companies to fill in the void left by the lack of government-based, pro-American propaganda. The media companies invaded the American consciousness, and now we get to see first hand why our leaders during the Cold War feared the power of the media so much. It was only a matter of time until someone came along and took advantage of that media system to control the masses, and that seems to have been exactly what happened. 

It sure doesn’t feel like a coincidence to me that the chunk of people in this country who are functionally illiterate seems to overlap strongly with the parts of the country who voted Trump back into power. But sadly, this really isn’t the fault of those people. They are stupid and gullible and have been fed a steady diet of brainwashing and lies. The propaganda machine is more of the problem than the people themselves are.

"This is it in a nutshell. There are massive social media/radicalization pipelines for Dems to overcome, and people have short attention spans.

Because he gave them a clear brand and a clear enemy-rich corporations and the billionaire class-to channel their frustrations at. If you asked 100 people on the street what Bernie’s platform was, they’d give you roughly the same answer. Ask 100 people what Kamala’s platform was and they’d give you a bunch of answers and probably have trouble answering the question. 

A lot of Dems would go “but she gave a speech saying xyz about housing tax credits” and “she proposed this helpful policy!” and they are absolutely telling on themselves about not knowing what regular people or low info voters are like. Literally none of them are seeing that shit lol. You have to make your brand/platform sink in/break through for people who don’t closely follow politics and aren’t reading about them on Twitter every day. You have to make easily digestible, catchy, memorable pop song; not worry about making the best indie concept song with interludes and key changes. It needs to be accessible and easily memorable.

This type of a person can get through to people, because they have shared experiences. Someone who has struggled to put food on the table or struggled with seeing their rent go up so high they can’t buy their kids new clothes for school.

We also need to change decorum. The world is much more casual thanks to social media. One of the campaign slogans and chants should have been “They’re fucking weird! They’re fucking weird!” Or straight up chant “Weir-dos! Weir-dos! Weir-dos!” with fistpumps intro he air. I want to see super sarcastic, nasty ads that attack their weird behavior and weird gaffes.

You have a point. The conservatives got into power in the UK in part by promising lower immigration, instead they raised it to record levels. They need cheap labour to keep wages low and they need more people to compensate for low birth rates. People keep voting for lower immigration, and I suspect the right wingers in government even want lower immigration, but the practical reality is that for economies that have become dependent on them it will be deeply unpopular in the short term.

"> It will hurt their profits.

Yes, you're right. And yes, the guy who owns Mar-a-Lago is not going to do anything to curtail easy access to the quasi-slave labor he relies on to clean the filth from his golden toilets and wash the bronzer from his stained sheets. The same goes for Bubba who is always sputtering about them dirty illegals, but then heads down to the back of the Home Depot and hires Manuel and Raul whenever he needs a fence fixed or his lawn mowed.

But the fact that Trump will never live up to his rhetoric doesn't mean the rhetoric should be ignored, given its obvious appeal to actual workers that the Democrats are supposedly interested in. To keep ignoring that, as the Democrats do, means they're going to protect the workers whether the worker likes it or not. Who does that remind you of? 

Moreover, let's remember that the only one who wins from being all-in on immigration -- as Bernie himself stated, once upon a time -- is big business (and the slumlords). So why did Bernie and so many other Democrats cave in on that? If it was because of all the added Latino Democrats at the polls, it obviously didn't work this time around. Trying to turn purple states blue with an influx of immigrants is about as politically sleazy as the Republican approach of gerrymandering everything into surefire red districts.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"For what it's worth, Bill Clinton literally condemned the Hillary Clinton campaign for not doing more to appeal to the Rust Belt and rural voters. I think his exact words to the campaign managers was literally: ""Those are our people. Why are we not down there?"" He called it in 2016. The Rust Belt voted for Trump.

The issue is that the Democrats keep thinking that going high and talking policy is going to work against a populist demagogue like Trump. It won't. To many Americans, those actions are the same that resulted in their current disillusions with the system. That being said, the issue isn't the Presidency. The issue is the Legislative, which has been in a state of dysfunction I would say long before even Bill Clinton. They've increasingly passed their responsibilities and some of their powers over to the executive and we've had nothing but continuing resolutions for a few years now. America may not realize it, but their frustration isn't with the President -- it's with the Legislative; however, the Executive acts as a massive scapegoat FOR the Legislative (because it's easier to remember one person on top and focus all your blame on them versus a bunch of other Senators/Reps) and there is a weird practice where constituents don't blame their own Senators and Reps, they blame the others.

There has to be a greater outreach towards voters in those rural states, but they have to change up their tactics. Americans clearly don't care if you ""go low"". They want to be told there are solutions, even if it's a borderline lie because the status quo is not working for them. This is how demagogues like Trump get power in the first place as they tell people what they want to hear.

Additionally, they need to start holding the billionaire class to account and show the American people that they are. There are a few things that both Republican voters and Democrat voters actually agree on: the removal of gerrymandering, the removal of money in politics, protections for social security, etc.. They need to campaign on these, and if their donor class bucks or chafes at this, then they need to stop playing nice.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

The wrong lessons were taken from 2008. The longer we move past it, the more it seems to be written off as Obama just being an exceptional campaigner and arguably the greatest orator of our times. But while those things may be true, it was the message that got his foot in the door.

Disagree. Bush 41 got turned on by his own party because of raising taxes after declaring on public TV ""Read my lips: No. New. Taxes.""

What Republicans hated about Clinton is that he was a potsmoking draft dodger and represented *everything* they hated about the 1960s and 1970s.

The fact he later got elected twice *and* survived an impeachment (with THEM getting the blowback for the 1995 shutdown and then the failure to convict in his impeachment trial) just added fuel to the fire of their hatred. The perception ""America doesn't care about this"" really pissed them off after they spent *months* detailing everything he did with Monica and graphically at that.

This is, of course, the historical norm.

 - Biden fixed the economy after Trump crashed it during Coved.
 - Obama fixed the economy after GW Bush crashed it during The Great Recession.
 - Clinton fixed the economy after GHW Bush crashed it with the Crash of '87, the Crash of '89, and the recession of '91. 
 - Carter did not fix the economy after Nixon's wage and price controls. We had a spell of high inflation, because Nixon had gotten the economy so far out of balance.
 - Eisenhower's stated policy of periodic recessions to keep inflation down, got Kennedy elected.
 - Herbert Hoover shows us what happens when 3 Republicans get elected in a row: The Great Depression. It took Roosevelt a long time to fix that.

The standard model of the economy and politics is that Dems come to power after the Republicans start a recession or a depression. Democrats fix the economy by making policies that try to create full employment. When the vast majority of the country gets more prosperous, they fall for the Republican lie that Republicans are somehow better for the economy, despite 100% of the evidence being to the contrary.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

For anyone else reading this that is not a condescending statement, simply that some voters have a grasp of the gambit that includes more facets than the average bear has time to deal with and perhaps the freedom or professional responsibility to maintain that.

None of that would have stopped me from advising any candidate to go talk to people and meet them where ever they are, constantly, and that has not happened since 2008, and not so fortuitously, just as the housing crisis happened. The average bear has a short attention span; it is what it is.

Yet, when people feel or perceive pain and to add to that feel ignored or disrespected, or are of a generation seeking leadership and example and the only people that they perceive telling them that they have value are individuals with axes to grind and a fever for maintaining their own relevance, no mas.

"I'm not a Trump supporter, just analyzing here. 

Trump has a solid point of argument that can't be denied: Obama campaigned on stopping wars and closing gitmo. He left in 16 kicking the can on all of it, likely out of concern of the optics. 

Trump wins. Completed the negotiation and sets a timeline. Met with all the local stakeholders. Scheduled it for the next presidential term. Iraq and Afghanistan both.

Biden wins, sticks to the timetable, Afghanistan folds like a wet towel, as expected. People complain Trump left it for the next person to clean up. 

Trump pulls a Grover Cleveland, and gets to say: I wanted to go back to back like any other President, but why are people mad that Biden was stuck cleaning up the mess him and Obama promised to clean?

I hate the fucker, but goddamn that's a solid body blow. The numbers are plain to see in the state vote splits. Take Michigan for example: Trump has less votes overall than 2020. One Muslim mayor endorsed Trump, and the other said ""vote your conscience"". The result: Kamala lost at the top of the ticket, but Slotkin won her Senate race. I don't think misogyny played much part in a state with a wildly popular woman at Governor, who just literally sent a woman to the Senate. I don't think racism played much part in a state that solidly backed Obama twice.

Michigan didn't even become *more Republican*, the numbers show it became less this cycle. Michigan voted protest at the top and then regrouped D down ballot. Gaza was the wedge here with the Muslim bloc.

NC is even wilder. The black Nazi took a straight ass kicking almost 2:1. NC split the ticket: D governor and R President. NC, lots of bases, shit tons of veterans, a few who remembered Trump brought the boys home from the pointless wars. The DNC couldn't move the needle but again, Trump didn't make any mind-blowing gains, up less than 100k over 2020 so far. NC certainly didn't become more Nazi. 

This election was about wedge issues. Gaza. Inflation. But it's also plain as day that Democrats struggle to keep their coalition together too. The diversity of that coalition suffers from identity politics. I can't imagine what it feels like as a white guy to walk into that room and everyone in it already halfway cancelled you before you said hi. ""You're the literal worst, now vote for us"". I'm hyperbolizing but seriously, Pull a string between any 2 points of that round table and you've got some beef festering between 2 special interest groups who can't get along for 4 years and then attempt to broker a tenuous truce every election season. And all that's before you even get to ""vibes"", the GenZ tribute demand. End result: D is playing prisoners dilemma every cycle, and only when the pain is overwhelming do the parts form and actual megazord.

Meanwhile R voters stay gang gang, win or lose, consistent and predictable. ""We're all assholes over here, shrug, let's get this money""

">Perhaps the sentiments contained in the following pages, are not YET sufficiently fashionable to procure them general favour; a long habit of not thinking a thing WRONG, gives it a superficial appearance of being RIGHT, and raises at first a formidable outcry in defense of custom. But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts than reason.

That's from Thomas Paine's Common Sense - which I've often seen noted as key propaganda which led to the US revolution or at least to it looking somewhat like it did. That said, what we got was... Not entirely what Paine had fully advocated for at all. That bit I quoted always makes me think of MLK Jr's Letter from Birmingham Jail:

>I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, **who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice**; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection. 

Mostly sharing because I think you're right that it goes back that far and even further in some senses. The counter revolutionary ideal winning out in a way that let's the steam of the movement they're resting on to begin with dissipate isn't new.

And while we don't use the term Tory in the US at this point, I think Paine is 100% on point in American Crisis:

I really don’t like her but she was one of the only ones actually cutting through the BS during her time.” It’s baffling.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"You missed my point, but let's talk about yours. No one flips anymore. There are no real swing voters or independents. This country is full of people choosing between ""Do I vote for ""my team"" or do I not bother to vote""

Republicans have a reliable voting base of ~70 mil. Democrats have a reliable voting base of ~60 mil, the ""Blue no matter who"" crowd.

So what do Democrats need to do? They need to inspire, excite, and enthuse millions of voters to get up off their couches.

This year's message of inspiration, like '16, was ""If you don't, things will be bad."" People looked around and said, fuck, things *already are* bad, so I guess nothing changes.

There was so little policy or promise to the Dems platform that was ample enough to make people believe voting for them could make life good. 

$6k for having a kid? Thanks for the half off coupon, now we'll only pay 5x what other countries do.

Small business loans? I'm super happy the people with ""start a business money"" get more money, but that doesn't pay my rent.

Build more houses? Yay! More houses I can't afford that Blackrock will just buy and turn into forever rentals!

Etc. Etc. Etc. They needed the promise of transformative change on their ballot to even stand a chance against a guy screaming ""I'll fix everything, no more taxes!"" But instead of running the 2008 Obama campaign, they ran the 2016 Clinton campaign again, complete with bragging about all the war criminals, billionaires, and rapists that are on *their* side.

This is complete conjecture from one semi-informed jackass, but the possibilities for how this goes down are endless.

"I had a buddy that hosted Ted and his family on a tour of the studio he works at and his family was very nice and polite the whole time but seemed very uncomfortable the whole time. Ted was as fucking goofy and awkward as you would expect, it was like he was trying to live up to his persona and put on a show the entire day and his family seemed completely over his act and tried to distance themselves from him through most of the tour. 

At the end he wanted a family picture so my buddy offered to take it and Ted had him get in the picture with them despite my buddy’s objections. Ted had the attitude of “Hey, it’s no big deal, it’s completely cool, you’re not intruding, just come grab a photo with me and my family.” I guess he read it as my buddy being nervous and not wanting to bother a famous person, despite the fact he works with and meets them on a fairly regular basis, but in reality it’s because he thinks Ted Cruz is a giant piece of shit and can’t stand him and the entire day solidified those beliefs.

He said “It was a very surreal experience having to get a family photo with someone you despise and that person being Ted Cruz. I had to entertain him for most of a day, and did such a great job of being professional and hosting him, that he actually liked me and wanted me in his family photo and the end. It was maybe a minute or two but felt like an eternity as I sat here trying to accept that this was a real experience. I’m standing here next to fucking Ted Cruz because he wants me in a photo with his family but it was painfully clear that none of us wanted to be in it but him.”

I’m sure his family loves him in some way shape or form and if you actually know him as a person you could find some redeeming qualities but it felt like he hung onto to his persona because it’s all he really has. He sold himself out long ago and they’re all just going through the motions at this point.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

And this is the crux of the issue. It's not a message anyone is sending anywhere. The message all those ""I won't vote dem because of fucking palestine"" non-voters sent the message that whatever Trump does in that situation is just fine with them.

"I understand what you are saying, but I disagree.

If it turns out X millions of people fewer voted for a candidate this year than that they did last time round, I think it sends a message to that party.  

Sure, voter turnout can be a product of many, many factors.  But at the end of the day, your party needs votes to win.  Yes, it technically only needs more votes than the other side(s) - so you could get 50 million less votes than prior but if your opponents gets 70 million less, you still win.  But I like to think that still sends a message to parties/candidates.   Give people something to vote for. This time round, it often came across more as ""don't vote for the other person!""  vs. ""here's why we're actually a better choice"".  Give them something to run towards instead of just telling them who to run away from.

I do think people should vote.  

But I also think parties putting out candidates/campaigns that don't inspire people to vote for *them* is how they lose.

You can't just say ""Well, candidate X would have won if more people had just voted!"" because those theoretical voters may very well have voted for candidate Y.  

I suppose taken to an extreme (in America) you could vote for a 3rd party and if enough people did that it may have a bigger impact that simply not voting.  But that also implies you support the 3rd party candidate and their ideals/policy.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Here in the UK a smaller version of this happened with our recently evicted Conservative government. They drifted further and further to the right over the 14 years they were in power, shedding all their competent politicians as they went. In the last couple of years before being booted out they were talking about doing some pretty unpleasant stuff, but were so useless they couldn't actually do any of it despite having a large parliamentary majority (basically total control of all branches of government).

Edit: it did also mean they ran the economy into the ground and generally broke the whole country though. Having incompetent leadership is rubbish but it does at least mean they're just as shit at being evil as they are at being good.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"> Don Jr. said on Fox News that Trump isn't going to bring on ""anyone who thinks they know more than the duly elected leader of the free world"". Think about how baffling it is to brag about not bringing on experts because their ego is that fragile

This is why our covid response was so terrible. He saw first hand, people wanting to hear more from Fauci instead of Trump, so made sure we heard from him less, while also allowing MAGA to demonize him.

Like I am not even kidding as I was arguing with a Trumper yesterday on TikTok over covid. The Trumper was claiming that it was the democrats that shut down the country under covid. I tried to remind this person that Ohio shut down and was red state with conservative leadership in charge, the person doubled down on the comment saying that Fauci and the dems were responsible.

These people still think that when Trump was president that the democrats were controlling red states like Ohio and shutting them down. Despite that fact that everything that was done at that state level was led by DeWine. He was the one that shut down the state, he was the one that sped run the ability to collect unemployment benefits during the pandemic, etc.

It's so annoying that these people can sit there with their full chest and spit out lies as if they are factual and refuse to be fact checked at all.

Trump must be one terrible president that if he had control of the house, senate and the white house that a red state with conservative leadership was shut down by democrats who had no control over any branches of government at the federal or local levels. But this is the narrative these people want to imagine happened.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Billionaires had the best set up in the world and didn't even realize it due to their greed. Generational wealth in a country that respected the rule of law and defended their property meant that previously no matter who was in charge they and their family would keep their generational wealth. They could afford to not have personal relationships with the country's leaders and still keep that wealth. They could even freely criticize that leadership if they wanted to.

In a country that doesn't respect the rule of law at the hint of disloyalty or disagreement they can be arrested, have their wealth seized, or killed. 

At one point in time Mikhail Khodorkovsky was one of the richest men in the world but then he criticized Putin. Jack Ma is one of the richest men in the world but went missing for a notable amount of time after he criticized the CCP. Billionaires were included in the Saudi elite that Mohammed bin Salman held under house arrest and at gun point they had to disclose and give up wealth stashed elsewhere in the world. I don't know if Fethullah Gulen was ever a billionaire but he used his influence and media empire to help Erdogan consolidate power to move Turkey towards authoritarianism and then eventually Erdogan saw Gullen as a potential threat so Gullen had to live decades of his life as an exile in the US until he died. 

The billionaires in the US did not learn from any of this and seemingly do not understand that it is the government that uses its armed forces, police, and courts to protect their private wealth. They think themselves independent of the government but by having the most assets they are the most dependent on the government defending the rule of law and the current socioeconomic order. All they had to do was pay taxes on their income and they would forever remain the country's elite. Instead to hoard even more wealth they pushed the country toward authoritarianism and now they will need to constantly kiss Trump's ring and the ring of who ever comes after him in order to be allowed to remain as the country's elite. I also don't think Trump will like any of them being richer than him.

One of the biggest core beliefs of a conservative is supposed to be their desire to keep their current socioeconomic order exactly as is. Supporting coups and abandoning the rule of law should have been seen as incredibly anti-conservative, but over time they all convinced themselves that conservatism simply means supporting lower and lower taxes with no concern for stability and no fear that an autocratic would ever turn his unlimited power on them.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Whether they blame the dems or the republicans for Trumps demise, they won't accept that it was from natural causes because the republican party has allowed the lies time and time again that Trump is the most healthiest person who ever ran for presidency. So they won't be able to fathom that too was a lie from Trump.

There is no being above the government. 

If there is a military force that controls a territory then who ever commands that force makes the rules. If you're talking about a scenario where the country dissolves into complete instability and anarchy with no central government and military then warlords would spring up with their own smaller militaries grabbing as much territory as they can. Those warlords would be the new governments setting whatever rules they want over the areas they control.

It's possible the billionaires imagine themselves as successful warlords, but I can't image that life would be better than the one they currently have. Also if the current government falls into instability and anarchy they can say good bye to owning property and assets from coast to coast. Even if a billionaire did build a private force that successfully controlled some territory everything they formerly owned outside of that territory would be under someone else's control who makes the rules there. 

In short if they are on a private island what military and police force is protecting all the property that they own elsewhere and who is protecting the assets of all the companies they own stock in?

Inflation means two things. It really means one thing, but different groups of people understand it two different ways.

B) To the people clocking 'the economy' inflation is ""the rate at which the price of things increases over time.""

It doesn't matter that we more or less performed a miracle as a country by taming B without a massive recession.

The fact of the matter is that we didn't do anything about A in a timeframe that would help them out.

Now, we can argue that it wasn't possible to do anything meaningful about A, that Trump's messaging about A was simplistic and unrealistic, that his policies will make A *even worse* but **none of it matters to these people** because it hurts them and the incumbent party didn't help them.

Refusing to accept the results of an election is bad -- but all things are not equally bad, and I believe the consequences *of accepting* the results would be worse. And if I truly believe that, then I must speak up and try to inspire others to feel the way I do.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. **But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.**--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, **let Facts be submitted to a candid world.**

So far Democrat politicians refuse to escalate no matter what, because they don't want the opposite change from Republicans, they want their status quo back.

"Sorry, but this is all p\*ssy b\*llshit.  Blue states need to exercise our real power ->  $Money$

This is the only thing MAGA is going to understand.  Blue states are net federal tax donors.  Red states are the biggest federal welfare queens.  We need to metaphorically kick them hard where it hurts —in their pocketbooks.

Liberals keep trying to be generous, but all we ever get in return are their red fingers stuck in our faces.  Well,  guess what., we have much bigger $greener$ fingers.  They are hooked on our money like they got hooked on opioids.  And now it’s time for some tough love.

It’s called Blue Exit. (https://newrepublic.com/article/140948/bluexit-blue-states-exit-trump-red-america )  But I’m proposing something even more hardcore: 

 

1.      We all should call their member of congress and scream at the top of our lungs “Blue dollars for Blue States!!!”  We should push to decimate the Federal budget to its bare bones.  To pull this off we can make political alliances of convenience with libertarians and budget hawks on the Right. 

 

2.      Trump wants to impose tariffs that will skyrocket inflation?  Well, guess where most of the biggest ports are — California, New York, New Jersey Washington,… Blue States.  Well, we assert that ports in Blue States belong to Blue States!  And we are free trade zones.  Then Trump wants to send in federal law enforcement?  Well guess what, tariffs are really bad for dockworkers.  With the encouragement of state mandated hardship pay, they may want to go on strike.  Let's see how well the feds can run the ports.

3.      What's the nuclear option?  Citizens in blue states threaten to stop paying federal taxes. 

There's a lot more we can do, but you get the point.  This is a fight for our freedom.  Let's act like it!

Blue Americans have the biggest economies by a long shot.  Let's act like it!",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"The first step will be to cut federal aid to blue states, deny them any type of hurricane, earthquake or weather-related relief, give incentives for major companies to move out of blue states and have their headquarters in red states, etc. 

The second step will be to federalize all elections and enact strict voting regulations on the states. Taking away early voting, vote by mail, require Election day voting only, showing ID and maybe proof of citizenship as well, limit the hours and locations people can vote (especially in blue states and big cities which trend blue), have armed security or Proud Boys with guns manning the polling places, getting rid of Dominion machines and put in their own voting machines. This will depress turnout for reliable Democrat-leaning voters like Black voters and other POC.

20 Lessons from the 20th Century

Author: Timothy Snyder

  


Americans are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism, or communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. Here are twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the circumstances of today.

  


20 Lessons from the 20th Century

  


1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. You’ve already done this, haven’t you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.

  


2. Defend an institution. Follow the courts or the media, or a court or a newspaper. Do not speak of “our institutions” unless you are making them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions don’t protect themselves. They go down like dominoes unless each is defended from the beginning.

  


3. Recall professional ethics. When the leaders of state set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become much more important. It is hard to break a rule-of-law state without lawyers, and it is hard to have show trials without judges.

  


4. When listening to politicians, distinguish certain words. Look out for the expansive use of “terrorism” and “extremism.” Be alive to the fatal notions of “exception” and “emergency.” Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.

  


5. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Don’t fall for it.

  


6. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. (Don’t use the internet before bed. Charge your gadgets away from your bedroom, and read.) What to read? Perhaps “The Power of the Powerless” by Václav Havel, 1984 by George Orwell, The Captive Mind by Czesław Milosz, The Rebel by Albert Camus, The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, or Nothing is True and Everything is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev.

  


7. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy, in words and deeds, to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. And the moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.

  


8. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.

  


9. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes.

  


10. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.

  


11. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.

  


12. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.

  


13. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can.

  


14. Give regularly to good causes, if you can. Pick a charity and set up autopay. Then you will know that you have made a free choice that is supporting civil society helping others doing something good.

  


15. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state, looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many hooks.

  


16. Learn from others in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties here are an element of a general trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.

  


17. Watch out for the paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-Leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the game is over.

  


18. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional ethics.)

  


19. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die in unfreedom.

  


20. Be a patriot. The incoming president is not. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.

Middle/upper class - Likely to get a relatively fair shot. Can afford a lawyer and bail that isn't excessive. Not getting away with too much but not getting overly punished most of the time either.

Wealthy/ruling class - Can afford teams of lawyers and get away with just about anything, including murder.   Their lawyers know the judges, for the super elite like Trump they may have appointed the judges.

You wouldn't want the president to be charged and tried for those crimes while in office, is it would affect their ability to govern. However, this is obviously a huge issue as we found impeachments are voted on down party lines with Trump.

FYI: You can still be charged and tried for a crime that occurred prior to your term.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Look I hate Trump and think he’s a worthless sack of shit. That said, the people that voted for him won’t ever magically grow brain cells. Trump and republicans are the absolute best at playing “the game.”

When Trump’s policies start hurting the people that voted for him, they’ll do some king fu ninja mental moves to blame it on Biden/Harris for leaving Trump in such a bad position. 

And when nothing gets done while he’s in office, they’ll blame the stonewalling democrats who just won’t let them pass any legislation (even though they control all facets of government just like they did in 2016 and did fuck all then too). 

Republicans have been saying for nearly a decade they’re going to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something else. It’s a talking point all the dummies can latch onto because: “fuck Obama.” Of course they’ve replaced it with nothing and have presented no plans. But you got Trump saying l they have concepts of plans so I’m sure they’ll get it all sorted out.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

What the media has grossly failed on with Trump is talk about the important stuff. They mention it, but then the front page goes something odd he said or did, as if odd is more important that dangerous. I really doubt the US in general really understands how dangerous Trump is and probably won't know for years even a fraction of what really happens.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"> Why is no one talking about the fact that SCOTUS effectively eliminated the judicial branch’s check on the executive branch?

They did no such thing.  Congress is the only legislative body we have, and they can pass any law they like as long as it abides by the Constitution.  The judicial branch uses those laws from the Legislative Branch, to enforce what the Executive does.

What you should be actually mad about is how members of Congress abdicated their responsibility to legislate by passing enforcement to unelected bureaucrats all while becoming millionaires themselves.  That is what SCOTUS ruled on.  Your checks and balances still remain as they always have.  Congress got by without doing their jobs for decades and they got called on it.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Some break precedents but seem reasonable and not *illegal*. But often it’s literally not possible under the current legal framework…. And this guy, despite being at the top, doesn’t have the ability to change that framework like a ceo would at a company. I think a small portion of the problem we have nationally with the information voters and the average American have is caused by fundamentally not having a great grasp on how out government or legal system works *including the laws preventing certain actions*.

I think social media has reshaped elections the same way television did after 1960, only it's made things much worse, much faster. The post truth age began around 2010, and it's turned into utter chaos.

I think people who complain about 2016 are missing the point.

"So shortly after the whole thing went down, the Democratic House started impeachment proceedings. Since Trump was already on his way out, Mitch McConnell used that as an excuse not to complete the impeachment in the Senate. No meaningful reason was given, but we all took it to mean 'what are you gonna do about it?'.

So then came the evidence gathering step, which was stalled, blocked, delayed and hamstrung time and time again by Republicans in various House Committees who were tasked with gathering said evidence. Since its the House's job to do it, and those committees need to have representatives from both parties, the Republicans on those committees abused their power as much as possible that it took two entire years before the cases even started up in late 2022.

So when that started, then you had the legal system, which Trump is notorious for abusing by delaying progress as much as possible, with trivial procedural matters, by finding the absolute bottom-of-the-barrel lawyers he can find, who will endure censures from the court system for wasting their time, in his defense.

By now its late 2023, and suddenly the Supreme Court decides to step in. Trump's lawyers made the bold-faced claim that the President is immune to prosecution (like, at all, not just for official acts). Any reasonable person might think that this would be a tacit admission that Trump had done exactly what Jack Smith was accusing him of, and that he would only use this argument when cornered, but we'll just pretend to ignore that part. The Supreme Court looks at this absurd argument and thinks ""Yeah, sounds a bit dicey, and an important thing to discuss, so let's schedule that for 6 months from now, knowing that we won't have to provide a resolution until at least 2 months later, which is our typical turnaround time"". Weirdly enough, despite the extremely weak arguments put forth by the Trump legal team, who had to be coached through to providing proper legalese answers by the conservative Supreme Court Justices multiple times (something that *never* happens), they finally made their decision after 3 months of deliberation. Why the extra month? I dunno, I think someone lost some paperwork somewhere and they had to get new copies from Trump's team or something. You know. Shit happens.

By July the Supreme Court had thus ordered Jack Smith and team to go back to the beginning and decide exactly which pieces of evidence could be used in a new superceding indictment, now that they'd finally come to a decision that 'presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts, but we're not going to tell you what those official acts are, and make you do all of the work figuring that out, oh and if you do include anything in that indictment that we don't think is an official act, we'll have to intervene again. Sorry about making your workload so much bigger right now, but we're just really so busy ourselves'.

And so, months later, after finally being given his marching orders, and the Supreme Court had played defense for Trump and his legal team for the better part of a year, Jack Smith revealed his supersceding indictment. Oh, but wouldn't you know it, now we're stuck in election season and we *cannot possibly* accelerate the legal process, or strip away the will of the people, for this particularly unique and important case. Aw shucks.

"Okay, so I've been looking into this, because like most regular people I'm afraid of it happening, and also don't know enough about the rules to say that it won't, but as I now understand it:

The 22nd amendment very clearly states that a president cannot serve a third term. Changing the constitution would have to *start* with 2/3rds of both the house and the senate's approval—and that just can't happen unless everyone in America becomes a millionaire and at the midterms decides to get rid of every Dem in Washington.

Trump's fascist Supreme Court majority couldn't help him even if they wanted to, because it is their expressed purpose to interpret the constitution, not to change it. And there's no way to argue that the constitution itself is unconstitutional, and the language of the 22nd amendment is very clear.

Now, I should say that I learned all this from ChatGPT, so if anyone knows better, please correct me 😅 Trump will probably act like a child and refuse to leave, but unless he has the overwhelming support of American citizens (like, much much more than he has at this, his most victorious moment), it'll be a disaster and it will further degrade the office and this democracy, but he won't actually get a third term just by throwing a hissy fit.

If regulations on safety get cut to increase profits, the system will fall apart and stay down. If the savings are enough to make more than they did with a safe functioning system, they won't fix it without government regulations. This is how it will spiral. ",2024_11_09,05_18_26

">When a candidate for public office faces the voters he does not face men of sense; he faces a mob of men whose chief distinguishing mark is the fact that they are quite incapable of weighing ideas, or even of comprehending any save the most elemental — men whose whole thinking is done in terms of emotion, and whose dominant emotion is dread of what they cannot understand. So confronted, the candidate must either bark with the pack or be lost... All the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre — the man who can most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum.

>The Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal.

Also, for the most part babies more than a couple weeks premature typically died throughout history, and mothers often died in childbirth for a variety of reasons such as breech births.

You do understand that people who are against abortion are against it because they believe a baby is being killed. You can disagree with them but that’s what they believe and I think most people would agree killing babies is not a good thing. To those people abortion is probably one of the worst things happening in the world. Again you don’t have to agree but that’s how many people feel. They’re not looking at it from the perspective of a medical emergency. They just think it’s mostly irresponsible people having unprotected sex and getting knocked up. In fact I’ll go out on a limb with no evidence to support my claims that most abortions aren’t medical emergencies . ,2024_11_09,05_18_26
Maybe but I’m not sure that’s what’s happening. Also didn’t we learn anything from the toilet paper hoarding during Covid? I’m not sure how the production of abortion pills works but now there could be shortages and people who really need them won’t be able to get them.,2024_11_09,05_18_26
I don’t care. I think people should be able to do what they want if they’re not hurting anyone else. But it doesn’t matter what I think. There’s a large group of people who look at abortion as baby murder and to them that’s simply unacceptable. You might not agree with them but that’s what they believe. All the arguments have already been made in support of abortion and it didn’t sway them. That’s what they’re going to believe. It’s possible it was a factor in this election. ,2024_11_09,05_18_26

"No, they aren’t.  But those are the ones being banned in the “middling” states.

There was never a rash of elective late term abortions under Roe.  Roe explicitly didn’t protect that.  Every woman who had one of those “late term” abortions had things go sideways on her.  

And if it was about belief in murder, the laws would have exceptions for non-viable pregnancies.  But several explicitly don’t, as backed up by courts.

It’s also the “pro-life” groups that inevitably block measures that massively reduce abortions but allow choice.  E.g. Colorado’s BC trials.  64% reduction of abortions- not in those who participated, but the whole eligible target population.  Killed by pro-lifers cuz it let young women and teens decide if they wanted to be pregnant in the first place.  Apparently that’s worse?",2024_11_09,05_18_26

What we need more than anything is to repeal the 100-something year old law that sets the number of reps at 435. Based on population growth since then the number of reps should have at least tripled. Smaller districts would be harder to gerrymander.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"Precisely.

If we lose the House by 1 seat that is still way closer to winning it than losing it by 3 seats.

Maybe obstruction is what we need to keep the crazy bullshit from happening,2024_11_09,05_18_26
"I sympathize with that feeling. But I don’t think the opposition party ever really gets blamed for obstruction; the electorate apparently doesn’t think that deeply. They never seemed to blame Republicans for their total obstruction strategy during the Obama administration, and didn’t seem to blame Democrats in 2020 for obstructing Trump after the 22 midterms.

Rather, the risk is that being constrained by Democrats will cause people to believe that Republicans don’t actually want to do all the horrific things they’ve talked about.

All in all I think it’s better if Dems keep the House are able to prevent an atrocity-filled deportation of millions, a nationwide abortion ban, laws against contraception and trans healthcare, etc, and ruinous tariffs. But unfortunately I don’t think it will matter much. The Presidency and Senate is enough for the GOP to lock down the Supreme Court with a hyper-Republican majority for decades to come, and they’ll be allowed to do the heavy lifting on policy. At the very least they’ll open the floodgates to state level anti-sodomy, anti-contraception, and anti-trans discrimination laws. They’re also practically certain to almost entirely destroy labor, environmental, financial, and anti-trust regulation. And it could get much worse than that.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

If redistrcting could extract any more seats, Springfield would have figured it out. 

New York tried to do the same thing after the 2020 census and they came up with a 20-2-4 (D-Tossup-R) map. That was declared illegal per state law. Then *that* ruling was overturned and the maps were redrawn for this year. As of January, NY will have a 19-7 House delegation, which isn't *that* far from what the gerrymander was going to nab.

That’s our problem, guys. Too many of us think we can win by explaining to people how they’re wrong — and then we never win.

How do you win a chess game against a pigeon that shits all over the board and struts around like it won? You don’t play chess against it, you ATTACK it.

Always attack. Never defend. Respond to all attacks with counterattacks. Don’t try to defend yourself or explain. It takes some getting used to and goes against our instincts, but it’s literally the only strategy that will work. You’ll get used to it with practice.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Democracy fights a harsh rule in the game theory of its longevity. 

if anyone cheats, we all lose on net, democracy doesn't work as well.  If whoever cheats can be *mostly* stopped, but not totally, they gain advantages that stack up over time, and help cheat more. 

You can't start cheating right?, because we all lose when anyone cheats. But if you don't cheat, the cheaters just keep eroding the status further. 

If you can justify cheating because *they* cheat, can they not use the same justification to cheat too? *maybe* if both sides are cheating in the same way, they could come to an agreement to stop, but why? If one side gains an advantage, they wouldn't agree to stop. If neither side gains any advantage either way, why would they use any of their influence just to increase ""fairness"" for its own sake without changing outcomes? 

The conclusion is that Democracy enters a slow but spiraling trajectory of failure the very instant that the law is not equal and fair both in the way it's written and how justice is dispensed.

Housing

Education Costs

Mental Health Crises

If we can find similar figures of a leftist bent, I think we can reach a lot of people.

In particular, while there are certainly cult members for whom it's all about the racism and Christian nationalism and they are lost to us, I think we would really be missing the mark and hurting ourselves if we treated *everyone* who voted for him as having primarily those motives.

"Loose monetary policy in response to a once in a century global black swan event (Covid) caused a  ~22% inflation spike between 2021-2023, but was recently brought under control by the Fed since to lower than historic interest rates. 

People blame this 22% inflation spike on the sitting president, Biden, who inherited much of the woes caused by excess liquidity in the capital markets in the US. The popular government Covid spending programs added massive liquidity to the capital markets, as this added spending (like the zero interest rates, $1,400 checks to every citizen, and PPP loan programs during the tail end of the 1st Trump Administration that continued well into the Biden administration) took time to work through the economy. 

The economic effect of government/Fed intervention is always measured long after the “fixes” are initiated, as it takes time for the gauges to see the results to show up in our inflation readings (inflation is classically known as a Lagging Indicator). We have yet to see the full effect of the Biden policies on inflation as the IRA and CHIPs act are just starting to get underway.

We will never see prices go down to pre-Covid levels, this is not how inflation works. This concept,  deflation, would be considered a very rare isolated event that would only happen in extreme over-supply or under-demand situations that never last long in any market. The government intervention on tap with the next administration (broad tariffs) will also become extremely inflationary and likely result in reduced available supply. This will effectively raise prices on most household necessities we import from foreign countries that are targeted with tariffs.

Banks know what will happen, they are already raising mortgage rates (long term loans) to cover their risk, even when the FED has just started to lower interest rates (inflationary)!!! 

We are at the beginning of a perfect economic storm. Basic economics, buckle up fiscally and batten down the hatches, shit is gonna get dicey in the next fiscal year.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Trump's plan to deport immigrants will crash the economy.  It's estimated to cost nearly a trillion dollars, and I'll be shocked if it doesn't end up costing far more.  That's a trillion dollars gone, before any of the other reckless and expensive things Trump promised to do, such as tax cuts for the rich.

Inflation is going to soar, again.

Who will do the jobs immigrants are doing?  They're jobs Americans don't want.  In order to get that work done, companies will have to pay significantly more, which will push prices sky high, especially food prices.

If you don't already have an emergency savings built up, do that now.  Don't make any big purchases.  Save as much as you can.

I'll be shocked if the coming crash isn't much worse than what we saw in 2008 and 2020.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"Inflation is currently around 2%, which is the Fed's target rate. It's that low because of policies put in place by the Biden administration.

"There was no plan for the except to make the wealthy wealthier

Trump was president during a pandemic. The economy was upside down with millions of people out of work. 

Biden and his office restored what economy we have . He brought us back from a post-pandemic economy, where millions were out of work. Did corporate greed pay an enormous part and inflation absolutely. But they think a carton of eggs and a head of lettuce is expensive now.

We’re in for a world of hurt if these tariffs go into effect.  And I feel bad for the gullible people that think that he is going to restore any type of job market and industry.  

The political realities from how the younger generation voted that will shape their future. Growing up in the digital age, they’ve been influenced by viral content and memes, but this often overshadows the deeper understanding of issues like tariffs, economics, and government institutions. 

For instance, when politicians talk about 50% or 100% tariffs, many young people mistakenly see it as a discount. But in reality, tariffs raise prices for consumers, hurt working-class families, and don’t necessarily bring back jobs as promised. They also fail to understand the long-term impacts of their votes—particularly when it comes to issues like the Supreme Court, reproductive rights, LGBTQIA+ protections, and government programs.and climate. They espouse they support these communities, but their vote definitely did not reflect it. 

Many in Gen Z also lack basic civics knowledge. Ask them about the three branches of government, and they might struggle to answer. Without this foundational knowledge, how can they understand the stakes of their votes?

It’s easy to vote based on who seems “relatable” or “cool,” but policies matter more than personalities. Elections have real-world consequences, and if Gen Z isn’t careful, they may find their rights and freedoms slipping away due to uninformed choices. It’s time to move beyond memes and social media culture and take a hard look at how their vote will shape the future.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"*Trump’s tariffs. The proposed 20 percent across-the-board increases would be massively inflationary: a 20 percent increase on the retail price of all imports and imported components.*

The thing about inflation is that it disproportionately affects the poorest/those on low wages/fixed incomes such as pensioners. 

People who are relatively well off will suffer but having a higher level of disposable income they can survive. 

It seems a lot of Trump voters were from lower wage groups who had been hit by what is global inflation and blamed Biden. They probably liked Trump's protectionism, they are going to get clobbered hard by a trade war.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Trump won the election because:

A) the democrats didn’t have a primary, and their main strategy for the longest time was to gaslight voters and tell them their own eyes are lying to them when they were concerned about Biden

B) Biden has very low favourability, and they decided to run his VP who refused to differentiate herself from him. At times saying she would literally do nothing differently, and telling the concerned working class that their fears were unfounded and actually the economy is doing great. 

C) when voters desperately need change, dems main messaging was: “You need to vote for us because republicans will destroy democracy, also, if elected we will work closer with republicans than any dem administration before and give them a voice in our cabinet. Now, here’s Liz Cheney!” 

Dems know how to grasp defeat from the jaws of victory. Their out of touch leaders are experts at it. Doing any of the above things could’ve won them election, but it would’ve upset their donors. 

Do you guys know anyone who did well among certain demographics like… Independents, Young people, minorities (especially Latino men), and “bros”? 

Like I’m not saying they needed to run Bernie, he’s ancient at this point, but they could’ve at least brought him out to stump and rally their base instead of Cheneys and billionaires. Just so cluelessly out of touch. They could’ve at least lied about wanting to change things, universal healthcare, or campaign on anything promising change. Very few working class people are getting hyped over means tested small business loans 

Instead of shifting their messaging, guess what they’ll do next election cycle? They’ll shift to the right, and pretend the issue this time was that they went “too woke”. They’ll do anything to avoid campaigning on policy that is popular among their base and American people (like universal healthcare). They’d rather lose and be right than win. Everyone here in this sub will cheer on as they do the exact same mistakes, refusing to put any pressure on them so that they might change and actually stand a chance of winning, and you’ll all be even more shocked next cycle when you’ve lost even more minorities and young people to the right.

2020 was a fluke due to Trump fumbling peak Covid and everyone having mail in ballots. A corpse could’ve beaten trump at that point in time. Dems are grossly incompetent and are insanely lucky they even got a 4 year break. Keep pandering to those “rational republicans” maybe you’ll eventually get those 17 votes you spend 100s of million on trying to switch. It really is as easy as simply as: acknowledge the issues of the working class (don’t deny them, call them stupid, and say everything’s okay), give them someone to be angry at (the rich), and promise change",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"*We are at the beginning of a perfect economic storm*

Being a boomer, I've been through several downturns.  The last was due to Covid.  I have an account that has just now gained back what it lost in 2020, took four years.  2008 was another downturn, took several years to gain back what was lost.  

Dot com bust.  I remember losing big time there (1/3 value).  The early 1980's was wild.  Interest rates of 12-18%, depending on what you were borrowing the money for. I didn't ""lose"" anything because I didn't cash out, I had time to let it come back.  I don't know if I have that time available anymore.

Now this.  I couldn't sleep the other night thinking about how much my account was going to drop.  I can pull it out, take a small hit on the cash-out, a large hit on taxes and move that money into CD's.  Not a good financial move.  This would guarantee a 1/4 loss.   

I discussed the issue the next morning with my wife and we're setting up an appointment with our adviser to see the true cost of a withdraw.  We will have to then see how much we're willing to lose if everything tanks.  I expect at least 1/4 value, but I could be wrong and lose 50% or more due to the sheer scope of things that's coming.

This is what MAGA wants.  A lot of MAGA people ""don't have a pot to piss in"" and would like to see those that do, burn.  My family has both ""rich"" and ""poor"" MAGA's.  The rich ones would love to see non-MAGA suffer financially, and the poor ones are all going to get rich one day, but until then, they don't have any money to lose.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

**Medicare for All Act of 2019**

-H.R. 1384 	February 27, 2019 	
-S. 1129 April 10, 2019 

**Medicare for All Act of 2021** 

-H.R. 1976 	March 17, 2021 	


**Medicare for All Act of 2022**

-S. 4204 	May 12, 2022 	

**Medicare for All Act of 2023** 

-H.R. 3421 	May 17, 2023 	
-S.1655 	May 17, 2023 	 

Obviously there's a ton of dems who would fight against those bills, but 100% of republicans will block any attempts. So it's kinda clear who is to blame. 

Also, the dems in 21-22 and the Biden administration also passed a bunch of stuff that helped working class people, for things like food and energy costs, housing and rental, medication costs, job creation, etc. They have done waaaayyyy more for the working class in the last few decades than anything the repubs have done.

"Here is the difference. Biden has a specific goal to protect American competitiveness and abilities in EV tech.  Like it or not, it's coming and will be the next economic race.

Trump is a blunt instrument. He levied tariffs not understanding the actual reasons to use them, how they work, or what the consequences can be (he still has no idea).

His tariffs last time shuttered the soybean farmers, raised lumber prices (so housing prices) and was on the edge of a recession when COVID hit.  That actually masked the fact that the bond rates had inverted and that is a strong sign of a coming downturn... Then COVID hit and it got lost in the noise.

Biden can't just repeal the tariffs Trump made.  Well he can, but once in place it takes a trade deal for both sides to ease off the protectionist crap.  That hasn't happened because China is fine with a trade war it knows we are not in position to win.  So we are stuck with them now and with dipshit back in office he wants more.

Last time he slowed the GDP all by himself relative to where it was headed before his ""help."" If he gets his 60% plus tariffs on China and 10% everywhere else it will crater the economy on a level not seen since the great depression.

\- She's guilty of inheriting Biden's unpopularity. He's guilty of rape. She's clearly at fault.

\- Her record as a public servant elicited skepticism. His failed insurrection elicited none. Dems clearly need to look in the mirror.

\- She refused to go on Joe Rogan's podcast. He mimed blowing a microphone. Easy to see why she lost votes and he didn't.

\- She's young and fit and vibrant. He's old as shit and clearly losing his marbles, rambling incoherently at cult rallies while people stream for the exits. Deep introspection clearly needed on the left.

\- Her career was spent serving the people. His was spent defrauding the people, stiffing contractors, bankrupting casinos, and laundering money for the Russian mob. Dems clearly dropped the ball.

>And judging by the discussions already being had among those responsible for this failure — with the Biden whisperers at Morning Joe calling for the party to turn even further away from progressivism, and Third Way’s Matt Bennett insisting, despite Tuesday’s result, that “the one way to beat a right-wing populist is through the center” — he’s right about something else: the interests behind the Democratic Party aren’t going to learn a damn thing.

but I'd argue that our two major parties do need to represent the center -- just not the fake center of two extremes that we've been force-fed by decades of manufactured culture wars and classist lies. We need both parties to reinvent from the grassroots to represent a true choice between the best of the best of the basic fundamentals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness on which we all agree: healthcare, housing, and livelihood, not the lesser of two evils.

Nobody listened. Not the media, not the voters, not even the left-wing voters. They (we) were too focused on being outraged at each other to pay attention to who has been helping for several years and who is going to help them going forward.

"I see a lot of comments that can simply boil down to ""blame the voters"" . Yes, true, it is the fault of the voters that Kamala lost the election.

However, Democrats have done a very poor job of understanding the voters they need to capture to win elections, which is Bernie's point.  Most voters don't follow logic, they follow emotion. Many don't even vote in their best interests, and that is especially true for those who voted for Trump.

The problem is, Dems still believe that logic should work in convincing these people to come to the other side. It doesn't.  Nobody cares that Kamala's economic plan received A+ ratings from economic scholars, they DO care that Trump has promised to lower grocery prices and bring things back to the way they were.

The democratic strategy essentially boils down to telling these people they are wrong about the way the feel, and the way they view the world. It doesn't fucking work.  If they simply used rational thoughts, they would surely understand that Democrats have all of our best interests in mind, correct?  Nope

Democrats have their hearts in the right place, but they don't know how to talk to or empathize with average American's in the way that Trump does, even if Trump is dishonest about it. Democrats try to win minds, but it isn't a battle of the mind, it is one of the heart.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Trump offered nothing but scapegoats like immigrants and trans people for dumb people to hate, but it works great.

 If the democrats want to win an election they need to ACTUALLY HELP THE WORKING CLASS by going after the CORPORATIONS AND BILLIONAIRES and redistributing wealth. They’ll understand when their wallets get fat. When they can afford a groceries and a car. Corporate Dems like Pelosi, Hillary, Biden and even Obama will never do this, and they will never win another election.  The corporate wing of the the democratic party needs to go the way of Jeb Bush and Dick Cheney.  We need someone outside the establishment who will actually go after the real problem. And its not immigrants. Its Big money, lobbyists and corruption and megacorporations. TAX THE HELL out of them. Then use that money to help rednecks in middle America afford groceries.

 I know a guy who used to talk about this a lot but they wouldn’t let him win and now he’s 84. Bernie should have run third party in 2016 and spoiled the election for Hillary, and made it known that he would not back down until the corporate democrats burned.

Kamala Harris acted like most Democrats. Useless civility, Biden is great despite his unpopularity, and never acknowledged that something is fundamentally wrong with this country.

It doesnt matter how many times they say “ackchyually, the economy is great!” When everyones cost of living has been skyrocketing. That message doesnt resonate with people that are paying 40% more for rent and groceries. The “economy” that they generally refer to is the GDP and stock market, that most of these people dont benefit from. There are record corporate profits, with a background of massive layoffs across all industries to preserve these profits. People are justifiably angry with the current state of things, and Democrats offered absolutely no alternative. 

They hear the statements from RFK and Elon about gutting everything and fill in the blanks with their imagination, reality be damned.

Takes that suggest the fault is at the voter level to preserve the status quo to give the D’s even more time to pretend to try to figure it out isnt going to convince the millions that didnt vote for her to vote for the D’s next time.

You “get that the democrats shit the bed,” but then immediately lament that only if MAGA wasn’t so insane we wouldn’t have had to worry about how much the Harris campaign stank. It fucking stank. She appeased the right and the status quo and people are super fed up with the status quo. She had a chance to bring younger progressive policies that have MATERIAL benefit to Americans - a thriving wage, public healthcare, and a just plan to transition our economy from fossil fuels to renewables that is also unapologetic to those that think it’s American culture to roll coal and drill baby drill. 

The Democratic establishment is going to keep listing to the right and that is my concern. They’re doing to worry about being called communist or socialist. Guess what? The right is going to vilify democrats no matter what and they’re going to do it consistently no matter what.

Even given that most dems have been beholden to these corporations, she veered far right, courting the Cheneys, including Dick who a decade ago many of the same establishment touting him now were calling a war criminal.

But you're never going to outwing MAGA. And even if you somehow did, they'll use their cognitive dissonance to say how it's socialist anyway

Continued support for - and denial of - a genocide, from us who are supposed to be *for* basic human rights. And calling people against it foreign agents even while most democrats were against unconditional aid, because it was the financially optimal thing to do. It's so bad that numerous self-described liberals actually *deny there is even a genocide*. Which is utterly insane. We know how much shit we would give Republican Holocaust deniers, right? (Or at least I would hope we all would)

Dems had an opportunity to solidify / get back the working class in 2016 but worked hard against it, thinking giving platitudes were enough, and counting on support for otherwise disenfranchised groups.

Sadly, while I'm willing to live with lower financial means if it means ensuring lgbt folk, racial minorities etc can get basic human rights, this is not true of the electorate at large. Hell, even many staunch democrats were willing to continue funding genocide if it meant getting a specific policy they personally benefited from.

Yes, I realize the economy may technically be numerically better as a whole, but most of this only served to benefit the Bezoses of the world. So many people are actually struggling even more to pay higher prices on basic needs like rent and food. And Dems touting NASDAQ to these voters, like they can't see their own struggles, only serves to push these people away from us even more

Yes, we can't do much right now to stop racists and fascists from being racist and fascist. But holding the liberal party to actually push liberal values not only benefits the party in elections, but will improve the livelihood of all vulnerable people, be they financially disadvantaged, or from a group that is discriminated against. And yeah, you and I may knoe Republican policy isn't seeking to help the poor, but when you're telling people they're better off when they aren't, you're not doing yourselves any favors, and they'll seek whatever platitudes or hope for change that they can.

I know many will accuse me of being a crazy leftie for making a simple observation, but I'm not asking anyone to start voting for communists or anything. Just try to be better aware of your local politicians, who they are beholden to, and get more involved in Dem primaries, including finding out what right-wing groups are actually *allowed* to meddle in said primaries.

It's like blaming fat people for the obesity epidemic. ""It's your fault you're fat!"" May be true on an individual level, but if you're talking about large portions of the population then clearly the environment has changed, and unless you factor *that* into your strategy, nothing will get better.

The campaign alienated progressives, alienated immigrants, alienated protesters and students, and then put on the surprise pikachu face when they lost due to shockingly low turnout.

All she had to do was say, ""Legal weed, free healthcare, lower internet and phone bills"" and she would have run away with it.

"And voters will never take responsibility for the decision they made at the ballot box, or made by not participating because not participating is also an explicitly made decision. 

After this whole thing settles, there can only be one responsible party: the Democrats.

We will just ignore the fact that incumbents have been losing elections globally at unprecedented rates this year, that Harris' margin of loss in raw counts is smaller than most elections this year is smaller than most. The electorate will never take responsibility for their failure to make the sound choice in a moment of critical civic responsibility. 

And when 2026 comes round and if we have another national election, the same song and dance: what can my politician do for me, and if they're not literally everything I want, I will spite them by not supporting them no matter what they say, because tolerating compromise is unpalatable, even when the opposition supports the most heinous embodiment of all human vice. 

We can only blame the Democrats, because it conveniently allows the electorate to not do any self reflection on just how fractured, broken, self-serving, ill educated, gullible it is. ""But I didn't know!"" and ""I thought this wouldn't happen even though he said it will"" will be a reoccurring theme the next four years, and come 2028, mark my words, the electorate will have learned NOTHING at all.

If this incenses you incidental reader, those who made the unsound choice are your neighbors and peers. People who opted out despite your  bodily autonomy was at stake at the ballot box, and I am not merely referring to ballot measures for abortion rights. People who opted out, rejected a first time home buyer credit, rejected a higher national minimum wage, rejected child tax credits, rejected a housing construction boon.

They only care about who is perceived to be better for the economy. A prez cheated on his wife, lied about it and has connections to Epstein. Trump? No, Bill Clinton. Yet democrats are perfectly fine with him. In fact, they voted him in a 2nd time. Starting to sound familiar?

Trump tied Harris to Biden, and Biden was historically unpopular. Whether you like it or not the dem party  is viewed by voters as the party of Elites and celebrities. They're viewed as a close minded party with a moral superiority over regular voters who don't have every waking moment to study policy because they're too busy getting fucked by a system, and all they want is some sort of change.

You can argue for days on end that voters are dumb, voters are stupid, voters need to research more, and YES, you are absolutely right. But at the end of the day, this is the game we are playing, and these are the people we need to win over. If you don't, you end up with outcomes like last Tuesday.

Everything else is either a straight Trump or Democrat voter.

At this point I am kind of over Bernie.  He is just a liberal populist who is with the Democrats when they do something he likes and then shits on them when they lose. 

Then he wins reelection in one of the whitest and most liberal states, without really needing to sacrifice anything.  He also never gets substantive policy passed, but only rails against both parties.

And finally, Kamala, by her voting record was most aligned with Bernie, more than any senator.  So who exactly is he fighting here?  Democrats ran the Senator / Vice President who votes almost identical to him.

We've had so many chances to advance policy since 2008 but we readily scoff at the idea that anything we have achieved was worthwhile.

Obamacare plus a public option was nationalizing healthcare. Even Bernia lost the plot with that one. A public option would have been the cheapest healthcare. If it became the default because of that it would have killed the industry opposing nationalization.

Kamala Harris has a very strong impression of being an institutionalist. Someone who would fight for institutions, not tear them down. Of course Kamala was talking about the type of institutions that literally hold our nation together and get rid of criminals. But that nuance was lost. And to be their credit, Kamala is very institutional.

When Kamala was younger, she protested against the death penalty. As CA AG, she fought for it, despite being widely unpopular in CA.

It can't get anymore institutional than that.

Kamala had very little time to campaign. She only had 3 months vs Trump's 4 years. Every second counted. And she spent a whole effing day of that entertaining the VISA CEO at her house, amidst the DOJ bringing an anti-trust lawsuit against them for gouging small businesses with fees.

On domestic issues, I was a fan of Kamala. But even I knew that she was going to work within existing systems, rather than do something bold like what Obama did with healthcare.

And to be honest, Biden did some institutional rawamping himself. Lina Khan. em effing Lina Khan!

If I was in a coma and learned about Biden's accomplishments but told me it was Bernie who won and did them, I would have believed you.

Even though Biden won, he was smart enough to realize it's because of Obama being the de-facto leader of the democratic party and Biden only won due to Obama's involvement. Biden knew that the people really wanted Bernie, and so he did everything he could to implement his domestic agenda.

But he marketed himself in a way not to spook conservative voters, instead of marketing himself to those desperate for change.

But a non-college educated white guy isn't even going to realize this. All they saw was Biden supporting institutions.

Also, i have say that Gaza probably painted the impressions on what Biden and Kamala would do on domestic policy. Though Gaza was not a high priority on the vast majority voters concerns, I can imagine that if Kamala and Joe can't stand up to a ginocide, how are they going to standup for others with no voices? It may explain why 30 polls found that Kamala would have gained 5-6 points in all of the swing states, despite Gaza being a low priority for voters.

In 2028, it'll be Ron DeSantis, who would probably also be seen as an institutionalist as 2x gov of Florida. But so would Gavin Newsome, and for the midwest, Gavin would probably be seen more of the institutionalist.

AOC has very similar messaging to Bernie Sanders. I think she would do well in 2028.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

It didn't, and we won't.  People wanted change, and Trump offered it to them.  Change for the worse absolutely but change nonetheless.  Middle and working classes have been getting screwed for decades and it all came to a head with Trump.  Bernie Sanders is absolutely correct in everything he says.  Democrats had every chance to offer a populist alternative on their own and they blew it.  Fiddling around with the margins like Dems are wont to do just isn't going to cut it these days.

Incredibly sad to see women's rights set back 2 generations, and all the bigotry that has exploded into the mainstream with the 'Trump Train' but at this point who the hell can be surprised at that.  It's been going on years now.

Also, grocery prices have been hitting people incredibly hard, and at the end of the day, being able to afford to eat beats every other consideration.

Time for Dems to step out of their ivory towers, fire the consulting class who have been advising them, and clean house.  Of course, like Bernie said, don't bet on that happening.

With a 6-3 right wing court, we saw Roe get overturned with women losing rights over their own bodies, Chevron get overturned which makes the executive branch toothless in overseeing regulations, and we saw presidents get immunity- another blow to democracy.

"There’s a lot that could have been done differently. First, she should have separated herself from Biden. His approval rating is under 40%, she tied herself to an anchor. That also doubled down on the fact that she is the “establishment candidate” whereas it gave room for people to think of trump as a change candidate.  Also, it’s very clear that Biden’s administration was far more concerned with preserving Joe’s legacy and ego rather than actually supporting Harris’s campaign. 

Second, the biggest concern yet again for voters was the economy. She kept saying that she would continue with Biden’s plan and everything was great. And while many of the traditional metrics to measure that are true it doesn’t translate to normal people. Most people don’t own stocks. The majority of Americans are living to paycheck to paycheck. There’s a cost of living crisis, particularly with housing and groceries. Her plans about the economy were small and technocratic. Dems continue to refuse to have large systemic fixes or programs to what increasingly is an economy that hurts the working class. 

Third, she called trump a fascist while also normalizing republicans. She was campaigning with Liz Cheney who had previously said democrats were aborting babies after birth. Walz had a friendly conversation with Vance instead of an adversarial debate. Democrats basically just admitted that republicans were right about their main issue, immigration, by saying over and over they supported Lankford’s border bill. That one is doubly bad because she’s already getting attacked for being the “border czar” and then dems say republicans are right

Fourth, their messaging was terrible. They started out pretty good by calling republicans “weird” and Walz making a couch joke about Vance but that all quickly stopped because several DNC consultants thought it was “too mean”. Which led to basically muzzling Walz and Kamala using much less confrontational language. Instead she talked about prosecuting transnational gangs and the opportunity economy. There’s also some people who for Trump because Biden overturned Roe v Wade. Yes, that’s dumb, but if people don’t know the reality then that’s a problem of messaging, but that part was also the responsibility of Biden’s campaign too. 

Fifth, many of the campaign surrogates were chosen terribly. There’s a cost of living crisis and you send Mark Cuban to campaign for you? Someone who also speaks out against one of the most successful parts of Biden’s admin, Lina Khan? Someone who said he would make sure Harris didn’t tax rich people on unrealized gains? Or Michigan isn’t looking good and you send Bill Clinton? The one who signed the NAFTA bill which gutted the rust belt? Where there’s a real problem with Muslim American support over Gaza and he tells them to basically shut up about it?

There’s a lot more but it speaks more to systemic problems of the DNC and not this specific campaign. And, once again, Harris was severely hampered by Biden dropping out only 3 months before the election. It’s clear from the polls that she did better than Biden would have but there were still plenty of voters that apparently weren’t aware that Biden had even dropped out.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"She certainly didn't platform on those goals. She never mentioned them in any interview I saw, instead all I saw was her cozying up to Cheney and the Bush's. Actions speak louder than empty words and she has no actions to support what you're saying.

"> Nah, not the voters' fault. It's 100% on the Dem party

If your take away from my comment is that only the voter can be blamed, you are highly mistaken. The Democrats as a congregation definitely has their own share in this matter.

As long as we continue this asinine belief that the only responsibility voters have in this electioneering process is to be courted to the ballot box, this will absolutely not change. This was true in 2016, when voters chose to not participate because their choice was between Clinton and the embodiment of all human vice. This was true in 2020, when voters chose to participate because they saw what this embodiment of all human vice did. This was true in 2008, when voters voted for Obama, a black man, and wanted change.

We can absolutely criticize the Democrats for failing to show up, but absolving the voter of any responsibility in an electoral process which requires both voters and candidates to participate is merely avoiding the uncomfortable truth that the electorate at large is ill-educated, gullible, easily influenced, complacent, ignorant, or simply unwilling to commit to their civic responsibility. 

And if the electorate doesn't change, nothing is going to change. And it won't, because of attitudes like this.

Democrats voters must fall in love to vote. The reason this is true because anything less than pure adoration will cause them to not show up. Even when the choice is between a qualified woman and the most heinous embodiment of human vice.

The problem with this analogy is you can't please everyone. You can't make everyone love you. Maybe you might be successful if you tried. And because voters can't fall in love, they don't show up. _Because anything less than falling in love is simply not enough_.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"Both are actually not mutually exclusive. Hell yes the DNC needs to do better, but voters voted for Trump and others decided to sit out or vote 3rd party.

Approval (preferably) or ranked choice voting (also pretty good), as opposed to single vote first-past-the-post voting, would make parties other than the Democrats and Republicans viable. Proportional representation would ensure all viewpoints are represented in proportion to how prevalent they are in the populace (so conservatives in California and liberals in Texas would matter), and campaign finance reform would limit the ability of foreign and domestic monied interests to buy a bigger megaphone for their preferred candidates.


The result, ideally, would be that each legislative body would be made up of representatives from many smaller parties, instead of two huge ones. Since no one party would be capable, most likely, of reaching the necessary majority to pass legislation on their own, they would have to form interparty coalitions on an issue by issue basis, to pass legislation. This would hopefully result in more, smaller pieces of legislation being passed instead of the sweeping mega bills we've all gotten used to, and would limit the value in periodically deciding to tactically obstruct the passage of popular legislation to make your only viable opponent look bad.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

The issue is that good policy doesn’t fit nicely into neat little sound bites quite like “Build the wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it (somehow)!” or “Drill, baby, drill!”.  Democratic policies are more complicated, nuanced, and often take years for the benefits to be realized, often requiring short term sacrifices.  If American workers truly, honestly cared about policy, the republican party would be dead.  The fact of the matter is Americans fundamentally do not care about policy if the economy is struggling (regardless as to why the economy is struggling) and there are culture war non-issues which truly do not effect their lives at all but nevertheless motivate them to vote.

"> Dems tried to go right, and best as I keep seeing we didn’t gain any and we lost some of our own.

Dems didn't really ""go right"". What they did was severely downplay/ignore economic issues and try to make the election about abortion rights and fascism.

The goal was to get all the white MAGA women to jump ship and start voting for democrats. Kamala spent a *lot* of time parading around with Liz Cheney trying to get republican women on board. Democrats were salivating at the thought of registered republican women secretly canceling their husband's vote in masse.

It backfired spectacularly. Kamala lost the working class vote, and still didn't pick up any republican women to show for it.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"> Dems tried to go right, and best as I keep seeing we didn’t gain any and we lost some of our own

I think we need to dispense with the idea the Democrats are going right-wing. It's true that the Democrats sought to court Republican voters, and as Harris said herself, she sought to be a president for everyone, regardless of whether they agreed with her or not. This entails representing Republicans and speaking to them and trying to include them, and I absolutely understand that's not what some voters want.

On the same hand, Harris campaigned on a ton of progressive policies. The pro-union work aside, her campaign focused on abortion rights and the criticality of reproductive health access -- we see this reflected in ballot measures all across the nation but don't see the same support for her at the top of the ballot.

This is very important to realize: every individual voter's caricature of their ideal candidate is not always going to be the same caricature the next voter will vote for. At some point in this process, we are ultimately going to be talking about votes and numbers -- what should I say to gain a net total of votes where I need them most? And if this sounds absolutely callous and terrible to you, it's because it is. But this is how elections are won. 

But to the broader point of reframing how Democrats run their campaigns, that is absolutely true. Some voters cannot be trusted to do their civic duty, therefore the process after is to court the voters that will, and the voters that might with a bit more urging.

I don't really want to go into what I think the Democrats should have done, or should be doing next. I just really wanted to point out that electioneering is multi-group participatory effort and solely pinning the outcome on one group at the expense of everything else is just a convenient excuse.

If there is a bottom line, it is this: voters need to participate and to use their vote as a tool. And voters need to be willing to share part of the burden of every election.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Meaning that voters aren't voting on policy, they are voting on emotion and the lies of a demagogue.

"If those 15 million people claim they needed to be “convinced” to vote in what was very clearly an easy choice in the most important election to-date, then they were never reliable or even likely votes in the first place and by all means deserve to have their feelings hurt and egos checked; like holy fuck, you don’t respond to MAGA “snowflake” accusations by actually snowflaking. You can’t talk down on MAGA’s intelligence (like the entirety of Don’t Look Up) and then follow up with your own version of fickle stupidity via inaction.

">It's about whether there are proposed changes that sound like they will help to someone who has no data and no time or ability to do any further investigation.

The problem is, regardless of whether these people have time to do any further investigation, Democrats are only willing to propose realistic, achievable policy goals, which will never be as desirable as whatever's promised by someone that only says what sounds good, regardless of whether it's feasible, effective, or conflicts with other promises. If you're not in favor of encouraging both sides to lie and make empty promises, you have to hold voters responsible for staying minimally informed. You cannot have a functioning democracy with an uneducated, gullible populace that abandons their civic duty to research their options and practice reasonable skepticism towards the words of their politicians.

There's a reason the GOP attacks education, encourages religious thinking, promotes ""alternative facts,"" cries fake news, etc. The plan, which appears to have succeeded, has always been to destroy people's ability to discern fact from fiction, to exhaust their attention so that they no longer have the energy to stay informed, and to work them to death so they can't be bothered to care about a world beyond that to governed by their next meager paycheck.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Agreed. As I’m being this up more now I’m trying to be more careful about my language and saying courting the right. Because that is what they were trying and in the manner you described. 

It’s something their gonna have to face facts on eventually, and it probably won’t be next election (if there is one) unfortunately, if just because they’ll be able to run on what most can safely assume will be a failing economy if republicans keep and maintain their current agenda",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Just laying the blame solely on voters (or Trump, or how could republicans vote for him) as I see it is going to cause problems later. It’s fine to blame all those things too in my opinion, but we still lost. The campaign people and party representatives have their share too.

So as it looks until we get more data, it seems that if you run with some republican stances, republicans will still vote Republican because why would they just pick the real thing. And even if the leftist of our party seem entitled, the ones that voted 3rd or sat out in protest make up enough to cause us to sink or swim (so they were somewhat right that we needed their vote, I just hope democrats understand that). So we’re going have to figure out something to do with them as well",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"> Just laying the blame solely on voters (or Trump, or how could republicans vote for him) as I see it is going to cause problems later.

I want to be clear I don't believe voters are solely responsible. But I do believe voters need to be willing to share some of that blame, because unless we as an electorate are capable of self-reflecting on what motivates us to vote and what compromises we must make to participate in a mandatory civic component of our lives, this will not get better.

I can go on and on and on, and I do believe the Democrats could have done better, in whatever I imagine ""better"" to be, but I refuse to be so naive as to believe that voters don't have a share of the blame, because I refuse to see voters as a passive bloc of people whose only role is to be courted to fall in love like a mating dance.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Personally I think it was inevitable. Unless Biden was tweeting at the pace that Trump did, I don’t think his accomplishments could have broke through the nearly 4 years of disinformation and opinions of the middle class hurt by world wide inflation. People wanted someone to blame.

Harris seemed stuck in the middle of not wanting to attach herself to the Biden administration and trying to lean on accomplishments of the administration that I would argue doesn’t move the needle for most Americans. $35 dollars for insulin is truly remarkable. As far as electing someone president? It’s a weak argument. 15 million new jobs in the last 4 years? That’s exciting. 

I thought her campaign was good but in the week or so leading up to Election Day, all I was hearing was that it was a flawless campaign.

"The most important issue is the cost of housing.   Harris’ plan of tax credit was inflationary, goal of 3 million homes literally pulled out of the campaigns ass. Trumps (lowering cost of building through regulatory relief) is sensible and realistic.       

I understand why Dems are dismissive of the propaganda but literally he had a better, more realistic plan on the number one thing that mattered to people.  Even in progressive dem states this is where it’s headed.       

 There’s a certain degree of delusion Democrats have where they just assume their policies are better. I understand where that comes from especially regarding Trump but it’s literally a fallacious assumption.  Biden administration didn’t address inflation.  Progressive caucus pushed for policies that even under a pared down bill added 50% to inflation. Remember when Manchin was warning them about inflation?  Remember how the administration initially reacted, they dismissed and minimized, and were super wrong.  Those things have consequences.

Treating him like the “threat to democracy” is a pretty stupid idea actually.  We did not learn.  The bullshit  and our reaction to it makes him look strong and drives us off message.  And we already weren’t super focused on the correct things.  CHIPS Act is fine, you have to do the smart things that set us up for the future, but literally nobody gives a fuck when they can’t afford rent.      

And you do actually have to counter the bullshit.  Trump is saying he’s going to pressure the fed to lower interest rates. He’s actually talking about it, and it puts Dems in the position of having to defend a kind of abstract idea of independent central banks which is just the kind of thing that gets voters going.  Democratic norms in banking, mmmm that’ll get the working class going.  market based solutions oooh baby baby.  There are so many ways Biden just wasn’t the dude to meet the moment.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Deregulation is not sensible or realistic. Look at Florida and hurricanes. Lack of regulations is why they don’t have houses that can battle or defend against the weather. Or those coastal town where houses are falling into the ocean because of lack of regulations. It’s being cheap and greedy, not valuing the interest of safety or well-being of your constituents.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"""regulations"" is a nice sounding scapegoat for housing prices, but regulations are what protect our houses from fires, build strong codes to withstand hurricanes, etc. We need to continue building long lasting, safe homes. Regulations for things like wire gauge, smoke detectors, etc are probably not the holdup on building more.

Housing prices went sky high because rates were down so long. Most people look less at the total price and more at the monthly payment. If they can afford a $350k home at 7% interest, then interest rates drop to 3% and they can suddenly afford more, sellers raise their price. And people pay it, because they can afford it. It's the same monthly price after all. But then when the rate goes back to 7%, those prices look silly. The monthly payment coupled with the now-normal high price is unaffordable. That's where we are now.

Greenlighting rushed, unsafe homes will only lead to problems in a few years. I may be being generous to Harris here, but I kind of assumed they had a plan for building new homes in certain areas that could use it most, and giving those holes more favorable rates or something.

You're right, more details would have been nice. I think Harris also did start just adding things to her promise list indescriminantly at the end there. Regulations on grocery price gouging? I would have loved a bit more thorough explanation on that plan. My first reaction is that sounds like government overreach. Maybe they had identified specific profiteering somewhere that was monopolistic price fixing or something, but... Yeah I want more details before I'm on board with government pricing controls for regular items.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"The Republican Party of modern-day has it’s roots as the ‘Southern Democrats’ (the Dixiecrats), the political party that arose from the Confederacy, in opposition to Abraham Lincoln & his new party, the Republican Party that began as a party to resist Slavery as the root of many of the USA’s “problems” of that era.  The Democratic Party adapted policies in support of Civil Rights in opposition to the Jim Crow laws enacted in Southern States that mandated separation of white & black people, red-line laws, separation in education (Brown vs Board of Education), lynchings, etc.  when President LBJ (a Democrat) signed the Civil Rights Act in 1964, essentially ALL of the Southern Democrats, the Dixiecrats, abandoned the Democratic Party & joined the Republican Party in protest & opposition to Civil Rights, Equal Rights, etc.  As happens with people, they move for jobs, & many other reasons, so we have a lot of Southerners (not all Southern US citizens are racist, but by history, most of them have been - hates teaches hate & needs hate & fear to continue to grow) moved out of the South & to other parts of the US.  This is where you find a lot of the racist policies & racist ‘dog-whistles’ you hear coming from Trump - these are his people.  The KKK has morphed into White Militia groups, like ‘The 3 Percenters’ & ‘The Proud Boy’s’, and many more, who were solidly represented at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.  Charles Koch & his Bros, born & raised in Kansas, family of oil-barons, still one of the richest people in the USA, joined the Libertarian Party (founded in 1971), whose platform emphasizes individual liberty (“freedom”) in personal & economic affairs (stress “economic”), avoidance of “foreign entanglements” (isolationism & “America First”), free trade & migration (Wikipedia definition).  As the Libertarianism Party couldn’t really get enough voters to get behind it’s platform, they kinda bought-up the Republican Party who rolled right over for all the financial backing & money that Charles Koch & many other ultra-rich billionaires gave them (this is the impetus behind ‘Citizens United’ decision of the SCOTUS), at about the time that Ronald Reagan, a charismatic actor who was active in California politics, & who they supported.  After >50 yrs of billions & billions of dollars poured into the GOP (Grand Ole Party - what it was back-in-the-days of the Civil War, now the Republican Party), through many tax-free organizational & research groups, like The Heritage Foundatiin’, the GOP adopted many of the ideas of the Libertarian Party - this is where the marriage of “fiscal conservatism” (the idea that people shouldn’t have to pay taxes, at least the rich corporate & business class) & racial bigotry, hatred & resentment occurs.  They’re all still very much of the Republican Party believer’s belief system (now, to be fair, not all Republicans are selfish & racist, but, to be fair also, many are, & you can hear the subtle gas-lighting & dog-whistles in the speeches of Trump, etc.).  Then, and still, in the 1960’s - 1980’s, Republicans still had a hard time getting voters to join their party in a solid-enough way as to ensure winning National elections.  The pendulum of history had swung to the Left in politics - the Civil Rights mvmt, the Kennedy’s ‘War on Poverty’, the backlash of young people against conservative beliefs (this was when the SCOTUS struck down state laws banning marriage between people of different races, when SCOTUS decided that states couldn’t prevent the use of birth control by people, that women couldn’t be discriminated against, prior, they couldn’t take out loans, own a credit card or have their own private checking account in most states prior to 1974, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), & Roe v Wade, decided in 1973, that women all across the USA had equal rights to Abortion & Reproductive Care.  This is what “MAGA” means, the Koch Bros, Heritage Foundation, etc, have been pushing since they joined the Republican Party to have many, if not all of these “Freedoms” & “Rights” repealed).  In the 1970’s the GOP courted & incorporated the ‘Moral Majority’ political mvt, a ‘Born Again’ Christian mvt, mostly of white followers, into the folds of the Republican Party.  Many White Christian churches (some Evangelical, some Catholic, Pentecostal, the Christian Liberty Party, etc), have congregations that believe in ‘Christian Dominianism’, a belief that God gave them the theological mandate to rule the USA - this is where you see them pray over Trump, & he says things like “I will protect you” & “I am your salvation”, because most of them believe that he was sent by God to help them enact their beliefs on the American Public, the 1st big one was the Dobbs Decision by the SCOTUS & his appointment of 3 additions SCOTUS Justices on the Supreme Court.

"I think it’s all a little overhyped. Not only overhyped but to the point of scaremongering.   

For example, on day one, he will start the most extensive deportation campaign in history. That is not going to happen. If Americans think they have been experiencing high inflation rates, see what kind of cost/wage push inflation happens if you deport millions of people.  Starting a tariff war will again only hurt the US economy.  If any of Trump’s outrageous promises come true, the US economy will be in dire straits. 

Americans need to learn, quickly they aren't the hegemony they once were, with a rising China, emboldened Russia, India the most populous country on earth flexing its military and economic power. 

Brexit is what it was predicted to be - an economic mistake of epic proportions, brought in again by another populist who fooled a majority into believing his ideas where better than all the worlds economic thought.  Hubris on an unseen level in western politics.  

It would be onto easy to imagine, at this point, the world to turn its back on American leadership and the economic power that this leadership brought. 

Everyone panicked when Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were elected. The world survived. Trump likely doesn’t understand any real economic thought. I think there is much doubt that he’s ever read a book on classical economics and the effects of neoliberalism as an intellectual idea or Political philosophy.  

The US’s democracy is much stronger than Donald Trump and will survive him just fine. Not only will it survive him, but there is a good chance that if the Democratic Party continues its healthy path towards more centrist ideology instead of trying to curry the populist driven far left, they will be a safe harbour in an economic maelstrom.

In my country, Canada, and the US, the less educated, economically illiterate, right-wing Christian vote was won through baby boomers and the edge lord bro types of Joe “dumb as fuck” Rogan by fooling them into believing that inflation could have been avoided after Covid 19. This group forgets that interest rates were .5% right before Covid.  During economic downturns, dropping interest rates allows the Central Bank to reduce risk to lubricate the economy,  when it’s already at .5%—any further drops in interest rates risk stagflation, where Japan has been stuck for decades.  

The righteous right will never learn economics or try to understand partisan politics.  Men like Donald Trump and our Pierre Poliverie (Maple MAGA), will cause stunning damage to our economies if they attempt to “keep promises” to the unhinged, ill-informed, meme driven Right who elected them.

Moreover if the conservative right wanted to continue this arc of neoliberalism then I don’t think that Donald Trump and Pierre Poilievre will be the standard bearers they hope will usher in a new era of conservative thought. 

If anything, these two men will damage the conservative right mortally for years to come. They have backed themselves into a corner where there is no escape.  

If they keep their promises, then “it’s the economy stupid” will not be their crowning achievement - there will be economic chaos.

If they don’t keep any of their promises, then their populist rhetoric will lose what little credibility it had with the hordes of Dunning Kruger soldiers who elected them.  

Suppose the Liberal Party of Canada and the Democratic Party resist going further from the centre and find a closer center orbit. In that case, neoliberalism will need more evolutionary, not revolutionary, thought before becoming a credible alternative in today’s increasingly corporate-dominated world.

I think Donald Trump’s election might be one of the most potent antagonists to the Liberal cause in decades. This antagonism it seems will only advance centrist Liberal thought, the power of regulated capitalist economies, and the splendid idea of social democracies. 

Just my two cents.  A hopeful prediction. It will take years to fix the damage but both our countries will survive.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

These companies would likely put pressure on the Republicans in the Senate to reject any confirmation. His proposals to the FDA would also harm our ability to approve drugs or treatments. Many countries don't have their own drug approval agency and rely on the FDA instead. It's likely they'll also push to prevent his nomination. 

Everything else major, we can hopefully either block in the Senate, slow down until we can regain one or both chambers, or block in court.

I love Reddit but as a Christian right wing conservative, it makes me so upset to read any political thread. But of course I do it anyway because it’s hard to resist.  

I’m a business owner and I have committed to hiring non college educated individuals and bring them into a skilled industry with no experience. I have decided that for two reasons. First and foremost is to provide  an opportunity to those who don’t feel they have another good opportunity. And to be perfectly honest the other reason is because I feel it’s a good business decision to go that route. 

When we interview someone they’re usually a referral from a current employee. When people find out that we truly take care of our employees, that we’re there for them through whatever comes their way in work or out, they get so excited. I can just hear it in their voice. Feeling they’re so close to having a job where they’re valued, given an opportunity and cared for. 

But I can help but wonder. If we hire someone (and we may have already) who is like a lot of people in these threads, if they found out I’m a Christian right wing conservative, would they quit? Because I feel if they knew in advance they could possibly turn and run. But I wouldn’t see someone quitting but maybe I’m biased. I’ve always felt that could be something that helps us come together and actually listen to each other. Maybe I’m crazy",2024_11_09,05_18_26

This was it. This was our last shot. What will people do when the R’s just start canceling and interfering with elections? Protest?

Winning does nothing now.  It only prolongs the suffering.  Our institutions were dealt a mortal blow during Trump's first term, they will not survive his second.  The best you can hope for in 2028 is 4 years to stem the bleeding while getting all the blame for GOP failures before the right returns in force to finish the job.

"Honestly - and unfortunately, as much as it does seem impossible...living in one of the 240 counties that did shift to the left, it kinda makes sense.


Everything in my red town made me think it'd be a landslide. There were few Trump signs. There were few Trump memes on the local page. Hell, even fewer attacks on drag shows than typical.


The day of the election our Republican strongholds in the county went HARD. Voter turnout was big, but not enough to shift it right in our county. And my poll worker friends saw it. Lots of first time voters - younger men.


I think our town shifted left because we were actively calling out the shit this summer and making statewide news. But if you look at the villainization of drag, or CRT, or whatever boogey monster they want to tout - it just didn't exist this June. I think Republicans got smart and shut up.


Say they had 50 million at the start of this cycle - because 20 million became never Trumpers. They made up for that number with podcast young men. I don't know what the breakdown is of those two demographics - but I suspect we will in the future.


Trump wouldn't win with the same turnout as 2020. But the turnout in 2020 was ridiculous. People were forced to see how fucked up shit was because Republicans said the quiet part out loud.


I think after months of their church telling them to keep quiet and vote Trump - now we're seeing them go HARD. It's like when a toddler beats you in the silent game, they tell you everything that they've been containing for the past 3 days in a constant word vomit.


Keep in mind: Republicans have hella third spaces throughout the country: churches, coffee shops owned by their congregation member, and animal clubs (elks, moose, eagles, etc).


Democrats don't have many - especially in red areas. And when they do things to invite the queer population, or whatever population, it becomes the biggest outrage the town has ever seen. Democrats, and liberals in these towns find a stronger community online as opposed to in person.


20-40 years ago - I think third spaces were a lot more neutral. Now they're not. They're echo chambers that aren't as easily infiltrated like Truth Social. And they are a powerful, non-political seeming force against any liberal third space.

Bullshit. They and others like them will deny they ever voted, or claim they didn't vote for ""this,"" or any other number of weak excuses that will never absolve them of the power they just handed to the most vengeful, reprehensible piece of shit on the planet. 

The most people ever deported by the U.S. in a single year was 400,000, under Obama. They plan to ""deport"" 20M+, when there are only 11M immigrants in the country in total. The cost of actually deporting this many people would dwarf even America's military budget and the logistics of it would bring the country to its knees. The only possible explanation for that ""plan,"" given these facts, is that deportation is *not* their goal -- and you're worried about First Amendment violations.

"Trump's already hard at work breaking promises. Will his allies care?

Trumpists are mental gymnasts, but they're very simple and predictable. Some will claim Trump never said he'd end the war within 24 hours of being elected. Some will say he was joking. Some will say it was hyperbole and that he's just a salesman. Honestly, most will never even hear this news or have the curiosity to look into how Trump is performing.

At the end of the day, the war rages on and Trump doesn't have a plan. Truth is dead, and nobody seems to care.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Duh, he gets in office Jan 20th.  “I would fix that within 24 hours. And, if I win, before I get into the office, I will have that war settled. A hundred percent sure,”.  He is saying two things here but basically once he is in office it will be fixed within 24h but will likely be fixed before he gets in office. Both Putin and Zelensky are already talking about peace now.  Hamas wants to end its war. Qatar is kicking Hamas out now that Trump is in. The ball is rolling. The war will be over before Jan 20th.  Promises made, Promises kept.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Yeah, more lies from left-wing media: He made two separate statements. One where he said he would solve the Ukraine issue in 24 hrs (presumably, after entering office). In the second statement, he says that if elected, he would end the war before taking office. We can guess as to whether that was more hyperbole or not, but he still has plenty of time.

The question should be how do you get people to care? How do you get people to want to know what is going on? Is personal hardship the only thing that will get through to these voters?",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"For anyone blaming this on trans people and on people who advocated for us...

Bullshit. We asked to be accepted instead of being treated like freakshow anomalies that exist on the margins of society because there's no room for us IN society. We decided it was time our existence be normalized, and that room be made for us in everyday life. That trans children (like I myself used to be) have options made available to them that I never had.

The problem is that the many people simply refuse to acknowledge that some people are just trans and that's fine. That some people are just happier when they are allowed to transition. That some teens just have better mental health outcomes if they are permitted to go through the opposite puberty than the one they'd undergo without intervention. People always accuse us of ""denying reality"" but the reality the right is constantly denying is the fact that a certain portion of our population would simply live better, healthier, more fulfilling lives if 1. We are allowed to transition, and 2. This is treated as acceptable and social norms around names and pronouns change to normalize it. Society would not be harmed by any of this. You are not harmed when you respect a trans person's name and pronouns. You are not harmed when trans people get to transition as teenagers and are happier for it. Cis women are generally not harmed by the presence of trans women in sports (this is a bit more complicated, as hormone level DO impact athletic performance, but most research suggests that a trans woman who went through a female puberty is on-par with a cis woman performance-wise, with some research suggesting they actually perform WORSE than most cis women).

"I promise you, we are all terrified. My life is about to be upended because of Trump and Kamala’s actions this year.

I want people to understand something. Even if Project 2025 does not pan out and Trump fails at branding us all as pedophiles who deserve to be executed, we re about to face an unprecedented amount of violence on the streets. We are going to suffer at the hands of every conservative that feels emboldened by Trump’s rhetoric to enact violence against us. Even the ones who won’t hurt us physically will start harassing us, turning us away from stores, and start turning us away from employment.

I refuse to be told by anyone that I am being hyperbolic. What I described was the reality for my community all the way back to the early 2000’s, and we are going to see a return to this, except probably wore this time.

Because of Trump’s victory, I’m suddenly trying to prepare to leave Florida. I know Florida will become a hotbed for trans oppression, and I will not stick around to be shot at in the middle of my blue city. I suddenly have to figure out the quickest way to sell my home and leave to somewhere that I’ll have a longer guarantee of my basic rights being protected, such as my access to healthcare.

Not only am I scared, my wife is scared. She is afraid of what will happen to our marriage, and she’s trying to navigate through the complicated feelings of knowing that there’s a chance that she too could be branded a criminal for even being romantically involved with me. Because of a Trump victory, my very foundational family structure has a chance of being uprooted as we make emergency plans to figure out where our lives are supposed to end up at.

I want to make something else very clear. I am extremely disappointed and upset with not only conservatives, but with the fucking liberals that let this campaign fall through. If you, at any moment, were on this subreddit or have expressed irl that Kamala’s campaign was doing perfectly fine, with no flaws, and that Mamala always had this in the bag, I am talking about *you*. You let the Democratic Party feel complacent with many of its flaws that I saw coming a million miles away about how no working class American was going to give half a shit about her. As far as I’m concerned, every liberal here who had their head up their own ass is the same white moderate that Martin Luther King Jr. used to write about.

And I don’t care if this part of my post is what gets me downvoted. I feel like I have every right to be upset with *everyone*, because not only is my life going to be ruined in the next 4 years, but so are the lives of every other queer person in this country, and also all the women who are about to also suffer. You have failed your mothers, your wives, girlfriends, daughters, sisters, the checkout clerk to the grocery store, the woman handing you your fucking garbage at the McDonald’s window, your school teachers, and, fuck it, even yourself if you were a woman on that koolaid. Congrats to you all. You really nailed it.

And before I end, here is my advice for any other scared queer person reading this post. Be active and do not let the fascists drag you back or keep you in the darkness. Leave your community if you must, but never be ashamed of the way you were born. Go move somewhere else where there is a community that will protect you. Get involved in your local queer groups. I wanted to be involved with volunteering for queer activism for years, but I was in college and I was on the verge of getting my degree, so I had no time. Fortunately for me, I graduated the same month Kamala lost her campaign, so now I have finally made my first appointment to go attend a session to see what my role will be in my local queer group. Create the community from the ground up if you must, and be there for each other and be kind. I would die before meeting a vulnerable queer person and letting them fall through the cracks if the next 4 years are unkind to them. We need to be there for each other, and we need to be our first line of defense, because this election has single-handedly proved to us that we cannot trust the cis heterosexual white man to ever make decisions for us that would align with our own class interests. If conservatives or liberals won’t step up to bat for us, we need to do so ourselves.

I want to believe there is hope still. We survived thousands of years of oppression. We survived the Holocaust and the setback that the Germans imposed on us when they destroyed Magnus Hirschfeld’s LGBTQ+ center. We survived the concentration camps. We survived 1950’s America. We survived Stonewall. We survived AIDS. We survived the bigotry of the early 2000’s. We survived Trump’s first term.

And we I’ll survive the next 4 years of the Trump administration. We are a scientific inevitability. No matter how hard they try to exterminate us all, more of us will always continue to be born into the world with the fire to feel good in our own bodies. Even for those of us alive right now, there are thousands of us who would rather die than let them detransition us and shove us back into the closet. I’m one of those people and I fucking refuse.

And if you want to resist, go buy a gun. We have no choice anymore if we are to survive. I hate guns as much as the next leftist, but I will pick one up if I have to learn how to defend myself and my community.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

The very first of those was actually when the nazis burned the library of the Hirschfeldt Institute of sexual science.

They turned what was arguably the global center of research into what sex, gender and sexual preference really was all about in one of the most LGBT friendly cities in the world and burned it all down.

And then they would go on to kill everyone involved they could get their hands on.

When the allies defeated the Nazis and rescued survivors from the camps, many of those who had been sent to the camps for being gay were re-imprisoned for still being gay and made to serve out their sentence or being sentenced again fir being research offenders of being gay.

It took decades before things were anywhere near the point they had been before the Nazis when it came to being able to be yourself.

Fighting back is a personal decision and not one to be taken lightly--it could cost you your freedom or even your life over the next four years.  I suggest that the trans community support each other the best we/they can.  Lean on your friends, find ways around the stupid laws that are in place or are coming.  Use the organizing that is in place--use the resources provided through GLAAD and others.  Watch out for your other trans friends--check in often to make sure they are OK.  Most of all, take care of yourself and your mental health.  For us it meant stopping reading the news or watching it on social media/television.

"Trans person here. I've heard folks say this and have been very curious about how you all think this would play out. Let's imagine a scenario for just a sec.

So, let's say US actually becomes a despotic a hellscape and government agents come knocking at a trans person's door to arrest them because being trans (or presenting as a sec at odds with one's birth sex, or using gender-affirming hormones) is now illegal. The armed trans person is supposed to — what exactly? Try to shoot down a bunch of cops and then flee? 

OK. Let's say they're an absolutely exceptional shot and not at all hesitant about shooting a bunch of law enforcement officers dead, and they kill or disable everyone who shows up at the door. 

Where exactly are they going to go now? Remember, there's a warrant out for their arrest. Law enforcement officers will know what car they drive and can track that through license plate readers and red-light/security cameras. Their cell phone can also be tracked if they take it. 

So they can either walk out with whatever they have on their back (and no phone), or contact someone to pick them up. But calling a friend from their phone will tip the cops off to the friends' involvement, so that's not a great option either.

Let's say they somehow get all this figured out. Maybe they have a friend who lives in walking distance, so they run to the friend's home, leaving their phone behind, and then the friend is able to smuggle them out of the immediate area. 

The trans person still has ID tying them to the identity of someone who is a fugitive wanted for killing law enforcement officers. How are they going to support themselves? Sure can't get a normal job. Can't leave the country, either, because their passport would be flagged. Unless they're independently wealthy or able to illegally assume someone else's identity, they're still out of luck.

And you think trans people shooting themselves out of government persecution is realistic?

I think there's a place for firearms training for trans people — specifically, trans people who are visibly identifiable as trans and could become the target of random street violence for that reason, and want a way to protect themselves from assault/battery by bigots in public. 

But it's wildly unrealistic to expect that if the government somehow tries to round up trans people en masse (also very unrealistic), that armed trans people would be able to shoot their way out. Let's stop with the Rambo fantasies.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Trans people have a *lot* to lose in a Trump presidency, even if the camps aren't likely at this stage. The most obvious change will be the revocation for any federal funding for hormone therapy, top and bottom surgeries for people who previously qualified, and political pressure put on insurance companies to not cover HRT. The government put likely try to make hormones more of a controlled substance, banning the mailing of them similar to their attack on mail-order birth control pills during the Biden administration.

Right-wing violence against the trans community is going to increase, and Trump's AG office is not going to pursue hate crime charges when it's politically incovenient. Right-wing violence from the Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer was a serious problem during the Trump era, and local police did almost nothing to stop it. Through Project 2025's takeover of the bureaucracy, the administration can put serious pressure on all the levers of justice to not charge domestic terrorists with hate crimes, downgrading the sentencing.

Additionally, when state's pass blatantly-unconstitutional anti-trans laws, the government will be on the sides of those states as the laws are reviewed through the court process, putting more strain on the resources of the ACLU.

"I would say NY is one of the better states, but before coming out to some people as genderfluid, I heard some pretty gross stuff from medical professionals at New York Health+ Hospitals/Jacobi regarding a trans patient while I was in the ICU. They were openly being transphobic. This was back in 2021. It continued in other parts of the hospital where staff would purposely misgender as punishment for a trans patient being rude or misgender because they didn’t care. 

Then they’d turn around claim they were an inclusive hospital. While at the same time watching while another patient called another openly gay patient the f slur repeatedly and only stepped in when things were starting to get more violent. They just kept letting that patient harass the gay patient over and over and also harass female patients. Only stopping it when it seemed like it was gonna get physical. It was awful. 

For context the misgendering and the slurs/harassment happened at Jacobi’s psych ward. For any LGBTQ+ person having a psychiatric breakdown in New York. If you can help it, DO NOT, for your own mental health and safety, go to that psych ward. If you end up there don’t tell them you’re LGBTQ+ if you can help it. Especially in a political climate like this I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s worse now. I live in a different blue state now and I’ll say I actually feel more welcomed by medical professionals here than I did in New York. 

But I also still feel anxious about coming out to more people given the election results. I’ve only told one of my doctors that I’m genderfluid and now I’m regretting it. Some of my friends and my brother knows, but that’s it. I was trying to embrace it more this year and figure myself out, but now I feel kinda scared to and feel like I should shove myself back into the closet. 

I’ve been slowly trying to become more confident with experimenting with how I dress and planned on trying to get a chest binder to experiment more with. It felt exciting and relieving to finally start to embrace myself after years of denying parts of myself. I felt worried before given how people like me were being painted as groomers or crazy, but I had hope that it wasn’t the majority and that most people were accepting and didn’t really care that much. That many people weren’t out to actually do any harm to me and don’t truly believe I’m trying to do harm. 

Now I just feel depressed because it seems like more people than I thought see us as the villain or are perfectly fine with our rights potentially being taken away or are okay with threats being thrown our way or just have their head in the sand on how this effects us. I should be able to feel safe in my own country. I’m human too. Not some boogeyman. This election has been exhausting and I’m tired of having to prove my existence is real and isn’t some wacky made up woke liberal propaganda to groom kids or some BS.

It's possible there would be bans on trans-affirming hormone therapy, possibly federally but especially in red states, and that trans people could then get arrested for accessing HRT illegally if they're caught. It is important to look into alternative means of access and to stockpile now if possible. 

People who have opportunities to move to blue areas or to immigrate to other countries (ie dual citizenship, a highly skilled career that allows for international work, etc.) that have good trans healthcare should be looking into those options if they're worried about continued healthcare access, and are likely already doing so.

But for those of us trans people who can pay out of pocket for meds and aren't relying on Medicare/Medicaid/ACA insurance coverage that could be affected by federal regs, we're not super likely to lose legal access. Might be hard to get the correct gender on some forms of ID, but things like drivers licenses will likely still be state by state. 

There will undoubtedly be some hurdles thrown in our path and a lot of hateful rhetoric, but those of us who are adult and able to access care out of pocket are in a comparatively good position in the trans community. We need to keep our heads on straight and not panic to be able to help and support the trans people who will really need it — minors having their care banned outright or people partway through the immigration process, for instance.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"> The current Supreme court....

... wants all decisions ultimately decided on by the Supreme Court.

The one through line in all their decisions in the last few years has been ""we get to decide."" In fights between the States and the Federal Government they come down on whichever side gives them the most input (and that varies from case to case). In fights between the executive branch and the legislative branch, they say it has to be decided on a case-by-case basis by the courts. In fights between Congress and the regular courts, they say it is for the Supreme Court to decide, not the lower courts.

They threw out the concept of judicial precedent so that every case has to go up to the Supreme Court, and they can decide whether they want to interfere.

They're not setting out tests the lower courts can use, they're not deferring to executive agencies, to Congress or to the States, they're not necessarily being consistent their own rulings. The conservative majority on the Supreme Court's judicial philosophy is ""no one gets to decide but us.""

And usually they decide in the conservative-leaning way. Under the Biden Administration they leaned more towards ""states rights"", because the states - on average - were more conservative. But there is no world in which they uphold a ""states rights"" argument from California say against a Trump Administration - unless it somehow gives them - the Supreme Court - more power.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

I said he should declare January 6 2021 as an insurrection, name Trump as having explicitly given aid and comfort to that insurrection (as well as Clarence Thomas or anyone else Jack Smith has information on), making any insurrectionists ineligible for office, and have Jack Smith dump all of the evidence they have in front of congress.  If congress wants to remove their disqualification let them do so, or if congress wants to bar him from office, this is their chance.  

And yes, my idea has absolutely no hope of actually going anywhere.  But you do have a mess on your hands here.  It would completely reasonable that the judge in New York could (and should) say that Trump cannot run for or accept any elected office as part of his sentence for having committed election interference.

Whether you think J.D. Vance has participated in or provided support for insurrectionists is another discussion, but the simple answer would seem to be no he hasn't.


Also, how we do it in canada and the UK is that the Sovereign or person acting on behalf of the sovereign can dismiss the prime minister.  Doing so if that person has the confidence of parliament would be extremely difficult since the 1690s, (remember the US didn't revolt against a tyrannical king it revolted against parliament which refused to give it representation).

"It doesn't happen automatically, but Thiel and Vance would be fairly motivated to do it, so you never know.

The most likely outcome is a constitutional crisis that doesn't actually result in a real crisis. The federal government basically just tells the state government to go fuck itself. SCOTUS likely affirms it with more vague executive immunity doctrine (which most legal scholars simply assume already exists, even though it's never been tested.) The state government gets super butthurt. Nothing else happens.

I mean, SCOTUS could construct a pretty devastating hypothetical to support its likely conclusion. ""Imagine it's 1872 and a black man from Mississippi has a real shot at winning the presidency. Oops, he's magically and coincidentally a convicted felon at the state level that has to go to prison. Oh well. Too bad. Guess we'll just have to have a POTUS stuck in prison, or Congress will ever-so-reluctantly have to impeach and remove him because he clearly can't do the job. What are you going to do? You have to respect the states' power to prosecute, convict, and imprison people!""

I think you could go all the way back to John Marshall and find judicial philosophy regarding federal supremacy that *strongly* suggests that a state government simply cannot fuck with the sitting POTUS. An individual congressman is not Congress, but POTUS *is* the executive branch, according to the Constitution. Giving a state the power to disrupt an entire branch of the federal government with its own legal processes would be considered beyond the pale.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Who can then?  Congress never declared war on the south in the civil war either.  

I agree that there's a legitimate question here of how someone could be declared as part of an insurrection, that would also be to my point that that jack smith case though that explicitly charges trump with trying to subvert the election.  

But the 14th amendment doesn't specify who declares an insurrection or how, but it did bar several (mostly minor) officials from taking office in the 1860s and 1870s.  

> Honestly the whole Trump charges felt politically motivated.

No, they weren't.  He paid someone  to keep her quiet about the election and filed false business reports to do so.  Don't delude yourself, this was a deliberate criminal scheme that he should have already been in jail for.  

>Hillary also denied her loss in 2016 an Al Gore denied in 2000

Having lived through both of those, no, that is not correct.  They tried to contest in courts, though it would seem Hillary would have had a better court case against trump knowing what we know now, it's not clear if it would even be possible to essentially sue him for taking the presidency from her illegally.

"Which a departure from Scalia's textualism

>The late Justice Antonin Scalia left his mark on the law in many ways, but perhaps his greatest legacy is that he changed the way we think about statutes. Before Scalia’s tenure on the Supreme Court, most judges and lawyers casually assumed that when a court interprets a statute, its job is to implement “legislative intent.” Courts often paid more attention to statutory purpose and legislative history than to statutory text.

>Scalia rebelled against these interpretive methods. He believed that when a court interprets a statute, the court’s job is to read the statutory text and do what it says.  Even if what it says is stupid. Even if what it says is not what anybody intended. The text of a statute, Scalia believed, is the law.

Article Five of the United States Constitution describes the procedure for altering the Constitution. Under Article Five, the process to alter the Constitution consists of proposing an amendment or amendments, and subsequent ratification.

Amendments may be proposed either by the Congress with a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate; or by a convention to propose amendments called by Congress at the request of two-thirds of the state legislatures.[1] To become part of the Constitution, an amendment must then be ratified by either—as determined by Congress—the legislatures of three-quarters of the states or by ratifying conventions conducted in three-quarters of the states, a process utilized only once thus far in American history with the 1933 ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment.[2] The vote of each state (to either ratify or reject a proposed amendment) carries equal weight, regardless of a state's population or length of time in the Union. Article Five is silent regarding deadlines for the ratification of proposed amendments, but most amendments proposed since 1917 have included a deadline for ratification. Legal scholars generally agree that the amending process of Article Five can itself be amended by the procedures laid out in Article Five, but there is some disagreement over whether Article Five is the exclusive means of amending the Constitution.

In addition to defining the procedures for altering the Constitution, Article Five also shields three clauses in Article One from ordinary amendment by attaching stipulations. Regarding two of the clauses—one concerning importation of slaves and the other apportionment of direct taxes—the prohibition on amendment was absolute but of limited duration, expiring in 1808; the third was without an expiration date but less absolute: ""no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate."" Scholars disagree as to whether this shielding clause can itself be amended by the procedures laid out in Article Five.

"Which is why people claiming Trump is going to be a totalitarian dictator with the power of Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin are being way too dramatic and creating needless distractions. There are way too many people with enough power to prevent that from happening and subjugating a nation of 350 million people in whatever time Trump has left on this planet is not going to happen.   


I'm concerned about chaos and incompetence, not Nazi Germany reborn in America. People can stress about 100 million Democrats being rounded up and murdered in concentration camps but it's needlessly dramatic and distracts from the real problems we are in for. Focus on what's actually going to happen, not highly unrealistic concerns about literally everyone who's ever disagreed with Donald Trump being rounded up and shot. ",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"It really depends on how each of them get chances to show their abilities. And who else emerges. Shapiro and Whitmer might be at a disadvantage here, though Whitmer has the advantage of having had a friendly legislature during her term and some legislative accomplishments, even if she won’t going forwards, while Shapiro has and will due to gerrymandering had to deal with the GOP Senate his entire term making it impossible to pass almost anything.

Buttigieg will also struggle in this regard, his highest held position is transportation secretary, and the Democrats have not nominated an individual who has not served as either a Governor or Senator since 1924 when they nominated John Davis whose highest held office was US Representative. This was also likely true of the GOP until Trump broke that streak in 2016, but I couldn’t be bothered to check every candidate lol.

">the main issue being that if the majority of white people didn’t vote for fascism Kamala Harris would be our next president

There are about  \~250 white americans. \~73 million people total voted for trump. So even if they were all white, the majority of white people did not vote for trump. The majority of white people just didn't vote at all. *But* if you subscribe to the notion that not casting a vote at all basically amounts to a vote for fascism, vis a vis ""when they came for the \_\_\_\_\_\_ and I did not speak out for I was not a \_\_\_\_\_,"" then your assertion does ring true. It depends on how you look at it.

But ultimately the fault lies with different kinds of people and for different reasons, not just one group shoulders all the blame. Republicans for actively voting for a piece of shit fascist. 1/4 of all previously-voting democrats for deciding not to vote this time. All the dipshits in the middle who threw up their hands and said ""I don't care,"" ""it doesn't effect me,"" ""both parties are the same, "" and more dumb shit like that.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"> And Russell Vought, a key author of Project 2025 who served as director of the Office of Management and Budget under Trump, told an undercover journalist earlier this year that he’s maintained close contact with Trump, has drafted hundreds of executive orders for Trump’s consideration and that Trump is ‘very supportive of what we do.’

Here’s additional coverage of Vought. His job over the past few years has apparently been the wonky bits of making Project 2025 shovel-ready for Day 1.

Centre for Climate Reporting - Undercover in Project 2025 ([Article](https://climate-reporting.org/undercover-in-project-2025/) | [Video](https://youtu.be/PY_chqyaRHo) 9:51)

[Russel Vought]  is the founder and president of the Center for Renewing America, a conservative think tank he described to his hosts as ‘the Death Star,’ which alongside the Heritage Foundation has been at the heart of Project 2025.

“Vought said he is overseeing the drafting of hundreds of executive orders, regulations and secretarial memos, to help make the US conservative movement’s radical goals a reality. These include plans for the ‘largest deportation in history’ – a promise also made by Trump – and a proposal to use the military against US citizens to suppress large-scale protests in response. This will, Vought said, help to end multiculturalism in the United States.”

“Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Convention’s Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaign’s trust in him and his ideas.”

“A key part of Project 2025’s plans is to give the President more powers, removing the independence of agencies like the Department of Justice and FBI. Vought has dedicated his time to helping make this a reality if Trump wins in November.

‘Eighty percent of my time is working on the plans of what’s necessary to take control of these bureaucracies,’ Vought said, ‘And we are working doggedly on that, whether it’s destroying their agency’s notion of independence — they’re independent from the President — whether it’s bringing back concepts that ruled until Nixon of impoundment — the ability to not spend money — whether that is thinking through how the deportation would work. Those are all the things that we are working on predominantly right now.’”

“Vought, who told the undercover reporters he had a deep relationship with the Trump campaign, even dismissed his former boss’s disavowal of Project 2025. He said his close relationship with Trump means that he can put these transition documents directly into his hands. ‘There are people like me that have his trust that will be able to get it to him in whatever position we’re at,’ he said. ‘The relationships will be there. The trust level will be there.’

Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Convention’s Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaign’s trust in him and his ideas.”",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"A platform isn't a signed contract and not all members of a political party share that exact platform anyway. You can be an anti-abortion democrat for instance. So is that fraud if you vote against your party on a major issue like that? If you tried to make it that way then that same politician will just say ""I don't have a stance on abortion"" and then still vote against.

It also gets wildly complex because votes aren't done black and white like that. In order to fulfill an oath you might have to break another because the bill to help one hurts another. So you could claim fraud constantly even when someone is voting along party lines.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Now that the election has come the Democrats abandoned the working class, all because they didn't pass a few policies he wanted? He got 80% of what he wanted and is claiming that the remaining 20% is why Harris lost. He complains about inflation but has no policy proposals to tackle it.

"No, individual votes like that happen all the time, often with strategic explainable purpose.  For example if there was a bill that gave Democrats what they wanted on abortion rights but it also included a provision to allow execution of migrants…it would be something any sane Dem would vote no on in order to formulate a better bill with less genocidal riders.

But that’s not what Tulsi, Sinema, or Santos did.  The very fact Santos was kicked out is enough to tell you that yes, politicians can go so far off platform they get expelled. It’s a thing. It’s been done. Not debatable. None of your rationale applied there.

Not all government positions have that avenue or recourse though, and that is what we’re discussing.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
Yea but saying “he’s immune so he can do xyz” doesn’t make sense unless it’s the ‘seal team 6 your enemy’ example.,2024_11_09,05_18_26
"The Biden admin's policies were the most progressive in nearly a century. The Democrats have also not focused on the needs of the working class. There's no dichotomy here: Kamala's platform was mostly aimed at the middle-class - a $25k tax credit for first time homebuyers does nothing for someone making $60k/year. She ran away from Medicare For All and proposed nothing to address the overwhelming power of capital.

She would have 100% been better for the working class than Trump, but she wouldn't have significantly changed their outlook. The vote for Trump was a vote to shake up the system, just like it was in 2016 - Kamala, like Hillary, offered incremental, small reform at a time when the electorate wants major changes.

The Dems need to coalesce around populism again. It worked the last time fascism was on the rise worldwide; hopefully it won't be too late in 2026 and 2028.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"Extreme Right > Milquetoast Centrist

"The election is over, you don't need to try to make Trump look good to people anymore, so you might as well just be honest about who he is and what he plans to do, because nobody can stop him now. If you're being sincere, and you genuinely believe that this is the same as 2016, then you're in for a rude awakening. 

In 2016 the Republican party was not at all united behind Trump, and instead was very much resistant to him, with Mitch McConnell the leader in the Senate and Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House. Back then there were a bunch of Republicans in Congress who voted to impeach Trump, some more than once. And Trump's own cabinet and administration was made up of dozens of people who worked behind his back to keep him in check and turn away his worst impulses, along with the civil service bureaucracy that Trump dubbed ""the deep state"". Back then Trump's own DOJ launched the Mueller probe into his collision with Russia. 

All those people are now gone or soon will be. The Republican party now has been fully remade to be 100% subservient to Trump, and everyone in his cabinet and administration will be pure loyalists to him alone. Trump is going to remove the entire administrative state of the federal government and replace it with loyalists. There will be nobody at any level of the government to stop what he wants to do this time. 

I can't tell if you genuinely believe what you're saying here or if you're just trolling people (it's probably the latter). But either way, I don't think you fully understand yet exactly what you voted for. In the end, it'll be just as bad for you as it will be for the rest of us, but I guess you can have your fun for now. In the end, we're all screwed.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

">However, the exit polls suggest Harris’ investment in courting Republicans was a major misfire. And while Democrats were busy making the case that Republicans should leave Trump, voters fled the Democratic Party instead — or stayed home. 

>On The Daily Show several weeks ago, Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz laid out the thinking behind the Harris campaign’s strategy of courting support from conservative elites. Republican voters “are trying to find permission to get off the MAGA stuff and move over,” he said. When host Jon Stewart expressed discomfort about the alliance with the Cheneys in particular, Walz said they “give permission to those folks who want to find a reason to do the right thing.” 

>Unfortunately for Democrats, not many Republicans wanted permission to cross over to Team Blue, and Democratic voters needed no such permission to bail.

>Harris’ efforts to run to the right on immigration did not persuade voters, either. A majority said he would be better able to handle immigration, while only 36 percent said Harris, according to the Fox survey. 

What's the takeaway here? Any progressives voting in the next primary should reject civility, institutionalism, and bipartisanship candidates. Progressives should be absolutely alarmed and brace for impending failure when their running horse starts saying anything positive about republicans, when they start seriously considering republican policies as good ideas, when they stop talking about big progressive policies, or when they start brandishing their republican endorsements. Common sense will tell you that Republicans will never vote democrats and this should not be a lesson that we have to learn for a third time after the Clinton and Harris failures.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

There’s a lot of weird psychology behind Trump. It could be that he’s so upfront about his sleaziness that some people think it’s based or whatever. Whereas Clinton tries to present himself as still a moral and respectable guy.

"Harris was a great candidate.  Not Bernie great, but well spoken, capable.  The democrats need to tackle right wing propaganda, illiteracy, and improve their platform and messaging.  Doesn't matter what candidate they present while those problems persist.

They should have sent out $500 stimulus checks.  That is not something that goes unnoticed. 

They should have responded to economy concerns by hammering home that Trump left the country with the 3rd largest national debt increase in US history, leaving every American with $23,500 more national debt to pay off, and that they'd made lots of progress in recovering from the damage he'd done but it takes many years to recover from such a disastrous presidency.

They should have instilled fear of tariffs, helping people understand that tariffs get passed on to American consumers and that Trump would channel those revenues to his billionaire friends.

They should have been hammering home, for years that ""Trump is lying to you and wants to steal from you again to give more tax cuts to the wealthy"" - because feeling deceived by politicians is something that resonates on the right, and without getting that message across, they are left only with what they see in the right wing propaganda.  

They should have worked to make voting day a national holiday, found ways to incentivize turnout.

So many things they failed to do, without which I don't think the specific candidate would have mattered.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"This infighting is stupid and missing the point. Harris was a good enough candidate and led an intelligent campaign given the circumstances. This election was not lost on policy--what on earth even is Trump's policy other than tariffs and hating people who are ""others""?

This election really came down to two factors: misinformation and Harris's connection to an unpopular administration (which is unpopular because of the misinformation).

There are real problems Americans are facing. Inflation and cost of living being foremost among them. Covid and Trump's policies caused the inflation that was predicted well ahead of time. The whole world faced it. Biden's policies enabled a soft landing and recovery that was better than nearly any other country's--though it is not finished yet. But people have not personally seen all the benefits yet, and the right has been leading a misinformation campaign on how bad Biden's economy is. Same story with immigration. Same story with the right demonizing the trans community. All this culture war bullshit. The right owns a factually incorrect narrative that convinced many low information voters. 

Harris could not really articulate meaningfully how her policies are different than Biden's since she is tied to the administration. I saw a million times ""If she wants to do that, why hasn't she already? She's the VP"" which ignores the fact that VP has basically no actual power, and the reality of getting anything through Congress with Republican obstruction. Harris couldn't say ""Well actually, I have no power right now and can't do anything"" because it would may her look weak. So she has to own Biden's policies whether she agrees with them or not. 

All this ""The left abandoned the working class"" shit needs to stop. Looking at you Bernie (I love you, but this is a terrible take). Harris had pages and pages of policies that benefited the low and middle class Americans. Trump has tariffs and deportations that are going to cause horrible inflation. This wasn't about policies that support everyday Americans or Harris would have won.

Because there are global problems from the recovery from COVID, incumbent leaders worldwide have been taking a beating. The right identified the anger that low information voters have, and some very real problems (cost of living) and some very not real problems (fears of immigrants and LGBT folks). They used those issues to create anger and drive a wedge. 

Voter turnout was lower because Covid tangibly affected everyone's lives more so than politics sometimes feel that they do. People were motivated to vote for something different. Now that the problems felt less immediately dire for a lot of people, voter apathy returned to normal levels. 2020 was the exception. Not 2024.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

When Trump won anyway: ""Oh, we should have had a primary.""

No.  Fuck y'all.  Let's call it what it is.  There's a shit ton of VERY low information voters out there, and, if you talk to the ""undecided"" folks (Who are basically exposing themselves as 'Drew Barrymore in 50 first dates' level uninformed), they're all talking about hte Economy (which is doing great)  The Election was a referendum on Biden.  Now, maybe not having his VP up there would have helped with that, but I think celebrating the real, actual, honest to god WINS the Democrats had would have done better.

The narrative people were getting was Donald Trump making all of these promises that literally anyone who understands how Economics, Civic Policy, or (insert topic here) works knew, and SAID were bullshit.  But the bullshit was being broadcasted.

If Harris' campaign had a failing, it was ""Vote for me, because, god, LOOK at this guy.""

And, yeah, if you're plugged in, if you've done nothing but stare at the train wreck that is Trump since 2015 for 9 years, that's a winning message.  Trump SUCKS, it was a MAJOR priority to keep him out of the whitehouse.  But there were A TON of people grumbling ""So, is this going to be every democratic campaign now?  Vote for me because the other guy is Hitler?""  (Ignoring that the guy is ACTUALLY hitler, and that it's the SAME GUY the last two times).  The message was bouncing off of a lot of those low information voters.  Instead, they're looking at the fact that prices aren't down to Pre-Covid Levels and pretending Biden personally did that.

Gas prices are about what they were Pre-Covid (just not as low as they were when Covid dropped demand through the floor), and, ""low inflation"" doesn't mean ""Deflation""  But taht' all too complicated for the average american voter.  There is so much they could have been doing to get the message out about how good of a job they were doing.

They ALSO could have done a much better job.  When people turned out like hell to send Trump packing, there was an expectation that, you know... he'd be SENT PACKING.  Instead, he got to attempt to overthrow the democratic process, and the ONLY lawsuit that had a chance in HELL of holding him accountable for that was basically just put on indefinite hold.  Because he won.  And he'll be pardoning himself first thing, and it will all go away.

Which makes it REAL hard to communicate to those low information voters that Trump is ACTUALLY the worst, and ACTUALLY a traitor.  Because the idea that the government was given 4 years to hold him accountable for crimes committed on national television but somehow DIDN'T makes the whole thing look like ""just political nonsense.""

And if you're convinced it's political nonsense... well, Trump starts looking an awful lot better.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Harris did not scheme with Biden for Biden not to drop out until after the debate. Harris, at most, saw the opportunity and prepared for it, then executed on it. This is not on her at all. She was the VP, of course she is going to be the President's chosen successor.

And then nobody challenged her because nobody wanted to be the one man or woman stopping the Democrats from rallying. This was something that was a talking point in the 2016 and 2020 DNC primary elections; Bernie needed to concede to unify, they said. Bernie drew voters to Trump by not backing Hillary immediately, they said. So Newsom, Whitmer, Pritzker, Buttigieg all fell in line, and there was nothing wrong with that either.

This really, IMO, mostly falls on Biden. I don't know when the mistake was made. Maybe it was not dropping out sooner. Maybe it was not replacing the Attorney General. Maybe it was running at all in 2020, or not running in 2016. Yes, we can blame Mitch McConnell and the other Republicans, of course.

- Multiple instances of intervening in favor of or publicly supporting labor during strikes

So the rest of us had to say, ""Huh. Maybe they were actually right.""

Or -- maybe they were lying about those polls too. I wouldn't be surprised now, in hindsight.

Or maybe it was for reasons others said, that it was because Harris started out with a positive focus on what Democrats would do, then midway switched to a negative fingerpointing about how Republicans were racists and fascist and misogynists and *ignorant idiots*.

A fun fact about PEN America.... They were at fore of fighting against censorship for a long time.  They led the way in fighting against corruption, censorship, and war.  Then COINTELPRO happened.  This operation saw the FBI destroy the liberal media, leaving behind only ""friendly media.""  This is why is why you no longer see images of war on tv.  Maybe if you saw a Russian missile strike a building at Mach 7 or a drone dropping an explosive on the head of a Russian soldier you wouldn't be so gung ho about supporting war.  Total body disruption is not a pleasant sight. 

The media censors everything you see and it works with the Democrats to do it.  Remember the Steele Dossier? That was all lies.  A congressional investigation proved it and the media covered it up (of course they did they were apart of it). 

Remember the pee tapes?  That was all lies.  People were arrested over it.  The media covered up these lies (of course they did, they were apart of it). 

Remember Biden's laptop showing pay for play? It was covered up as Russian misinformation? That was all lies.  Those 52 intelligence agents who claimed it was Russian collusion? All lied. The truth, censored.

MAGA thinks they’ll be able to easily implement a nationwide far right agenda, but they are underestimating the will of the people in liberal northern cities, the intelligence and resourcefulness of the “college-educated liberal elite,” and the complexities of urban warfare (especially in a case like this where a government would be unwilling to destroy its own domestic infrastructure via air strikes and heavy artillery).

I really like this city, but I’d say the current political system is broken. I will say I do like Pritzker and generally think the state government has been better than the city government though. ",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Considering that illinois is still solidly blue tells me that when it comes to fighting Maga at the state level, Pritzker has figured out a thing or two. He's also pretty down to earth and chill. Likes to get out to the people. Shows dignity and grace when he goes to the counties that don't want him there and has great charisma. No one I know in my lefty circles want him to go or move up the food chain because we don't think we will ever see another democratic candidate come along to replace him that has been this good for us as a whole. 

You wanna know what people are mad at him about? They're mad that he comes out to attend pride parades during Pride Month because he knows how important the pride parades are for the LGBTQ community. They are mad that he and his wife dressed up to celebrate May the Fourth with all the nerds because he is not so larger than life that he can't have some goofy fun with the nerds. They hate him because he got the reproductive Healthcare act done in 2019 which enshrined a woman's right not just to abortion, but over her body as a whole, including birth control because he actually DOES care about women's rights. And hey, while he was at it, he legalized medical and recreational cannabis because he is in touch with reality and does understand the racially biased history of the drug war in America and started pardoning low level cannabis convictions that prevented over 11,000 people from fully reintegrating back into society for a crime that he took off the books.

We will look back and realize how fucking stupid we were for sitting there and doing nothing all so we could have our told-ya-so moment and let the old guard of the DNC get away with leaving us behind after fucking us again.

Our leadership didn't just fail us. They are failing us. Kamala's speech was delusional. It's like she was speaking directly to Trump ""Hey I did this even when you didn't so you especially have to be a good boy""

Trump will throw her in a camp because she handed it over peacefully. You just made Trump look bad. Nobody makes Trump look bad.

What the fuck are we doing are any of us blind? All so what because we're scared conservatives might call us hypocrites?  Biden and Harris will fail us.

We have the keys to the military. We WILL regret handing them back. The constitution is a piece of paper that cannot protect us if the people in power don't care. Once Trump has a feel that the dictatorship is realized it will be like a flip of a switch and we will feel so fucking dumb.

The constitution was never why our democracy stood the test of time. It was because America had not yet failed to elect leaders in charge of safeguarding our society that wanted to live in a democracy themselves because they had intrinsic value for democratic principles.

Trump and the Republicans don't do what they've been suggesting, or find more resistance than they were expecting, the system holds, and they're voted out in the next election. Indeterminate damage to the economy, the structure of government, and the global environment occur before sensible governance can be regained.


The current administration takes matters into their own hands, and annul the election results for the sake of stopping the American people from fucking over literally everyone on the planet, and the US experiences a civil war of unknown proportions.

"That’s a whole mishmash of ideas that don’t really mean anything.

The “genocide” issue is not the winner you think it is, especially when looking for a populist message to tap into labor issues.

Kamala’s campaign was running *for* preserving and perpetuating the American experiment as a functional system based on rule of law rather than the mask off kleptocracy and grift machine that Trump will turn it into. Is that an easily digestible sound bite that makes you feel good? No? Tough. Be an adult and accept that feel good soundbites are junk and the guy pushing them is just looking to reach a hand into your pocket.

This election was not a “referendum on neoliberalism” because you have no proof of what *would* have gotten more folks to the polls. In fact, because Biden (who, if anything, was more neoliberal than Harris) won more votes you can’t solely point to policy issues as the reason. 

The only way Harris could have moved the Dearborn contingent would have been to do exactly what they demanded and even then there is no guarantee given *they voted for Trump*. So it seems the “genocide* crowd was more a way to depress and discourage lefties than it was about actual policy considerations *because it was unlikely to secure votes*.

"It was none of that crap. This was an acceptance of far right rhetoric above all else. The democrats pointed towards what they had accomplished in the Biden presidency and let Trump spout the craziest shit anyone running for President has ever said and the people said that’s what they want. The people looked at the hate and said yes. They looked at project 2025 and said yes. They don’t want Bernie or FDR. They want Charles Lindbergh. 

What put Trump over the top was Latino communities finally aligning themselves with Christo conservative values. When it comes down to it a lot of Latino communities are naturally conservative. They heard a man saying they would ban abortion, remove women’s rights, and turn America more Christian and got on board. They convinced themselves when they deport people, Trump was only talking about the other Latinos they don’t like. This isn’t about any of that crap you’re pointing out. 

In reality, if the Democrats want to win again they will have to drop a lot of issues progressives care about and move towards the right. It sucks but it’s true. No one gives a fuck about unions anymore. Their members proved unreliable as a voting base. I also imagine a major roll back in workers rights coming. Not enough people will ever care about the environment enough for it to be a major political issue. Abortion was on the ballot and not enough cared. The destruction of our entire democracy felt like it was on the ballot and not enough cared. Gen Z came out in force for Trump. That tells you about the future. The progressive movement as a platform is dead in America and will never come back. People said trans rights and the majority said it was an example of what was wrong with America. All of which is unfortunate but true. 

The way the democrats can win in the future will literally be fighting to get back some of small pieces of major socialist programs that will be ripped apart that people liked and relied on.

Social Security and Medicare are about to get sliced and diced. I wouldn’t be surprised if Democrats are fighting to keep the age of retirement under 75 and attempting return benefits to Medicare in the next presidential election.

Democrats also have to hope Trump does go all in on tariffs and crashes the economy into a depression. Nothing motivates a voting base like going hungry.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

If you're complicit with nazi shit, you're as bad as a nazi. Period.

Trump's own VP compared him to Hitler before even Biden or Kamala openly called Trump a fascist. And unfortunately, the legal system is a fucking mess, and it was made that way by the corrupt elite, via mostly the republican party, to serve their and their master's interests. We can get shit done, but it takes for fucking ever in most cases because there's shitboots that make everything difficult.

What would the world think if the left gave up their morals and did the same nefarious shit? The system would collapse, and ultimate evil would take over.

If we had a 3 party system, it might not be so bad, but we've got a shitty 2 party system, and if you're not towing the line for the left, for peace, for justice, then you're complicit with the nazis that have taken over the right.

And the right won't work with the left, even in most cases where the left bends over backwards to appease the right, simply because ""democrats evil"", ""socialism"", ""communism"" etc. The right has no interest in saving america, they want to fucking destroy it and install a dictatorial totalitarian regime.

"I'm sorry, but the math doesn't support your narrative. Look at the numbers. Trump got about the same number of votes in 2020. Harris got fewer votes than Biden in 2020, in almost every state. Why? Because the left stayed home.


Harris went hard to the center and it killed her. I voted for her, but it was hard at the end. She put her arm around the Cheneys and sought the endorsement of W. She said some bizarre stuff about America having the bestest most badass military. I was sick of that shit in 2004. When are the Democrats going to learn that the left does not want neocons? We don't want war hawks. We don't want the party to ""move to the middle,"" and when they do, we stay home!!!


Every time the Democrats have taken the left for granted and moved to the middle, they have lost. That strategy worked once in 1992 and never worked again. Move left. Energize the progressive vote. Progressives came out for Obama and he won twice. We came out for Biden and he won. We love Build Back Better. We love the PSLF. We love what Biden did for unions. Heck, we love Walz, and it was my pleasure to vote for him.


But when Kamala moved right in those last few weeks, when she put Liz Cheney front and center and said she'd put a Republican in her cabinet and tried to tout a border policy that was more conservative than anything W did and did not change gears on Israel, she lost the left. I understand everyone who stayed home and I was not surprised in the least.


Yes, Trump us awful and the next 4 years are going to suck. Maybe the rest of my lifetime will suck if the Democrats are right about the end of democracy. But like... Biden is president right now, and has been for 4 years, and Trump is not in jail, so how seriously are we supposed to take Democrats' fear mongering about the end of democracy?


The Republicans are a far right fascist kleptocracy and the Democrats are a center-right bunch of milquetoasts. The progressive left is out here and ready to go.

">Even before Tuesday, the judicial math for Democrats was dire. The three justices appointed by Trump in his first term were young by judicial standards: Justice Neil Gorsuch was 49 years old at the time of his confirmation, Brett Kavanaugh was 53, and Amy Coney Barrett was 48. All three of them could easily serve on the Supreme Court until the 2060s, and their replacement of older justices meant Democrats already faced a difficult path to flipping the court to the liberals within the next 10 to 15 years. That time horizon is now closer to 30 or 40 years.

"At least 25 to 30 years. 

I put a lot of faith in the younger generation to vote for what their generation espouses to believe in.  

As a Gen X’er, it’s concerning to see how disconnected many Gen Z’ers are from the political realities that will shape their future. Growing up in the digital age, they’ve been influenced by viral content and memes, but this often overshadows the deeper understanding of issues like tariffs, economics, and government institutions.

For instance, when politicians talk about 50% or 100% tariffs, many young people mistakenly see it as a discount. But in reality, tariffs raise prices for consumers, hurt working-class families, and don’t necessarily bring back jobs as promised. They also fail to understand the long-term impacts of their votes—particularly when it comes to issues like the Supreme Court, reproductive rights, LGBTQIA+ protections, the climate and government programs. 

Many in Gen Z also lack basic civics knowledge. Ask them about the three branches of government, and they might struggle to answer. Without this foundational knowledge, how can they understand the stakes of their votes?

It’s easy to vote based on who seems “relatable” or “cool,” but policies matter more than personalities. Elections have real-world consequences, and if Gen Z isn’t careful, they may find their rights and freedoms slipping away due to uninformed choices. It’s time to move beyond memes and social media culture and take a hard look at how their vote can shape the future.

IMO I think Gen Z they saw Trump get shot as some warrior victim. And the victim mentality is strong in this generation. He saw him be goofy  and that translated as relatable vs ineptness. 

And as it is trending many did not know Biden was no longer a candidate. 

What they yet get is SCOTUS and how that works. That if they rely on any lunch program, have a friend here illegally, want to marry a same sex person, become pregnant, is LGBTQIA+ they voted for the wrong party",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"We have lost a lot more.

There is no way to sugarcoat it. This result is catastrophic.

A Republican is fighting a Democrat neck to neck in MD-6 (my constituency). WTF? This is inconceivable on many levels. This is one of the most liberal areas in the country. I am suddenly feeling nauseous about this, and I cannot honestly look at many of my neighbours eye to eye.

When I look at the data, it doesn't even appear that the white population overwhelming voted for Trump. No!! It was the Hispanic men. I cannot fathom this - why would you vote to put yourself out of existence? I have heard from our community (Indians from India) that many voted for Trump, obviously because they got swayed by his macho persona. It was the immigrants and the gen-z men who decided to join forces with evil and bring us this result.

I haven't been able to sleep or think properly. I am still recovering from shock.

However, there is one thing - I have gotten more determined, and have started showing political engagement. No more keeping quiet. It is time for silent majority (like me) to start going out openly, and not be ashamed at hiding our disgust at this fascist regime. It is time to start getting politically engaged. It is time to start working at the grassroots level. We cannot let democracy die this way.

It democracy in America dies, the world will be a horrible place for humanity. America has given us so much. It is time we return the favor. America is in trouble, and we have to wage a battle. Not all battles are fought on the field. This has to be fought to regain the minds of people who are swayed by the dark forces. It is time to cultivate the seeds of democracy and hope in them.

And for God's sake Democrats, please do not nominate a woman in 2028. This has not gone well. Please rally and fall in line behind Gavin Newsom (Edit: However, if I could personally get 30 seconds with Michelle Obama, I can give her an elevator pitch why she must join his ticket as the VP candidate - this powerful combo is enough to propel to a convincing victory in 2028). For fucks sake, win the election and hold the office long enough so that people get enough time to detox from this garbage. It is time for the Democrats to keep their petty egos and their silly squabbles aside, and rally and unify the forces behind a winning ticket. Get started now.

"First, to uphold the perceived legitimacy of the institution. Keep in mind that the Supreme Court basically invented its own power. Judicial review isn’t in the constitution. The Supreme Court just kind of decided they get to do that, everyone else mostly just went along with it, and since it’s been centuries, nobody really questions it. At the end of the day, the Supreme Court relies on everyone else respecting it and collectively agreeing to continue the game of make believe. One of the big things that makes that possible is the perception that the Justices aren’t politicians and strive to be serious and judgmanlike. If you start loading the bench with youngsters naked power grab style, it pulls the curtain back and people start questioning why we’re listening to philosopher kings. Politicians don’t want that because they know that when the ideological balance of the court is in their favor that it benefits them. 

Secondly, it makes them more of an unknown quantity. People’s political beliefs can change significantly between young adulthood and death.

To retain any chance of power Biden needed to immediately recognize he was probably going to just be a one-term President anyway. He needed to hit the ground running with aggressive moves to counter Republicans. 

Instead he kept trying to pretend Republicans were still just good buddies he happened to disagree with from time to time. And now we all pay the price.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"Sadly, that ship sailed a while ago. 

This has been a decades long ""legal"" coup. Thank the Heritage Foundation, The Federalist Society, and Citizens United. 

The GOP ""won"" Trump's first term. They suffered zero consequences for the 8 years of blatant obstructionism against a sitting president, found the perfect amorale demagogue to be an obvious distraction while they stacked the court in their favor and accelerated their plans. 

DJT has pretty much outlived his usefulness to the GOP. Sure, they'll let him have a couple years to fill his pockets and throw his temper tantrum but count on them 25th Amendment'ing him, probably with a full pardon, around the 2 year mark and installing Vance. If they do that then Vance can ""legally"" run for two terms free and clear. Vance is essentially a spineless puppet and worse, relatively young. He can linger for a long time.

Expect some of the older SC to ""retire"" and be replaced with younger conservative judges who are all in for the big win. That's assuming the GOP doesn't add  more judges as well. 

So we'd have 2 more years of DJT and a decade of Vance. A lot will depend on how successful DJT is at dismantling the checks and balances this time around. There was a lot of internal pushback his first term. This time around he's going to pre-emptively eliminate as much of it as he can in the first few weeks after he's sworn in.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"I'm going to give an optimistic take:

I don't think it will be worse. Alito and Thomas have consistently been the most egregiously far right justices on this court, by a long shot. If you look at who Trump appointed, Amy Coney Barrett,  Brett Kavanagh, and Gorsuch have actually been more moderate voices. They are definitely giving wins to Republicans, sure, but we've actually seen them (along with Roberts) actually side with the liberals on the court on a number of occasions. We've seen this court actually hand down losses to Trump himself. They are not blindly following the Republican marching orders, though they are obviously sympathetic to them. Through that, Alito and Thomas have been stalwart supporters of Republican policy agenda even when the rest of the court is rebuking it. They are actually the worst.

So I actually think that Trump's history of supreme court picks might yield better replacements to those two justices were they to retire. 

Now I know what everyone will say: Trump will appoint young people that will be there forever, and he has a Republican Congress this time so he can put whoever he wants. That's true. I don't think, though, that we will see anyone as bad as either Alito or Thomas. I really think we're going to see more of the Coney-Barrett brand. Therefore, I think the court will get better for us in the near term. It won't be good, but it won't be *worse*. The long term, obviously, will not be ideal as we will have no chances of replacing a justice of our own. That I can't positively spin.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Dems are pathetic for not coming out to vote when they needed to for a canidate that fucking frankly reddit sucked the dick of entirely too much (her policy platform WAS NOT COMPREHENSIVE OR STRONG and a TON of redditors and powers that be keep repeating it was like it'll make it true) and liberals overall are pathetic for constantly magnifying the line about Harris and genocide and then allowing Trump to win. The genocide will proceed with no hope to be stopped and we will watch. Ever notice how Harris only offered soulless canned responses to Gaza but got animated about Trump? God, I wonder how hard it must be to be stuck watching a nightmare play out, unable to change the policy of a sitting fossil of a President that thinks what worked in the 70s still works today and unable to voice any commitments to Palestinians because you are still the sitting VP. Americans are obviously too stupid to govern themselves. They can't make capable decisions. They constantly embarass the whole country.





What do you think happens next? Palestinians aren't being allowed to leave. The abuse is going to accelerate to paving the west bank. Immigrants in the US will also be deported until we can't get rid of them, then we'll look into nastier methods and people will finally be able to wrap their tiny fucking skulls around the beginning of the Holocaust and not just the 5 seconds of it people remember from high school. Americans, even liberal ones, are delighted to not recall how things began and just think a switch is flipped where it is suddenly bad. Not the case. You have enabled the beginning of something terrible.





Trans people will likely be forced to detransition and their mental health crisis will deeply harm many of them beyond repair.





None of it made sense voting wise. The issues people were made about will all accelerate under Donald. Like he said, people are too fucking stupid to know how to vote and weigh complex issues, it's always the ""Me, Me, Me"" of my life and nothing else. Just like the boomers, a line I bet my goddamn life people my age don't want to hear. People with strong emotions vote in ways that don't make sense but it validates their emotions and that was probably nice to be able to proudly tell your friends prior to her losing. I didn't even like her, I detested her and voted for her sheerly for harm reduction. Maybe actual fascism will remind people their vote means something but I doubt it. Not until people are starving will they finally break away from their day-to-day 24/7 distractions and consider their country and other countries. And as I understand it, the swathes of people outraged didn't vote for some fucking mind addling reason. Probably because they're just stupid. They could have at least voted for de la Cruz and got us going in the right direction, but no. Just staying home, Gen Z in particular.

The Dems do need to change, but they can't save America from itself if voters won't do the basic civic requirements of being educated on issues and using basic logic in decision making.  America is like a formerly strong business that is now staffed mostly by incompetent employees: doomed to go belly up eventually.

City folks don't care about rural folks either way.  The rural folks just watch media that tells them that liberals hate them and they are too insular to know better.  Honestly, they can cry about it all they want.  If that made them vote that way, they are probably a lost cause.  The Dems will be fine with their education and higher incomes.

"It sounds like that bi-partisan immigration bill that Trump killed would have helped with this issue. 

As for your other gripes:

-The American Rescue Plan

-Bi-partisan infrastructure Plan

- CHIPS Act

-Inflation Reduction Act


Looking forward at Kamala’s proposals:
-Expand the child tax credit

-First time home buyer assistance 

-Address corporate landlord price fixing

-Tax credits for health care premiums

-Raise the minimum wage

-Eliminate the tax on tips

-Paid family and medical leave

-DOUBLE the number of apprenticeships
 
-End four year college requirement for federal jobs

"Perception is reality and the reality is the Dems have no voice besides their own personal circlejerk.  No one knows shit about what you mention.

I bet 90% of non-liberals have no idea about that immigration bill.  Dems got rolled on and just took it in the ass and let the GOP control the narrative.  musta been a shitty bill since no one made a big deal of it. 

Reminds me of when McConnell blocked Obama’s SCOTUS nomination.  If it were a big deal Obama would said something about it.  Dems woulda made a big deal about scotus in that election.  Same with Russian interference in 2016.  If it were a big deal Obama would have said something about it before the election not after his team lost

If inflation wasnt all Biden’s fault then I think someone woulda  pointed out that worldwide inflation  was higher.  But they didn’t so that means Biden caused it all. Russian invasion spiked oil prices and other commodities drought affected crops but Biden admin didn’t say shit so must be Biden’s  fault.    And why are we in then Ukraine anyways. I have no clue Biden never told me anything.  Trump woulda been on Twitter everyday screaming “I know prices are high but America defends freedom and democracy and strong Americans sacrifice for the good of the world” or some shit.  But no, the “smart”folks don’t say shit. 

All I know is if Trump were POTUS he’d be crowing every day about how our inflation was lower than the worlds.  Beating it into people’s heads how good we were doing about how awesome our oil industry was picking up the slack.  Instead we got the weak-ass liberals saying fuck all.  People still think we banned fracking and oil industry is in shambles and that’s why oil when up when the complete opposite is true",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"As a cancer patient at risk of losing healthcare access, thanks Trump, his supporters and the millions who decided we all deserve to suffer. I’m going to fight to stay around long enough for my children to have a chance at the world they deserve because they and many other children don’t deserve destruction because a bunch of jackasses can’t do better.

I’ve been really pondering what’s worse to think about. My health or this society crumbling. Death is a great equalizer and if this condition makes a turn because I lose coverage or just our healthcare system overloads from the idiots making decisions I will be free from its effects but I know my last thoughts will be worry for the world my children will be left to battle. 

It’s been a rough week and sadly, I got in for my check up next week to see if the treatments are still working so it’s been a rollercoaster in my head.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"I'll be honest, I saw a post in another thread suggesting that they may try to gut Medicaid in order to push more people into Marketplace policies. By forcing work requirements for Medicaid recipients this could force more people into Marketplace policies. They could then drop the subsidies to make it substantially more expensive to pay premiums.

This would cut into populations that qualified for Medicaid under it's expansion in many states.  We've already seen Marketplace enrollment rise after the Medicaid redeterminations which shows people are going to try and sustain health coverage to an extent even if they have to pay for Marketplace premiums. How much people would be willing to pay for premiums is another question.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

We all knew that this the system was rendered unsalvageable by corruption years ago.

Since crossing the line, we’ve been slowly sliding towards the edge, without a shot at redemption because every artery of the political system was clogged by grifters, 3rd party interests, and establishmentarianism.

The people responsible, we have allowed to remain in power and to consolidate and subvert every check and balance over the course of decades.

We were unwilling to take the necessary steps required to even have a shot at saving ourselves, and now we are finished.

"It will.  There is a good discussion on the medicine subreddit about how project 2025 will affect healthcare.  Hint, its gonna be bad. 

Lifetime caps on medicaid, privatization and funding cuts to medicare.  Plus, medicare literally funds physician training in this country.  The ACA is gone or gutted, remember preexisting conditions?  Oh, and they also want to privatize medicaid. 

Pediatric coverage will suffer massively as well.  medicaid covers a insanely large proportion of children as they often qualify even if their parents do not. 

They are going to eliminate facility fee differentials.  You know, the extra funding that keeps rural hospitals open. 

There are also going to be reimbursement cuts, possible loss of PSLF, loss of income based loan payments, and privatization of student loans. The average student debt from med school is ~$200k.  But, the average med student has at least 1 physician parent and takes out less.  Most PCPs are first generation doctors with less family support (not having an insider in the system makes it difficult to hit the ground running and be able to be competitive for specialization) so they take out more in debt, often around $400k for less well paid primary care jobs.  This will either force people out of primary care and into urgent care which pays better, or force PCPs to have even shorter visits and provided worse care.  

The only thing positive is they may reverse the ban on physician's owning hospitals. Which was lobbied for by the healthcare corporations prior to the ACA.  Most data now shows that physician owned hospitals had better patient outcomes.  They tended to have slightly longer stays and lower readmit rates, thanks to not rushing patients out the door as quick as possible.  But, not like that will matter when no one can afford care.

But, this will hurt everyone terribly and accelerate the collapse of our healthcare system from a long slow death to a quick one.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

But there are many of us who make too much for that but not enough to be able to afford the absolutely crushing costs of insurance. We use ACA subsidies to make it work.

Related: when people talk about moving away from the USA with Trump 2.0 in charge, it’s not because we’re abandoning the country or turning our backs on it because we didn’t win, as Biden said in his recent remarks about the peaceful transition of power. It’s because the economic realities are leaving us no other choice. I wish Biden and others understood this. I have family who have already left the US and another relative invested in leaving (as in bought property, building on that property in Central America) and are, as of Tuesday’s results, moving up their plans to do so sometime in the upcoming year.

"That’s not entirely true.  I’m a health insurance broker of over 20 years, and before the ACA was put in place, we had AB 1672 (here in CA), which meant you could not be declined for pre existing conditions with an employer sponsored health plan.

There are 2 very obvious problems with that, and the ACA fixed them.  

First, insurance companies could adjust a companies Risk Adjustment Factor (RAF) if the group experienced a high amount of medical claims.  This caused a lot of rates to skyrocket for everyone within a single employer group because it only takes a couple of people to get sick and rack up a lot of claims.

Second, as an example, if someone were to be diagnosed with terminal cancer, they would obviously not be able to work forever, so when they are too sick to work and lose their job, they lost their coverage, and Cobra only extends coverage for 18 months.  Those people are then basically just left to die, because they were then considered uninsurable on the individual market.

I made a hell of a lot more money doing what I do pre ACA, but I was happy to take an 80% pay cut and work my way back because I got to help people cover their families and get the care they need when they couldn’t before.  As much as Reddit hates insurance, the ACA is invaluable for the collective, and if it’s removed, we’re going to have a very bad time.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

It's interesting hearing how conflicted the messaging already is from inside Trump world. Elon is in.. No he's out.  Steven Miller is talking about de-naturalization and mass deportations, but people say he's not ""in"" the admiration so he's just talking.

This is going to look less like a cabinet of decision makers and more like a bunch of vultures cleaning the bones of a carcass and there will never be a clean signal on what the plans are and which are ""official"" and which are just people talking.

"Part of me figures Trump knows about 2025 but doesn't care. He has his own agenda that doesn't involve it. His views align with it but he definitely isn't a religious zealot. I imagine he's going to spend his time golfing and enriching himself while letting everyone else do their own thing.



Senate and house historically take ages to pass anything. Even on a blueprint, they've got to find an agreement to get things passed and, moreover, they have to remember Trump doesn't have to worry about re-election. They do. And in 2 years for most of them.



Passing just PART of 2025 such as repealing medicaid/medicare would have the most inept ill-informed person aware that the GOP did this, and that they are NOT voting GOP next time because of how much their meds have gone up in price under them.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

What has truly happened  is going to take a while to sink in for most Americans. That was our political reality for all our lives. We don't know anything else. There was always the chance to change things in 4 years or 8 years or by having reps in the branches of the fed.

That's why it was so easily to make the 'Trans girls in girls sports' thing such a big attack against democrats despite it affecting the most narrow slice of people. 

Democrats need to take from this that America is slower to change its attitudes than we thought and refocus on economic issues that affect the middle. You can't fight for social issues if you never get elected in the first place

Whether you want to admit it or not, knowing how a vote is going to turn out, then having a way to get fake ballots in to change that vote after it's been mostly counted is a very good way to swing an election fraudulently if someone had the logistical capability to do so.

"They are. Think about it - they know that their policies will result in the loss of the majority of the farm and construction labor forces. They know that someone is going to have to pick their crops. They know that footage of American farmers whose crops are rotting in the fields because they can’t bring the harvest in won’t play well in middle America, especially when people’s costs are skyrocketing due to the tariffs they’ve imposed. 

They know they will need to find labor to work the farms. And hey now here we have a captive population that is constitutionally permitted to be forced to work in the fields. Farmers’ costs for labor go down, because these workers are no longer paid, look at us helping the American farmer! 

The camps are the goal. It’s slavery rebooted. We managed to lose the Cold War and the civil war all at once.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"This was initially a bit surprising, but now it makes a lot of sense. We have basically 2 years of high school students that recently graduated and voted this coming election. Both of these groups of people either went through college in lockdown or didn't go to college because of lockdown.

In other words, when trump defunded pandemic response teams, which turned an endemic, like covid into a pandemic that killed eight million people and shut down the global economy and caused global inflation everywhere...

Well, one of the unintended side effects was that an entire generation of young voters, which initially leaned significantly hard left, became isolated and easily divided by social media, specifically, by Russian, Iranian and Chinese influences on social media.

Bottom line, money in politics and the ability for foreign Nationals like musk and Murdoch, to own social media or just traditional news media should be a violation of the communications act but again, money in politics allowed this to become a full blown national security threat due the highly effective propaganda they deliver to individuals rather than groups. They are strategically able to convert people who are most vulnerable during isolation. Periods like a pandemic...

And very few people decide afterwards that their voting choice was a mistake...,2024_11_09,05_18_26
"It’s absolutely baffling to me that people are surprised that young men are turning to “bro media” and breaking for Trump. Look, I have voted straight ticket Democrat in every single election including this one but as a 36 year old Millennial white male from a lower-middle class socioeconomic background, I’m gonna let you in on my experience.

All throughout high school I worked my ass off to get a full academic scholarship to a state school while seeing women and minorities get similar scholarships for much less effort and with fewer accomplishments. 

All throughout college seeing the same thing happen with internships and undergraduate research positions (engineering major). I was even specifically told by my academic advisor that despite being top of my class, I shouldn’t even bother applying for summer research grants because they will preferentially go to women and minorities. 

Coming out of college, women even at the bottom of the class getting instant job placement and competitive offers while men of every class rank had enormous trouble finding a job during the 2010 recession.

And I understand the historical need for all of that but while all this is happening, pop culture is blaring messages in our faces at all times that men are privileged little shits and women are oppressed. That we need to fight the “patriarchy” and give up our “privilege” when we’ve seen an enormous amount of that privilege being given in the opposite direction.

I don’t doubt that I have enjoyed privileges as a white man but there is an outright refusal of feminist groups and other progressive organizations to acknowledge the privileges that women and minorities also have today. Supposedly it’s all about “equality” but we’re constantly told we need to fight for everyone else and we can fuck off with our own concerns. This is pissing a lot of young men off.

And while social media is growing, all of these messages have intensified while young men see the scales continue to tip in women’s favor. Currently, a significant majority of all college degrees are awarded to women, and before marriage and kids, women outearn men by something like 30%. Why isn’t this being attributed to sexism? Instead, all we ever hear about is needing more women in STEM and a “wage gap” that only exists when you badly distort the data. Add to that the wildly bigoted shit that is said about men in social media with absolutely no backlash. Like can you even imagine the shit storm that would happen if the “man vs bear” debate was referring to any sort of racial/ethnic/gender group other than (white) men?

But we can’t point any of this out without being shouted down with accusations of mansplaining and “toxic masculinity” or being called incels. 

So in comes “bro media” and most of them are shit head grifters but they are the ONLY ones talking to young men and saying “We hear you” and “we empathize with your concerns” without also tearing them down, overtly or implicitly, about privilege, patriarchy or whatever the lingo of the day is. They are the ONLY ones who aren’t constantly blaming them for things they never did nor contributed to. Think about it, when is the last time you’ve heard an actual positive message directed to men that didn’t also include backhanded criticism of their gender? When people find out about my voting record they’ll say things like “men are terrible but at least you’re one of the good ones”, can you imagine saying that about any other group of people other than men?

So this is a learning experience, and you’re not going to like hearing it, but a lot of you need to let go of your ego and tone down the self-righteous anger, you’re not the focus of this conversation. Right now it’s important to just sit down, shut up and listen. Then you need to earnestly talk to young men and hear their concerns without making it all about yourself.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

But those young men were still the most likely to vote for Harris. Men aged 30-44 went 53-43 for Trump. But we're not seeing a thousand think pieces about how Millennial men are going full MAGA.

"As a Gen X’er, it’s concerning to see how disconnected many Gen Z’ers are from the political realities that will shape their future. Growing up in the digital age, they’ve been influenced by viral content and memes, but this often overshadows the deeper understanding of issues like tariffs, economics, and government institutions.

For instance, when politicians talk about 50% or 100% tariffs, many young people mistakenly see it as a discount. But in reality, tariffs raise prices for consumers, hurt working-class families, and don’t necessarily bring back jobs as promised. They also fail to understand the long-term impacts of their votes—particularly when it comes to issues like the Supreme Court, reproductive rights, LGBTQIA+ protections, and government programs.

Many in Gen Z also lack basic civics knowledge. Ask them about the three branches of government, and they might struggle to answer. Without this foundational knowledge, how can they understand the stakes of their votes?

It’s easy to vote based on who seems “relatable” or “cool,” but policies matter more than personalities. Elections have real-world consequences, and if Gen Z isn’t careful, they may find their rights and freedoms slipping away due to uninformed choices. It’s time to move beyond memes and social media culture and take a hard look at how their vote can shape the future.

IMO I think Gen Z they saw Trump get shot as some warrior victim. And the victim mentality is strong in this generation. He saw him be goofy  and that translated as relatable vs ineptness. 

And as it is trending many did not know Biden was no longer a candidate. 

What they yet get is SCOTUS and how that works. That if they rely on any lunch program, have a friend here illegally, want to marry a same sex person, become pregnant, is LGBTQIA+ , the climate they voted for the wrong party. These are all topics that Gen X continues to espouse that they support.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

You had 90s era right wing news that morphed into full on tabloid level conspiracy. 1996 Fox > 2000 stolen election > 2008 propaganda era > 2012 social media era > 2016 Trump > 2020 insurrection > 2024 Trump 2. 

I don't get it either but I guess it comes down to Republican voters beliefs not falling in line with their actions + never getting exposed to any of the facts because of limited media consumption. 30 years ago it would be laughable, just outlandish to suggest that the 2024 Republican candidate would be a guy who praised Hannibal Lecter, talked about Arnold Palmer's penis size, and pretended to give a blowjob to a mic at a rally, AND had a VP running mate who had multiple pictures circulating of him wearing women's clothing.

"I believe this post to be 100% accurate and a huge reason the election turned the way it did. I also think that parents and moderates may simply be voting similarly based on the GenZ experience that they witnessed for their own children.

I’ve read through a lot of the comments in this thread and believe that we have just hit the inflection point of pushing the equality pendulum too far. I say this as a 0.1% who has had the luxury of voting for things like global warming, women’s reproductive rights, and ethics.  As I read these comments and reflect on them, I see their point and cannot fault them for it.  

I’m currently reflecting on the process of college applications. For large state schools, the most common essay asked had to do with explaining how you are diverse and what diversity you will bring to the university. Also true for private schools.

This question is the results of decades of “social progress”, which is now explicit.  Yet that question contains a very strong reverse implicit bias, or a micro aggression towards white males.  These are the terms used in DEI, but in reverse. They make white males feel guilty about out how/what they communicate with others.

In regards to the essay, being a white male in an upper class neighborhood means you have to dig deep to put something on there that you think the university wants to hear. Growing up playing organized sports going to the lake on the weekend, traveling to see national parks, or other countries is probably not what an admissions committee is looking for, or thats what the implicit bias is.

Sure I understand that some demographics may not have access to the same resources and education, but it doesn’t change the fact that the Gen Z kids had nothing to do with all of that.  Yet indirectly, though essay prompts like above, they have grown up feeling that they are part of the problem.  

in fact, the word “Incel” is just another thing that will reinforce their feelings.  

This sentiment is also expanding outside of GenZ and white males.  There was a huge article written by NYT recentyl about DEI at the University of Michigan and how it actually has had some reverse effects. Specifically resentment that it needed to be explicitly acknowledged discussed and upfront in every corner of the university from undergraduate to super advanced scientific fields.  The point being that those fields probably don’t really need/want to spend much time or energy talking about social programs.  Also, resentment towards minorities simply as a result of this additional work.

So for huge swaths of the country outside of the coasts, this has been their experience. I think that if some of this   “progress” didn’t exist, many of them would’ve voted for a female of mixed descent.  Suggesting that people are racist, misogynist or uneducated as a result of the election certainly does nothing to bring them back to the middle. It’s a simple reinforcement of why they voted the way they did. I didn’t understand it before. But I think I do now.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"You've said it. I'm also 36, grew up during same era. Same thing, see it even today at work when we celebrate certain classes of people getting jobs over other people, even prioritize to.

First, young men these days are being told they need to pay for the sins of their fathers and grandfathers. That's just wrong and nobody should be surprised that the majority aren't willing to take that. Of course we should work to fix the injustices of the past, but that fix cannot mean elevating certain demographics at the expense of others. 

Second, there are *real* problems that men are facing today and nobody on the left is willing to even entertain the idea of discussing them. 80% of all suicides are men. 70% of homeless people that cannot get a spot in a shelter are men. 75% of opioid addicts are men. Men face higher rates of unemployment. We can go on and on.  I'm not saying the left should throw all their energy on solving these problems, but can we at least acknowledge they're real problems worth exploring? The right is willing to engage in this conversation. The left is not, to their great detriment.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"I’m a woman more than 20 yrs older than you..always vote Dem, and you describe your experiences well and I understand the backlash against all the “privilege “ talk. It has gone too far.  It’s as if the achievements of white men are outrightly dismissed in some sectors since they are viewed as being achieved through privilege. 

Since I’m a bit older, my experiences were different in that my male high school guidance counselor in the mid 1980’s discouraged me from majoring in biology since I would have to take physics and chemistry classes with boys (his words) and suggested I enter secretarial school or nursing school. I didn’t do that and have a PhD in biology instead.  It wasn’t that long ago that females in college were at a disadvantage. A woman I worked with (since retired) had a Dean physically push her up against a wall when she was a student because she dared register for a physics class. And yes this was in the US. 

So maybe most people feel they must push against some tide or outside discouragement and rightfully resent it. We need to recognize it all.  There has been a shift. Hopefully we can right things.

"It was crazy to watch the discourse over movies and videogames lean heavily into identity politics and right wing talking points in real time. Gamer gate was the start, but the big shift for movies really came in 2017 when The Last Jedi came out, and all these YouTubers and influencers realized they could harness way more engagement by fostering rage in a way that appeals to their biggest demographic; impressionable white 14 year old boys.

Same thing in 2020, when The Last of Us part 2 came out, and the discourse about that game revolves around trans and gay characters for MONTHS before the game came out.

They turned movies and videogames into a fucking battlefront against windmills.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"This is not stressed enough. Gamergate was the prototype for today’s social media/political discourse. A lot of the attitudes expressed by angry right wing folks were bubbling to the surface but people thought they were trolls. 

Its effects are still happening today. So much chatter and noise about how this or that game is “woke” because the main character is a woman or a minority and it dominates online discussions. People screaming about “censorship” in their games because they put shorts on a character that didn’t have them before. Ugh, that’s just the tip of the iceberg.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

The push for accountability in this space has flipped the narrative from believe men because there’s no evidence to believe women because evidence is hard to come by and it’s statistically likely that they are telling the truth. In turn, young men are directly or inadvertently being told they are toxic monsters on the prowl and have understandably responded with anger. There’s a narrative that men are being profiled in the name of accountability and women aren’t being held accountable at all. 

So in turn, men have voted in retaliation for a short term victory while enabling policies that harm women wholesale thus continuing the cycle of women fearing men and handling all male strangers at arms length.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"""The space we have created for men...""

I don't agree. As a white man I've never felt like I couldn't do something because of my race or gender, unlike women and PoC that I know where for them feeling unwelcome in some spaces is a legitimate concern. Most of my hobbies are dominated by white men, most of the places I work are led by white men, I have never been anywhere where I feel unsafe because I'm a white man. The de facto state of almost everything is and has been catered to white men. 

The ""manosphere"" *is* appealing because they say ""Oh no you poor baby you've been criticized for the first time in your life. It's not your fault, everyone else is wrong."" They're grifters preying on backlash towards the concept that everyone (not just men) should be able to live their lives and do the things they want to do without fear of repercussions. 

It shouldn't be the responsibility for everyone else to coddle men who are stuck in their feelings because someone somewhere made a video game that wasn't explicitly made for them, or someone somewhere made a point about the injustices they face in everyday life because of their race or gender.

Steve Bannon took his strategy directly from Gamergate, and a lot of young men are looking for solutions to their loneliness online and in those spaces still. 

Women can find community and connection in their female friendships. Men tend to get into relationships and then depend on that one woman for all of their emotional needs.

Make male gamers feel like they're owed sex from women by making them feel like their hobbies are a negative to women. Make them feel like their online loneliness is because women aren't fucking them.

That is what the Republican party has been building up for 20 years.

DNC has to look inward, stop the gate keeping, and make change. A campaign message of “I’m not him,” is not compelling, regardless of how correct it may be morally. You have to listen to your audience, know them, and meet them. Harris’s campaign did not do that, and the data backs it up.

"It started with a guy upset at his girlfriend for cheating on him with several men. They were both indie game devs. Some of the men she had an affair with were in the games press.

It then was about how the gamepress was too cozy with developers and publishers. The games press pushed back hard and started to attack the people who consumed their writing. Eventually, the games press did start to call out conflicts of interest and not provide coverage to games where they had a personal relationship with the subject they were writing about. If you wanted to read a review for any consumer product, you don't want to read one written by a guy paid by the company that made it. Or written by someone who's significant other stands to make money off the sale of the item.

But pretty quickly, the gamegate discussion was taken over by two groups of grifters that were basically the early culture war drivel. I won't get into it, but there was a lot of horrible people on both sides of that coin spouting vile shit for years. 

People who were there because of the gamepress stuff bailed out quickly. The people fighting the culture war basically became the Alt right. Bannon worked/owned Brietbart at the time. They were the defacto news source for gamergate. Bannon made his money, hiring people in China to farm gold in mmo's. Bannon ran one of the largest game gold and accounts selling websites in the world. He was the one that turned the gamergate  vitrol into support for trump.

Today, the alt right is mainstream. The vileness and hate from gamergate is what we see as some of the main platforms of the GOP. Misogyny, racism, homophobia, distrust of the media.

The gamepress never really recovered from attacking their readers in general. It is all but gone at this point, replaced by youtubers. Those left seem to be on the cusp of being replaced by AI.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

The narrative I see in male spaces is that the first group is the largest which I don't really see evidence for but it's still the one that the opposition is created against.

I think, to some degree, ""boys will be boys"" and trying to ignore that fact or demonizing it in whole will effectively reject that audience. Guys bitching about their girl problems or theorizing how to get laid *is the norm* among young men, but in a lot of leftist spaces this behavior is ridiculed, or rejected as a topic of conversation (in fairness this is the more common approach) but comparable topics for women are usually tolerated.

To be clear I don't think the left is anti-young-men, the vast majority of spaces are largely inclusive to them - but I think the left is missing some big opportunity and lacks some key niche spaces. I think it'd help to accept the fact that it's normal for young men to be immature fucks, and to take what audience / gains we can get instead of outright rejecting it on principle.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"This, in general, is a big problem the left has in all aspects of politics and society. I dare say it's THE reason democrats lost the election. It's very hard to break complicated issues down into one or two sentences, but your average American (not just young people) can't/won't focus longer than that. So they, in this case young men, will follow the people shouting short easy-to-understand solutions. ""It's the brown people's fault!"", ""It's women being unfair!"", etc.

I wish I had a solution. Best I can do is educate my own kids before they go out in the world",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"> The 18 to 25 year old white and Latino men aren’t responsible for slavery. 

Yes, I know, none of them are. But being a descendent from slave owners isn't the issue, it's the misogyny and violence that are the problem. Voting for Trump doesn't dispel the notion that young men support misogyny and violence against women.

> They can’t afford food or housing. Only a very few elite are actually privileged, millionaires and billionaires are the true privileged.

"Agreed. Harris was at her most popular when she was voicing all of the grievances the left/non-right had over Trump. I don't know if she would've won with that, but maybe the Democrats need to tap into that frustration their voting base has.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"I was just saying after the election so much for all those 'Republicans who are voting Harris!' on this sub, or people with Republican family members who were definitely voting Harris.

">Jen Psaki: ""There was an over-listening to and an over-lifting up of people who left Trump, not people who left the Democratic Party. The people who left the Democratic party are going to win in the future. The people who left Trump, the never Trumpers, who have important voices—that is not the winning coalition.""

You'd think Democrats would've learned that lesson in 2016 when Hillary was making overtures to never Trumpers only for Trump to win anyways. Kamala Harris spent this whole campaign chasing never Trumpers, all 3 of them. Campaigning with Liz Cheney, touting Dick Cheney's endorsement, saying the only change she'd make from Biden is adding a Republican to her cabinet.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"I agree. It seemed most of the last month was trying to get endorsements from Never Trump and disaffected Republicans and celebrities.  

There wasn’t much messaging or talking about issues that really concerned Americans.  

It started out feeling like 2008, but it ended feeling more like 2016.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
"Maybe. Perhaps some.

But mostly sexism. ""Benefit of the doubt"" is a powerful tool for Trump being a rich white male.  He walked into most rooms and got inherent trust, he didn't have to prove anything. This is from decades of media, tv, and movies that show people like him in positions that have inherent trust. And this is a programming we have all received: this is why legal immigrants with relatives including parents who may be undocumented still voted for Trump. I mean, damn. Cause Trump is the everyman, the savior! He always means well, that's the movies tell me.

Don't brush this off. It's a very deep subconscious bias. Think of your favorite movies. This is why Elon and Joe Rogan, and similar cries ""woke"" anytime someone like Trump or him \*aren't\* in protagonist or leadership roles, because they get anxiety when anyone else, like women, are seen at the helm. It's just status quo stuff. You likely get some anxiety too, it's not your fault, it's just your brain has trouble processing it because it's not used to seeing it.

F' the coal-smudged, downtrodden worker. That person was not going to listen to Kamala Harris, nor Hillary Clinton. Kamala didn't have a chance with these people. Trump just had tools at his disposal (including media sane-washing) that Clinton and Harris will never have, or not have for a long time, due to US media programming.

Get off X.

"I strongly suspect that the number of Democrats who ended up voting for Trump greatly exceeded the number of Republicans who ended up voting for Harris.

Harris' obsession with trying to win votes from Republicans probably didn't cost her the election, but it certainly didn't help either.  Also, she may have alienated part her base by going to such lengths to go after Republican votes.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Everyone hates that guy, there is a movie about how much of an asshole he is- and the Harris campaign championed and promoted that endorsement?

"I'd say about 30% of Americans are unreachable on the right, the other 30% are firmly on Democrats side and the middle 40% are who national campaigns try to reach. That 40% doesn't give a shit about race or sex politics except how it effects them personally, isn't happy with the state of the country or economy and feels basically unheard. Some of them are left of Democrats, very few are as far right as the Republican party.

The Democrats problem is they ignore basically that entire 40%. They pander to their base and try to win the other sides base. They say ""look, we're not leftist, see! We won't rock the boat, we're stable!"" The problem being that the boat itself isn't working for those people. The Republicans say ""we'll change things!"" The Democrats say ""everything's fine, you're wrong for the way you feel!"". That's where we're at.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"The basic premise of democracy is that the elected representatives govern with the consent of the people. In the United States, around Donald Trump and his extreme brand of politics, a new model has emerged whereby a victory in an election is to be interpreted as carte blanche for subjugating and punishing the losing side.

This is not the system that Americans signed up for, implicitly or otherwise. It is true that under the rules of democracy, no political faction is supposed to get their own way all the time. But defeat in an election, was never supposed to an event as monumental and catastrophic, as military defeat and occupation by a foreign power. And yet the feeling of most Democrats now, seems to be the same as that of the man in a famous photograph who watched the Nazis march into Paris.

If Trump and his allies refuse to respect any of the norms, traditions and conventions of America, then why should other Americans feel bound by them? Why should they feel locked into a system that the Republicans have disregarded and reduced to a cruel mockery?

The Democrats have a substantial power base in the blue states. They also have a lot of young, active, capable people. Isn’t it time to divorce yourselves from these neighbours who *hate* you and define themselves around their hatred for you?

Start a new country. Forward-looking, with a new and better constitution. Then there will be hope again.

"Two other writers, Coppola producing, Universal Pictures funding and overseeing. George was a young director so he had little or no power to override changes and executive decisions, so with a little luck it turned into a good little film.

Like Star Wars. The bigger budget and controversial nature of the film meant he did not have nearly the control over it he would later have. Here's how it was described to me by people who were there:

SW4 - Lucas has maybe 25% control.

SW5 - Lucas has maybe 50% control, but shared with an Academy Award winning legendary director, Irvin Kershner, and one of the greatest Academy Award winning screenwriters of all time, Lawrence Kasdan -- who is the one who turned Lucas on to the Hero of a 1,000 Faces heroic myth structure and made Darth Luke's father and Leia Luke's sister, etc.

SW6 - Lucas had 75% control and went back to directing himself...and about the middle of that movie everything turns to shit.

The truth is that Lucas combined classic WW1/2 dogfights with the adventure serials he grow up with. But the person who understood why those worked and how to put them together was not Lucas. It was everyone else put on the films to guide and control George.

"So many confidently incorrect kids here.

This is absolutely possible, though the processes and laws differ depending on rank. I'll briefly go over what it would look like for 3/4 star Generals.

In their case, those ranks come from their position and the Prez has broad authority to appoint officers, thougy there is Senate approval. Technically the Prez can nominate any O6+ to a 3/4 Star position if the Senate's cool with it.

If the Prez removes someone from a 3/4 Star position and doesn't place them in another that provides them that rank, they revert to their original rank (the highest permanent rank is 2 star).

"> ""and puts in place his own rabid loyalists.""

Are you talking about higher up in command ?.. or day to day grunt soldiers ?

I think the problem this creates would depend a lot on how big the numbers are of soldiers being let go. (assuming we're talking about day to day grunt soldiers)

and:

* whether you're even able to replace them all 1 for 1

* and then you'd also have the problem of ""unit cohesion"" (just randomly scrapping together a bunch of ""rabid loyalists"" is 1 thing. Getting them to work effectively as a cohesive unit is another. 

* You'd also have the problem of skills and training (What if the random ""rabid loyalists"" you bring in, don't have the combination or stack of skills you need ?

* You'd also now have the problem of the people you let go,.. potentially feeling spurned (having expressed their loyal to the country and Constitution).. would almost invariably go directly to join the Resistance.

All the Insurrection Act does is allow the military to act as law enforcement when there is immediate threat of violence or deprivation of rights.,2024_11_09,05_18_26
"Well, I'm not a Constitutional Law Scholar,. so I can't claim I know the answer to that. I was reading a bit here: https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/insurrection-act-explained

.. which leaves me with an believe that the President can certainly invoke the Insurrection Act,.. although I'm left wondering how that would work out in a practical manner. 

The scenario I imagine in my head,. is that Trump would gin up some imaginary ""insurrection threat"" (say like he did saying ""Illegal immigrant gangs have taken over Aurora Colorado"").. what happens if he dispatches the Military there and when the military arrive,.. there's nothing to do ? (citizens obviously knowing this is coming.. would just hunker down and presumably it would have a chilling effect on public travel and daily activities. Then what ? (a little edit here:.. I would assume (again, perhaps naively) that the Military, when asked to go into what's being claimed is some kind of ""insurrection zone of disruption"" would ask or require ""intelligence"" or information up front as to what kind of threat they were facing ? (logistically and warfare fighting wise, you obviously want to know what you're driving into) What happens when Trump says ""INSURRECTION!"" and the Military gathers data and says.. ""What insurrection, sir?"")

How would a military-dispatch like that ""provide results"".. when they're given a fake or imaginary or vague ""just go find some immigrants to arrest"". 

I presume (and anyone can call me out if I'm missing something or just being incredibly naive).. but I just don't see much going to happen there if you send the military into a wild goose chase. 

A bit more plausible though might be sending the military to target specific individuals (whomever he labels as ""the enemy within"" as he now so often has). To me that's a little more clear cut example of an unlawful order that shouldn't be followed. (but again, I'm not Constitutional Law Scholar and we are way beyond ""unprecedented times' now) 

My feeling at this point (and again, I'm happy to listen to any well reasoned observations of how I might be wrong about this).. is that much of the aggression and antagonistic hate being spewed up on the right at the moment ---is purely being done to ""anger the libs"". ""creating fear"" (or ""creating an atmosphere of fear"" is (at least in my opinion) at the moment the thing they're most interested in. It's a terrorism tactic. They want to instill fear and obedience. (it's why they said ""it can be a bloodless revolution if the left allows it""). They expect the left to just ""lay down and take it"". 

As to how all this plays out and which groups align with whom... I honestly do not know. I'm definitely frightened by it. And deeply concerned. And angered. And motivated. The events of the past week or so,. basically spit in the face of all the concepts and ideals this country was founded on.",2024_11_09,05_18_26
no. it has to be a request from a state government.,2024_11_09,05_18_26
"I guess that all depends on whether the Military ""chain of command"" holds resilient or not. 

The law says ""they cannot be prosecuted"". 

So how would that even work. You can't take them to court or be courtmartialed,. there's no statute to convict them under ? (since ""dissenting"" is not illegal.. as the statute clearly says) 

So would they just start holding large numbers of military personal in the brig ?.. I mean.. I guess they could try, but again this comes back to whether the Military chain of command holds. You can't arrest a lower officer if a higher officer stands in your way. (or the officer above that.. and the officer above that. etc). But you can't really ""arrest the entire military"" either. 

Would the Secretary of Defense (currently Lloyd Austin) and all the other Secretaries of various military branches all hold strong ?.. I honestly don't even know their names, so I don't know how to answer that question. 

Even if Trump could do that.. all it does is create chaos. You could swap in new people,.. but (as I've mentioned in other comments), now you have a ""unit cohesion"" problem where all the new people you swapped in are strangers and have never worked together. 

I mean at that point you might as well just go ""full dictator"".. and unify the military under 1 umbrella or something insane. But that doesn't really get you away from all the same problems of ""Will people follow your commands?""...",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Doj doesn't prosecute military members. The military has their very own judicial system with their very own prisons and lawyers. The military absolutely will fight tooth and nail for their soldiers with their own lawyers at the behest of their command.

To expand, think of the military as its very own branch of government, the commander and chief directs the joint chiefs of staff and are updated by the joint chiefs. But by and large the power for the military is held by the joint chiefs of staff. 

Officers at the top in the military are greatly influenced by what happens in politics, and they are greatly beholden to the politics of being an officer. But those politics for promotion are largly seperate from normal politics. They over lap a bit, but for the most part, the military's going to do what it needs to do for itself to live and continue to be funded.

"Jebus do you get your history from TikTok? The Egyptian Revolution and its military’s role in it has zero resemblance to what we’re talking about.

The Generals were on Mubarak's side. He only fell once they concluded the military could not and *would not* stop the revolution. They threw him under the bus and withdrew their support to save themselves.

> *""The [leadership of the Egyptian armed forces] is not giving out orders that could be disobeyed, not even potentially. It knows it cannot ask its soldiers to do something they don’t want to do. If it asks soldiers to, say, fire on protesters, the [military heads] know it could end up with something like the Russian Revolution.”

"I'm not going lie and say it's all sunshine and rainbows right now. But there's a ton of work that the new Trump administration will have to get done to turn the US into a dicatorship, and i doubt it will happen within 2 years. 

With that said, your current concerns should absolutely be about which states your in, if it's republican led. Trump will give them free reign to supress their residents to whatever degree they wish. Any federal protections will likely be repealed. 

What will likely happen is that the federal government will now work with the states to enact terrible things upon the populations. States who are friendly to conservative ideals will absolutely pounce on any opportunity they're given to strip rights from citizens and denaturalize who they deem as their enemies. 

Democratic states will have to deal with the attempt of the federal government to infringe on states rights. If you're in a republican state. Now's the time to leave if you can, try to get to a democratic state if you can't outright leave the country. You'll fare better in one of those states. 

Remember, our system of government is comprised of a large federal government, 50 state governments, and of course we've got places like Peurto Rico who fall under US protections but aren't states and their systems of governance. 

Trumps presidency represents the beginning of a very large push that will likely result in even more rights being stripped away from every single american. This is going to be far worse than his first term. But our government is so widly complex with so many positions that are not beholden to the executive branch that he may not be able to enact Project 2025 in 2 years at best.

Everyone seems to forget that when Trump won in 2016, the GOP also won the Senate *and* the House. And what did they get done? Not much. They couldn't even end ACA.

The only thing that actually does concern me is his penchant for revenge. But, again, he is lazy, he is older in every way you can be, and he absolutely misses golfing all the time.

Even the things they're saying they're going to do aren't going to matter. Nobody seems to be thinking of the freaking logistics of a mass deportation. It would take so, so much planning. So much effort. SO much time and money! And all the while, more are coming over the border.

"The Richard Nixon approach. He was a US Senator from California, served as VP, and lost the presidential election while still sitting VP. 2 years later he ran for governor of California and lost. He said his political career was over and he'd never so much as hold a press conference again. 6 years later he was elected president.

Former Vice President's don't really run for anything other than President though. It's pretty rare you see anyone run for a lower office than what they've previously held. I think the last two to run for something else was Hubert Humphrey, who went back to the Senate for two terms (died in his 2nd term), and Nixon.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Surely you have noticed. Maybe you don’t care or even approve, but you know ow that this isn’t a nation that is moral or good anymore. It isn’t a place where neighbors help neighbors or where the strong stand up for the weak. Trump is the standard bearer for this America, but he isn’t what caused it.

Trump starts deporting people. Trump also pushes policy that gets stopped for being illegal, or unconstitutional. A lot of policy.   
When the economy starts to fail, Trump then pushes the narrative ""I told you so, this is why my policies should not have been blocked!""

The economy will stabilize some before anything Trump does even takes effect, Trump will get the credit. I say *some* because corporate greed is part of what's keeping prices high.

The tariffs will increase prices again, people who voted for him will be confused.

The deportations will also cause prices to increase, people who voted for him will be confused.

The deportations will partially cause the housing market to start to fall. Good for people still looking and for the real estate moguls who were already trying to buy everything. Bad for everyone who bought between 2020 and now.

I'm not going to make any real predictions related to P'25, because Trump voters seem mostly concerned with their own wallets over anything else, but I do think an attempt will be made to spread Christian Nationalism, which is incredibly unconstitutional.

"People say internment camps are a reach, like they wouldn’t actually happen in this country.

That’s because the schools basically don’t touch on the subject at all. In all my years of school, I only had ONE teacher briefly give a lesson on it, and by then I had already learned about it from Fort Minor.

"      Ok. The problem with dealing with Trump, is he lies so often, you never know if what he is saying will reflect what he will do. Let’s talk about illegal immigration. There is a system called “ E Verify”. This will absolutely flag anyone who is illegal , from getting a job. However, there is no federal law mandating this be used. Some states( like Illinois) only use it for some classes of state employees. Some, like Florida, require it for everybody. So why isn’t this being used as a tool to fight illegal immigration? The businesses that employ entry level workers cannot hire enough workers to fill their needs. If you deport every undocumented worker in the country( some have been here since the early 90’s) it will crash the economy. And not to mention all these people pay into social security, and will never receive benefits. Retirement for them, will be saving money and moving back to Mexico, etc. The problem is in 3 decades, they have gotten married, and raised families who were born here. Now a lot have grandchildren as well. You can change current immigration policies, but you cannot put the Genie back in the box. Biden should mimic Reagan, and do this last thing to Trump. Pardon all undocumented workers in the USA, and make them citizens.  But that would allow the businesses to get their employees, without the Republicans having to take responsibility for these people. And don’t forget, the Hispanic voting bloc gave Trump 42%. Let’s see how Trump policies pan out for them.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

If you are of a younger generation, I can’t blame you. Your only exposure to information now is a lot more controlled than it ever was before, prior to social media. Do journalists have journalistic integrity these days? It’s hard to say which ones do and don’t, but indoctrination? I’m afraid that’s not the case. I didn’t like Kamala Harris as a candidate, I had to vote for her because Trump is so out of line with my values which I forged through life experience.

The industrial revolution and guilded age was also hammered in class and the state has many strong unions. 

I was also blessed to be able to take class field trips to places like Chinatown in SF and tours of missions and history museums.

Many young people are actively seeking out historical knowledge, and in fact, the internet provides a wealth of resources, some of which were unavailable in previous decades. The access to diverse viewpoints—while overwhelming at times—also enables critical thinking and an understanding of history from multiple angles. Suggesting that younger people are somehow more “indoctrinated” is a bit of a blanket generalization, especially when the very platforms that enable discourse and awareness also enable misinformation.

As for your argument about the comparison between Trump’s rhetoric and fascism, it’s crucial to be very careful with these labels. While it's valid to critique Trump’s behavior and policies, calling him a fascist based on his rhetoric alone without considering the broader context risks oversimplification. Fascism is a specific historical phenomenon with a set of traits—authoritarian governance, suppression of opposition, extreme nationalism, and state control over many aspects of life—that, while concerning, doesn’t neatly map onto the U.S. political reality, even in Trump’s case. History is complex, and we should be careful not to use terms like “fascism” lightly, as they carry heavy historical weight and can undermine meaningful discourse when misapplied.

Your statement about journalistic integrity is valid in some ways, as the rise of sensationalism and biased reporting is a legitimate concern across media outlets. But that doesn’t mean all journalism is inherently compromised. There are still many journalists who hold themselves to high ethical standards, and dismissing all of modern media as ""indoctrinated"" doesn't do justice to the broader range of journalistic work being done today. Journalism, just like politics, exists on a spectrum, and it's worth acknowledging the diversity of thought and the ongoing struggle for objectivity.

Lastly, I think it's worth emphasizing that voting against a candidate like Trump does not automatically equate to being ""indoctrinated."" It’s possible to make a decision based on personal values, principles, and a careful consideration of the potential consequences of his leadership. It seems like you’re framing the situation as if those who disagree with you are simply following a media narrative, but I would argue that many people vote for reasons grounded in their own personal and moral beliefs, rather than being swayed by any particular ideological “groupthink.” Everyone is shaped by their experiences, and ultimately, the choice to vote for a candidate, whether it's Biden, Harris, or anyone else, is a deeply personal one based on a host of factors. 

The heart of the matter is this: We might not agree on everything, but let's recognize that thoughtful, informed individuals can arrive at different conclusions based on their own interpretations of history, values, and the world around them.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"In the interest of brevity I didn’t tell the whole story, we actually first moved to French-speaking Switzerland for my postdoc.

Now, after a bit over 3 years of learning, I am a decently competent French speaker. And I started learning at 27. It can be done, but it requires a lot of work. You won’t learn by osmosis and working exclusively in English.

"I think a big problem is that US elections are bizarre and a huge segment of the population doesn't seem to understand how their government works.

The election centers around the potential President, who goes around giving speeches and making numerous promises, while completely ignoring that they don't actually have the power to make most of that happen on their own. This is because the US President is merely the head of one of the 3 branches of US government, and needs to navigate dealing with Congress, the Senate and possibly the Supreme Court, besides there being a period mid-term where there's suddenly another turn of elections.

Add that the system has a bizarre propensity for being either near 50-50 or have different branches controlled by political enemies, and various fun things like the filibuster and debt ceiling and you get one mess of a political system where it can be impossible to do what you promised.

There seems to be a lack of awareness of how much it matters not only who wins, but by how much and who exactly are the sitting members of the elected government, since even if they're on the same team they might not actually agree with the President's agenda.

And I've got the depressing feeling that I, being a random non-American living on another continent understand this better than a lot of the natives.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

The truth is the very wealthy have been fucking the vast majority of U.S. citizens for decades.

Also, most of the good things Democrats want to do will require landslide victories that do in a sense give a President temporary dictatorial powers or supermajority control of Congress.

"It's the economy, stupid. That's why Democrats/Harris lost (and Biden not dropping out farther in advance). For all the macro econ numbers that look good, people's underlying wallets do not look good for working class Americans, and we have the same structural issues with the economy today that we've had for decades. In that scenario, incumbents can lose. Trump may be completely a charlatan, horrible in many ways, and un-serious about addressing these issues, but his rhetoric is populist economically. The messaging is key. His populist rhetoric cuts through, and the Democrats have a lack of messaging/outreach that can match.

For instance, think back to 2022 when inflation was raging. If Trump were president, he would have been shouting 24/7 scapegoating corporations, greedy boards/ceos, and throwing everyone and anyone elitist under the bus he could. Biden on the other hand was tone deaf and blase; almost completely absent in general (and aside from just the messaging/narratives, he should have actually done something with emergency COVID powers to rein in price gouging, even if courts tried to stop him).

They need to simplify the message and platform, and get big and bold. The power of three. should promote these three exclusively as their party platform going forward:

\- ""We're going to raise taxes on the wealthy and specifically dedicate those funds solely to maintaining and expanding Social Security and Medicare, and nothing else""

\- ""The era of the government and our party catering to Corporations and Wall St is over. We will rein in Corporate and Wall St dominance of our government and give a voice to working Americans and small business.""

It’s always easy to make fun of being “coastal elites” because Democrats are super nice and don’t hit back. A message of “Yeah. The Democrats made me a coastal elite and the Republicans made you broke” would be way more effective.

Just absurd. First-off, no one associates democracy with any of that. Secondly, the forces on the Right are the ones that fundamentally sow mistrust in institutions, in international law, in free trade, in free markets. They benefit the most by doing so because their argument is that the government has too much power, and will always tend towards control and corruption. That's the message THEY sell, that people should mistrust the INSTITUTIONS that are foundational for democracy and governance.  

Your argument can't seriously be that ""sure those institutions are corrupt, but the new ones we make will be...muah!"". You will lose that battle every single time, because I have no reason to trust you over anyone else advocating for stronger institutions/governance, especially when you start out telling me that said institutions are broken.

Many of your observations stem from the systemic preservation of chattel slavery. It's why the Electoral College elects presidents rather than a simple popular vote—you can award delegates based on state population, which lets you simultaneously disenfranchise parts of the population without reducing the influence those states would have. Congress has additional obstacles for passing legislation in order to protect slavery.

I think you are flirting with the edges, but you aren't quite getting it.

Here is the truth (and it will be a hard pill to swallow).:  the Republican party messaging is aspirational and is created for people with agency.  It is built around saying that the policies of the ""powerful"" are stopping you from getting what you want and/or deserve and we can change those policies and allow you to fend for yourself.  ""Illegal immigration hurts wages and opportunity for natives"".  ""Soft on crime policies make you less safe; the second amendment allows you to protect yourself.""  ""Hurt your ability to compete""  ""No school choice/vouchers stop you from doing the best for your kids' education"".  ""High taxes hurt your ability to provide for your family"".

Democratic party messaging is fatalistic, and created for people that don't feel in control of themselves and think someone else should help provide for them.  ""You need a union to protect you"".  ""You need a higher minimum wage or else no one will pay you what you are worth"".  ""Big corporations are price gouging and you need us to stop them"".  Seriously, go read r/antiwork sometime.  Full of serfs expecting their feudal lords at their menial jobs to change the rules to benefit them.

I'm not interested in getting into a debate on the validity of the messaging or whether the demographic is interpreting the situation correctly.  That's missing the point.  If the Democratic party doesn't understand this (and they won't because they are too in love with the smell of their own farts and the line that people are just racist and sexist), then we can look forward to President JD Vance in 2029.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

This is literally the worst level of government to create a national party that actually wants to govern.

People pushing third parties are not geniuses thinking up revolutionary new ideas. It's been routinely discussed since the founding of America. 

No serious third party has emerged since the Whigs in the 1800s.

And in 2020 when he started to gain momentum and it looked like he might start getting a lead in the primary, all the other corporate Dems dropped out to endorse Biden, which obviously has a massive effect on the electorate. 

It is silly to talk about ""the voters"" as a large block having responsibility. Obviously they collectively decide the outcome, but leadership, media, candidates, all shape how they will decide.

Before you say (in general, not you specifically), that was just moderates coalescing their vote, read the polls. Klobuchar and Buttigieg 2nd choice were split pretty evenly between Sanders and Biden, because again voters don't vote based on ideology. However , those endorsements ensured that most of them broke for Biden. 

And before you say, good job on Biden for playing politics and getting those alliances. Firstly, Biden did nothing..Obama pulled the strings for him. Secondly, read manufacturing consent.

Who has advocated the most for equality with the Asian community in regards to things like affirmative action disproportionately impacting the Asian community? Punished for being smarter on average.

Trump will increase prices with tariffs, sanction Ukraine, and the money spent to Ukraine will go to line up the pockets of the wealthy as historically done.

“And as I say, Kamala may have, I think she would have done well in that and been stronger going forward. But we don’t know that. That didn’t happen. We live with what happened. And because the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately, that really made it almost impossible to have a primary at that time.”

No, ms. Pelosi, Bernie is right, that message was coming from the fanatics (christo fascists, regular fascists, and full on nazis such as the proud boys), you will never...

"1) Biden should have stood by his commitment to only stay in for one term.  

2) He should have decided not to run again by December 2023 at the latest to give other candidates room.  Biden deliberately sucked the oxygen out of the room for other candidates to fully get off the ground in time.

3) I do think Harris did the best she could in 15 weeks (!!!).  She consciously tried to avoid many of Hillary's mistakes.  But she was running a campaign for a vastly different country - it was like the Betamax of presidential campaigns, better on the technology but losing in the marketplace.  

4) Pelosi's comments about Bernie Sanders put us all on notice that the Democratic leadership don't intend to change a damn thing.  They'd rather lose to a fascist than win with a socialist.  

5) All of this seems kind of moot - if Trump does what he says and starts going after people, and at the very least rigging the electoral process like in his model Hungary and other countries, then the Democrats can rerun Hillary's campaign forever and they will never actually get anywhere.  It won't matter, because getting too mouthy will get them blacklisted, debanked, thrown in prison, or maybe thrown out a 30-story window just to make a point.  

I am not at all hyperbolic here - Trump openly admires autocrats, the nation knows it, and elected him anyways.  To pretend like this is all some sort of game is literally deadly.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"That's part of the problem, sure. But not having a valid platform to address the basic needs of the working class who are struggling to feed their families is the real issue. Republicans really hammered home their desire to help those folks while Democrats didn't really address it. People who can't pay rent don't need a housing stipend for a mortgage they can't afford. Raising minimum wage is great, in theory, but it will take years for other wages to adjust. Most of those people struggling aren't making minimum wage. People who are making minimum wage can't afford to struggle. Republicans offered a way to fix it NOW, and that's what people need. Sure, those tariffs are a poor way to do it, but it's *something* and the Democrats didn't have anything that could bring immediate relief.

Biden's declining mental acuity was evident by 2022 in media recordings alone, and I find it hard to believe it wasn't more evident behind closed doors.

Also, Biden’s endorsement wasn’t the *only* reason no one else threw their hat in the ring, even if it was a major one.

"Personal opinion on what brought on this loss, in order of most to least. 

1. People's home finances. Yes, the overall economy is healthier (gdp, stock). Life necessities for households on the lower end of the spectrum, not so much. Too much of let them eat cake in the way her plan was presented. Totally understand it's not what she actually said, but it was extremely easy to interpret it to that.

2. She could not distance herself from Biden.  And while she may have been an active VP, it did not show. All the way back to the 90s, we heard about Gore visiting schools (and misspelling potato). We heard about Cheney and his hunting incident (let's not ever do that again). We often saw Biden interacting with Obama. We heard more than enough out of Pence about morals and dating and good grief go away. Kamala did not have the same presence. 

3. While she had well written plans that could have been executed with at least some success, she did not do well getting this across when she spoke in public. This goes back to not being able to fully separate from Biden. 

4. The second attempt by the DNC to force a  female candidate backfired. There are many women in the party who could win a primary, but they aren't being granted that chance because leadership wants a specific ideal. She did not do well in the primary she participated in and the DNC ignored that.

5. And the final major, though the smallest major as a catalyst, the misogyny and racism. Yes they caused the loss of at least a portion. They were not the main reason, but they certainly are one of many reasons. 

There are many smaller reasons I probably just don't think about. But this is my perspective as someone who has not voted for the orange in any of the 3 he's been in.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Elon spent 85 BILLION dollars to buy one of the biggest media companies in the world for the sole purpose of turning it into a rightwing propaganda empire.

"Depends on the video you’re talking about.

Let’s back up, going back to 2020 Trump and Russia pushed a lot of narrative that Biden was old and mentally broken. But if you watch 2020 speeches it really doesn’t show. Biden’s very coherent and articulate. He dog walks Trump in every debate. 

Through the presidency this narrative never went away but early in a lot of it was fabricated like it was in 2020. Two that come to mind were a video of him walking off into a corn field but the video was cropped and in the full version you can see he’s going to talk to someone. Or the Russia hostage release where Biden gets on the plane. Right wing said no one was up there and he just wandered on up. In reality he was going to speak to the pilots and DOD staff on board.

The point is Biden’s age and mental acuity has been a target all his term and up until 2024 I don’t think people knew his appearance had gotten worse. Probably because the general public wasn’t paying attention. But also because Biden did drastically cut down his public appearances that weren’t planned or scripted.

To be clear, I believe Biden is still smarter than me or anyone in this sub. I just think he is old and slurs his words more. Brain runs faster than his mouth can and it gets jumbled. But I have no issue with him having the nuclear codes still and would proudly have voted for him again if he was on the ticket.

But optically he was cooked. Done. You can’t sell a presidency if your main marketer can’t speak clearly. So after the debate all of that prep Republicans had been laying down since 2020 came up full force and people panicked. Correctly I might add.

But the real question is how the fuck did Pelosi, Schumer, his former press secretary Psaki, or anyone else with direct access to Biden not notice this or bring it up. Biden didn’t magically get old in June 2024, so where the fuck were you Pelosi?

">Look at Biden. He was so impaired he literally had to drop out of the race because everyone publicly could finally see how deteriorated he was (after the Democratic elites/insiders told us he was perfectly fine).

And waited til after he ""won"" the primary to drop out so voters didn't even get to choose their candidate.

The calls for Biden to drop out of the race included Kamala too. She was never going to beat Trump. 

Dems refused to listen to their base and as a result got swept up in a red wave. 

I wonder, can the party even survive this?",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"This is in Wisconsin, which used to have a GOP gerrymander that basically guaranteed that Republicans would win every single state legislative election. However, after Janet Protasiewicz won a Wisconsin Supreme Court election in 2023 and flipped the state Supreme Court from a conservative to a liberal majority, the Supreme Court overturned the gerrymandered maps, and the state enacted new fair maps that undid over a decade of GOP gerrymandering. This is the result of that: Democrats were able to flip 10 seats in the state Assembly and 4 seats in the state Senate. It's incredible to see what happens we have fair elections that don't have pre-determined outcomes due to gerrymandering.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Oligarchs in general.

They have purchased mainstream news outlets and quieted their voices.  

The Russians call this ""political technology"" (thanks Heather Cox Richardson), and it's one of the ways they create and sustain a dictatorship in Russia and in Hungary. 

Originally, the right-wing infosphere was started to create an environment where Richard Nixon wouldn't have had to resign.  It clearly worked, since Trump committed crimes that Richard Nixon would have fucking dreamed of doing.  But now, it's creating a climate where America can slide into fascism.  

Bad information leads to bad decisions.  And the oligarchs and the right wing are making sure that the majority of Americans see only bad information.

Edit:  We also learned that actual news is not profitable, so lots of outlets prioritized money over good information.  FoxNews isn't profitable because it gives good information - it's profitable because it tells people want they want to hear.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Additionally, they own his VP, JD Vance. Vance is completely under the control of these men. He worked for Peter Thiel, who has been his primary supporter since he began his political career. Thiel even invested $15 million to help him secure a seat in the Senate. This group is made up of Silicon Valley billionaires with connections to South Africa, either as natives (like Musk and Sacks) or having been raised in South Africa and Namibia (like Thiel). The problem with a group of foreign-born oligarchs is that they do not align with the interests of Americans. These individuals will consistently prioritize their business and personal interests above all else.

Musk would never want to confront china or russia because he aims to sell them cars and gain access to rare earth materials. Southafrica is a member of BRICS and has an affinity for corrupt authoritarian regimes like russia and china. Trump unlawfully stored classified documents at his residence and maintained covert communication with Putin over the years, a practice also shared by Elon Musk. Why do these pro-russian figures continue to engage with the leader of an enemy nation??????",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"Yea Republicans have a full on ecosystem that just doesn’t exist on the left.  A lot of it loops back in and integrates with their media and propaganda outlets.  From TV to Radio and now finally a sizable portion of social media, with billionaires enabling every facet.

The harsh truth at the center of this is, we pissed off the wealthy and lost a lot of support there going too hard on fair taxation.  And the wealthy ultimately hold true power in our plutocracy since at least Reagan.  If we can swallow that bitter pill, the way to defeat Republicans is to offer the wealthy a better deal.  We lose on the tax front, we lose on the regulatory front…but may be able to establish enough of a foothold to get other ideas through and more leverage overall. 

The alternative to that, is figuring out how to reverse what Reagan set in motion without the support of the wealthy.  And do so in a way that nearly all non Republicans are on board.  We essentially have to put Republicans in a state of paradox that actually affects support within their base. We need good strategists to get there. And funding for making sure the messaging is hammered and unavoidable.  We cannot get the Dem vote through fear alone, we’re just not wired that way. I don’t know, ideas?",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"I absolutely cannot agree with your first solution. Too much to lose. 

At the end of the day, there are almost infinitely more poor people than billionaires. Money doesn't buy elections as Harris just found out. We need a Democratic party that is willing to fully cut ties with the ultra-wealthy. Pretending there are some good billionaires out like they do with Mark Cuban is sending the wrong message. We had the CEO of American Express at the DNC. No good in my view. Actually bring in that portion of the population that doesn't participate because let's be honest neither party really helps them.

So for me, it is doing a good thing in a bad way, and we should strive in the future to do good things in a good way perhaps by making rules about when appointments can be made or that appointments must be brought to vote. 
I don’t know that it specifically undermine the will of the people. The people had elected 51 senators to make a Republican majority and those 51 collectively elected McConnell as their leader. It was an intense concentration of power into a human who is well let’s just say not my favorite currently either and certainly not flawless. But was given the power to make those decisions and did so.

How come you give a ""fair"" pass to unexpected procedure within rules, but expected procedure within rules is ""not good""? 

It sort of sounds like by what you're saying, lame duck is ""not good"", but what McConnell did should be worse in your mind. He did the not good and then some. I can agree lame duck nominations can be less representative, but breaking precedent to change that only when politically convenient is, in my mind, worse. 

There has to be a middle that isn't just in the back pocket for one party.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"From article



The initial election results in Michigan's Calhoun County didn't include all of the votes cast there, and officials were working Friday to resolve the discrepancy, according to the Secretary of State's office.

Calhoun County is located in southern Michigan and featured a competitive state House race between Rep. Jim Haadsma, D-Battle Creek, and Republican Steve Frisbie, a Calhoun County commissioner. The reporting problem centered on absentee ballots that were submitted in the city of Battle Creek, said Angela Benander, spokeswoman for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.

The city used two high speed absentee ballot tabulators but the election management system in the county wasn't programmed to combine the drives from the two tabulators. So after reading the first set of numbers, it replaced the first results with the second set instead of adding them together, Benander said.

""So the reported results were missing a lot of votes,"" Benander told The Detroit News on Friday.

... 




Benander said the numbers were in the process of being corrected.

It was unclear how many votes might been impacted by the reporting discrepancy. In the current unofficial numbers, Frisbie was beating Haadsma by 1,381 votes, 19,233-17,852. The Associated Press declared Frisbie the winner on Wednesday.

Benander said the Secretary of State's office doesn't expect the added votes to swing the 44th House District race to Haadsma, but they would make the outcome closer. Democrats lost control of the 110-seat state House in Tuesday's election, and Republicans have counted Frisbie in their new 58-seat majority.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

First, unequivocal unwavering support for all marginalized Americans is a core principle of the party. This will never change. It goes without saying that this, absolutely, includes support for all LGTBQ Americans. Defending them and easing the struggles they face. 

But second, the party has to find ways to not be completely subsumed by a demographic that represents 1% of the population. 

Do we fight for them? Absolutely. But we also fight for demographics that make up 15% of the population. 30% of the population. 53% of the population. The entire population. Etc. etc.

The Republican Party succeeded in forcing the Democrats to talk about the transgender issue to the exclusion of many many other issues. Issues that could have won the election. 

Democrats have to learn not to take that bait. 

The bait of “do you defend this trans issue?” “Do you defend this development in the trans community?” “Do you defend this age group getting top or bottom surgery?” “Do you defend public funds being used for these surgeries? Do you defend public funds being used for these surgeries for prison inmates?” 

And on and on.

Yes you have to defend the trans community always always. 

But no you don’t have to take the Republican tactical bait and let it become something you are always always talking about.

There’s only so many hours in the day. The attention span that many voters will be giving you is very very short.

If all you gave them when you had their attention was discussions about trans issues… there’s a solid chance they are looking at you as out of touch with their lives and tuning you out.

They, or a loved one, may need life saving surgeries too. They may not have the health care they need to make that happen. The money they need to make that happen. They might feel oppressed/depressed too. They might be very poor and look at this entire debate as rich-people problems that they can’t even begin to relate to. 

They might be looking for someone to defend them too. 

The Party needs to make sure they aren’t getting stuck in a rut, and failing to represent broader swaths of the electorate in their public discussions and messaging. 

I think the Republicans succeeded in making the Democratic Party look like a party that is hyper focused on this issue, to the exclusion of much larger voting blocs who also feel they need support. 

It’s all bogus and propaganda… but politics is a contact sport. There’s no referee calling fouls. 

And the Democratic Party has to learn to body these tactics off of themselves and drive their own, broader, message.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

"I hear this framing a lot, but what resources are dems actually spending talking about trans people? Only 2 that I know of actually focused on trans issues in their campaign, Allred and Brown ran ads *against* trans women in sports, and they both lost. The republicans are the ones who spent $20 million+ on transphobic advertising to convince the American people that Dems are too focused on trans issues. 

And while I think it’s stupid, as a trans person, to vote for anyone but Democrats…they’ve consistently fallen short in protecting us and I definitely feel the disillusionment that led your friend to vote for someone else. But to me that’s more a symptom of the broader issue with American electoral politics nowadays, which is really that the majority of Americans are misinformed and ignorant. Most people aren’t paying attention beyond the big social media talking points, so they’re vulnerable to manipulation by foreign powers, corporate media, and the similarly misinformed views of the people around them. 

People also aren’t really talking about voter suppression as a contributing factor to Republican victories, but it’s been a consistent strategy of conservatives in America since Black people got the right to vote. They know very well that Democrats lose when turnout is low. Election Day still isn’t a holiday. Red and purple states alike purged their voter rolls several times this year, targeting voters who are more likely to vote Dem. Some states even allow citizens to report registered voters to try to get them kicked off the rolls! How many people got turned away at the polls and didn’t know they could get a provisional ballot? And how many mail-in ballots were lost or delayed USPS was defunded and DeJoy is still postmaster general? 

My point is that it really isn’t so simple as Democrats needing better messaging. They needed better strategy to figure out how to get people to turn out despite all the barriers to voting. Messaging should have been part of that, but they also needed much stronger grassroots efforts to get voters registered and informed. I don’t think they understood how much of an uphill battle they were fighting, which is extremely frustrating considering how 2016 went.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

But I do believe that the party has become somewhat subsumed by the issue in this last election cycle and that, to me at least, the discussions I observe from progressives on this issue strike me as problematic. 

Whether the notion originated from within the party or without, if you asked many Americans to list what the D party’s main concerns were. What they were politically focused on. I imagine many respondents would struggle to come up with any other issue other than this issue.

Within the leftist spaces themselves, here on Reddit for example, this issue tends to dominate the feeds. To me, a leftist, it feels like it’s been a constant barrage. 

Which could be ok, in theory, I whole heartedly support trans rights… but if you enter any of these threads and observe those discussions, what you see is leftist people being amazingly nasty. You see brigading. You see people ganging up on a person.  Smearing that person as human garbage. 

And most of the times the recipient of all of this is a died-in-the-wool progressive… who’s voted D their entire voting lives.

"Yeah I have no science behind any of this. These are just my own observations…

But now that we’ve got social media and that’s how many of us meet and talk to each other… it strikes me that even how we talk about these things amongst ourselves (ignoring how the party establishment wants to talk about these things)… is having an effect here. 

I think it’s part of the stew that caused 15 million of our own voters to stop caring/stop supporting us. That number is - insanely - striking… given who the opponent was this election. This was not John McCain, where you can kinda stay home cause he’s a good and decent guy too…

So something really huge is going on and I’m trying to figure it out. 

What I can say is that when I joined the party a quarter century ago… as a young heterosexual male… I felt completely welcomed. I never felt judged. I never felt like I had to be “X” level of progressive. 

Identity politics wasn’t a thing we talked about. We talked about wealth disparity, losing our manufacturing, corporations exploiting foreign labor markets and leaving our working class decimated. We talked about policy that would make companies offshoring their labor and manufacturing pay for doing so. Taking that money and investing it into our own labor force. We talked about tax relief for the lower and middle classes. We talked about how we needed to lower the estate tax thresholds. We talked about private student loans being predatory… blah blah blah. You get my point.

No one ever put me on the spot and said “how do you feel about (insert socially polarizing issue here)… “ and if I wasn’t rabid about it then I was smeared as (insert insult here). 

And had that happened??? I’m not sure I ever would have joined the party! I suspect I would have… but I would have resented it quite a bit. 

As I said, I am just thinking out loud trying to figure out why we are turning off our own voters and getting swept in every. single. swing state….

And I suspect this is a pretty big part of that problem. At least with a number of demographics that ended us on Tuesday. (Gen Z males, Latino males, African American males, Caucasian males… and basically every heterosexual male subgroup that can possibly exist).",2024_11_09,05_18_26

And the whole, “Oh your poor masculinity!!” dismissiveness if anyone says anything ***AT ALL*** that doesn’t just endorse and accept any and all trans stances, when it’s like 1% of the population but 90% of the conversation, is more than off putting to people. 

And it was, in fact, a piece of what lost us middle class votes from regular people and minorities. 

How many trans Mexican and black kids do you see?

And now their parents and many of them voted for someone who blatantly and openly wants to fuck them over. 

Those people aren’t stupid. They’re just not fully sexually liberalized white kids with the privilege to feel oppressed over minor concerns in this new environment where being anything but straight is required. 

They’re just scared, annoyed, and tired of being talked down to for just being normal people.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

They won’t reply to this gem of a reply,2024_11_09,05_18_26
"If I looked up the medical consensus on both puberty blockers for children and conversion therapy, what am I going to discover? It’s easy to find single-sources of evidence that support or condemn nearly any medical treatment, which is why they have organizations of professionals to agree on these things. 

Furthermore, while children cannot legally give consent to medical procedures, they can absolutely be consulted. If a parent, child and doctor agree on a course of healthcare performed by a certified and regulated medical practitioner, I am not going to stand in the way, regardless of my personal opinion as to that healthcare. 

However, you’re as unlikely to find conversion therapy that falls within that rubric as you are to find puberty blockers for children that falls outside of it. Furthermore, puberty blockers for children were developed and used as a medical treatment well before any use in gender-affirming care. Can the same be said for conversion therapy? No.",2024_11_09,05_18_26

Illegal crossings have been dropping consistently since the initial spike that happened when Biden took office. That spike that happened when he took office was in part because Republicans kept lying, and continue to lie, that the borders are ""open"" under Democrats, so a huge wave of border-crossers waited until Biden took office to make the trip.
