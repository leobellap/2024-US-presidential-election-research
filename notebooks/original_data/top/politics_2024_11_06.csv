I think that most of the people who genuinely believe that the world laughs at us when a Democrat is President have never traveled outside of the US and actually *experienced* anything outside of their own local bubble/culture, and have no real sense of the wider world and just *how much* better many civilized countries are in so many ways, as compared to the US. And I'm not being ""elitist"" here -- a person can travel in Europe on not much money, by backpacking, staying in youth hostels, etc. (that's what I did). (This may be true of Asia, Australia, and other areas as well, but I have no direct experience there.)


Some of them *really* don't understand that the entire world, aside from the other fascists/dictators, is *aghast* that we allowed trump into office the first time, much less that he is the Republican candidate now. Mostly they laugh at him, but they also know how stupid, demented, and fascist he is, and the untold damage he could inflict in the US and on the rest of the world. This is not only a US issue, it is a *planet-affecting* matter.


When a Democrat is in office, the US is afforded respect -- especially in the case of Obama, a highly intelligent, compassionate, well-spoken President. That we went from Obama to trump is a national shame, a national disgrace. We *will not* do it again.

Even if both sides ""are in the pockets of billionaires"", only one has staffed the FTC with people like Lina Khan, have pushed for regulations on corporations, have pushed for higher minimum wage, meanwhile the other side is pushing for deregulation and tax cuts and now tariffs(? seriously?) and that's only touching on a tiny layer of the economic aspect.

I regret that vote.  It wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference to the election since I was in a red state, but it would have served as a referendum by adding another vote to the popular count that Gore won by.

Afterwards, the GOP fought against the legally mandatory recount and conducted riots. They selected counties where they found the recount would benefit Gore, and fought the recount there.

He can‚Äôt just not include polls in the result, or they‚Äôd be guilty of the same manipulation as the pollsters.

"I also fell through the cracks at my small high school, my history teacher wanted to speed rush all of American history just so we could spend an entire semester covering Vietnam, which his father fought in, so he could bring in his dad to frighten us all with some gruesome horror stories.

I have a job which occasionally has me doing very repetitive tasks for a day or two a week, sometimes more, and so I like to listen to stuff.  The problem is that free resources like podcasts are very poorly sourced (like ultra popular Dan Carlin) or just really dry to listen to, but they got me hooked on wanting better history content. 

The best bang for my buck has been a Wondrium/Great Courses (for some reason they keep going back and forth on those names) subscription, you get history courses taught by actual professors, not just hobbyists like Carlin, and you can either watch the courses or just listen to them.  I‚Äôve found the history ones are easy to just listen to, although sometimes I‚Äôll switch to video on my phone to see a map or painting or what have you.  

The primary American history course on there is very extensive and exhaustive.  There are three main history lecturers on that one, the first of whom I enjoyed very immensely who covered from colonial America on through 1850 or so with a strong focus on American civics through that time.  I learned a lot about those presidents, some Supreme Court justices through that time, even prominent Speakers of the House, Senate majority leaders, etc.

The next lecturer covered basically from Buchanan (President just before Lincoln) on through the end of Reconstruction (1877 compromise I referenced above), and I liked him a lot but it was obviously very battle focused and the guy‚Äôs style was a bit jarring to me relative to the previous lecturer.  

I liked the last lecturer least of all, not that he was bad, it just really didn‚Äôt fit the rest of the lecture course narrative. He basically skipped over all presidents from 1877 on through Teddy, citing they were all mostly terrible presidents who aren‚Äôt worth paying attention to (and I was like that‚Äôs WHY I want to learn more about them! lol), but it was still some valuable big picture stuff where I learned a lot.  

That final lecturer did leave off with a very chilling note though, basically he mentioned that as a British person, he found the peaceful transition of power amongst administrations one of the best things about all of American history.  I had chills up my spine listening to that and being worried about what Trump was going to do should he lose.  For that reason alone (200+ years of peaceful power transitions, the hallmark of American democracy going back to Jefferson/Adams just cast aside by Trump), Donald J Trump is the worst president in history, in my opinion.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

So I became a weekly listener (like you, I skipped most MMA stuff, also I could never stomach Joey Diaz) and while I fell off a bit as I got older, I was still tuning in for pretty much any guest I was mildly interested in. 

But around the 2016 election he started getting weird about Hillary. I was hearing the exact thing you‚Äôre describing, he‚Äôd discuss criticisms of Hillary extensively and just ignore any counterpoints, or hypocrisy from the right.

"Right wing voters live in a bubble of ""alternate facts"" and call real news ""fake news"".


There's studies where they test people's knowledge of current events and right wing Americans know less than people who literally don't watch or read any news.


Their bubble doesn't show Trump doing anything dumb, but DORS intentionally accuse his opponent of the exact weaknesses Trump has (it's a common manipulation tactic for propaganda).


This means that their brainwashing almost guarantees that anything that sounds bad must be Trump's opponent.


Democrats, on the other hand, follow actual news, which is easy because actual news is agreed upon in every newspaper, magazine, TV channel etc around the world. You can read an article from Japan, the U.S., UK, Australia, South Korea, etc and they'll agree on reality (with some exceptions if it is Murdoch owned, but even many of Newscorps properties report actual news like the WSJ or Marketwatch).

The thing that no-one pointed out was that on the graphs, yes most people had biases that interrupted their ability to see what the number was saying(in the vacumn of that fake study made up for the experiment, the participants knew it was fake), but higher intelligence people still did better than lower intelligent people, and that when you look on the graph, I'm 80%sure it had dem leaning participants had a 10-15% more people getting it right across the board in all possible study combos.¬†


It was one of those things where a lot of the lines looked similar enough, but if you paused the video and actually look the scale of the chart your realize thatvit was actually a dang big difference.¬†

He is not a full blown MAGA, but he is a party-over-country Republican who has flip flopped his views based on whatever the talking point of the party becomes.

Elon and Trump form the Adeptus Idioticus a bit earlier than the Warhammer timeline?,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"The irony about Mars, and all of Elon's fanboys thinking in their lifetimes they might be able to go live on some Martian colony (while having Elon's chips in their brains, despite many being anti-vax, lol) is that it'd be a nightmare:

Literally every movie, even the more critically acclaimed, ""The Martian"" (with Matt Damon) don't depict the fact that Mars only has *a bit under 1/3rd of Earth's gravity*, so in all those movies, people should be doing the goofy bouncy walking more similar to the astronauts we had on the Moon (but a little less extreme).

On top of that: radiation levels on the surface are *over a thousand times that on Earth*, and without terraforming the entire thing, which we're centuries, if not millenia away from technologically.

Finally: the temperature owing to its at most very thin atmosphere, is *at best* 70 degrees F during the day time at the equator, which while impressive it gets that warm, that far from the sun, *it drops down to -100+ F at night,* like a very extreme Earth desert, and it only gets worse the further from the equator you get.

So yeah, I don't doubt we might have a permanent small observatory, or a few, decades from now on Mars, similar to Antarctica now - but unless people would want to live years deep underground without natural light, bouncing around in low gravity, risking atrophy, etc., where low gravity likely makes human pregnancies impossible: living on Mars would be a total nightmare, lol.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Merchan didn't do that though. However he rationalizes it, he lent Trump a hand by repeatedly delaying his sentencing. The delays in sentencing were 100% political and work to Trump's benefit.

I agree with Judge Chutkan that the only way to treat Trump without being political is to treat him exactly the same as any other defendant would be treated. If Merchan had done that, Trump would have already been sentenced--though not necessarily to jail.

A typical white-collar defendant in a case like Trump's--old, no criminal record--would be likely to receive probation in NY. Trump himself is more of a wild card, because of all the crimes he's obviously committed, yet hasn't been proven guilty of in court. But by the same token, a typical defendant in Trump's situation would not be entitled to multiple adjournments of his sentencing. Maybe one, due to the appellate issue created by the US Supreme Court this past summer. But he should have been sentenced long ago despite that.

All that being said...if Merchan delayed his sentencing in order to watch how he conducts himself while free during the election...he may end up with a much more solid foundation to sentence Trump to prison. Merchan hasn't made any sort of promise, and can give Trump the max if he determines that Trump deserves it.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"I suspect what we're seeing most of all is the mass-gamification of polling, forecasts, and betting markets.

Prior to 2008, polls and forecasts weren't a part of the popular consciousness. They were for political wonks and nerds and a handful of journalists.

Then ol' Nate Silver comes 'round and grabs a pot and dumps some polls and some statistics in to it and sprinkles in some pretty graphs for flavor and it *takes off*, because internet nerds have some pretty clickies to browse all day long in the lead-up to the election and reading the stuff he puts together makes them feel smart.

2012 is still mostly Nate Silver's game but now randos are starting to talk about it too and big publications like New York TImes wants a piece of the action.

By 2016, there are now multiple competitors and forecasts have become *part of the political process*. 2016 does 2016 things of course and a few dozen bloggers get a tidal wave of clicks by writing up ""what went wrong in 2016"" articles, but the one thing that *doesn't* happen is people stop following polls and forecasts. A few nerds, like me, have the massively unpopular opinion that, maybe, these forecasts are actually a bit harmful to the political process, but the slobbering masses are too desperate to know what's gonna happen before it happens to hear it.

By 2020, polls, forecasts, and betting markets have become fully gamified, and now in 2024 we're experiencing it like people are suddenly experiencing climate change for the first time. Everyone's confused, everyone's like, ""wait, why is this all so weird this year?"".

In like 80% of discussions about the US presidential election over the last three months especially you'll find *someone* saying something along the lines of, ""welp, guess I better make a wager over on (a betting market)"". People are discussing *the names and reputations of pollsters and forecasters now*, and *that* behavior is indistinguishable from everybody in suburbia buying an investment property in 2007.

Now we're cheering on individual polls like they're the same team sports as political races.

I don‚Äôt know how a subreddit handles that, but as an individual, I highly recommend subscribing to an outlet that you find consistently good (not perfect, none of them are perfect).",2024_11_06,05_05_54

I spent my first 6 months diving into the data to really get a handle of everything, ultimately making the case how there's a lot of correlation on topline metrics, but when you start digging in, the correlation doesn't hold up.

Everything I said was just dismissed. It was very frustrating. But I realized that the people in charge had about 30 years of inertia on their side and they weren't willing to stick their necks out to do something different. If we stopped doing things that they could historically take credit for being successful, and instead did other things that ended up not appearing successful, it would hurt their career. And if we ended up being more successful, but the explanation included no longer doing things that they historically touted as being successful, that would also portray them in a negative light.

""When I'm president, I will get *two* scoops of ice cream, and you will only get one!""

""When I'm president, if you say mean things to me I'll just say 'Get him out of here', and the police will come and drag you away!""

His words and ideas are a child's vision of power. This is by his own admission, in a way:

[quote]
>Donald Trump's temper-tantrum tactics have been explained by the man himself. The frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination admitted to his biographer that, ""When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I‚Äôm basically the same. The temperament is not that different.""

>Pulitzer-Prize winning reporter Michael D'Antonio, whose book, Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success, comes out in late September, nabbed the quotable gem during his six hours of interviews with the real estate king . . .

"In 2016, the New York Times published a very detailed precinct-by-precinct online map of the vote totals in NYC.

Most of it was very blue, as expected.  There were a few red pockets that didn't surprise me.  The vast majority of Staten Island went for Trump, which wasn't surprising because Staten Island has been a Republican stronghold for decades, for some convoluted set of reasons.  

Another unsurprisingly red chunk of the map was a neighborhood called Breezy Point, at the far western end of the Rockaway peninsula.  That neighborhood is literally a gated community on a private beach.  In NYC.  It's clearly the kind of absolutely insane wealth where people's main concern is ""When I die, I need to leave my yachts to my children, without them having to pay taxes on it.""  So, no surprise there either.

There were however 2 other little red pockets within the city that made me scratch my head, and dig deeper to figure out ""What's going on there?""

One pocket was Brighton Beach, just a little east of Coney Island.   I'd been Coney Island a handful of times.  I'd walked along the beach down to Brighton Beach from Coney Island.  That whole area always seemed like Mets-fan-working-class-NYC to me. It made no sense that Brighton Beach would be Republican.  But... I learned, that Brighton Beach is also known as ""Little Russia.""  Not the explanation I was expecting to find, but certainly a clear explanation, of why that neighborhood would break for Trump.

Another red area that surprised me was a neighborhood called Middle Village, smack dab in the middle of Queens.  I had no experience with this area, and thusly didn't have any preconceived notions of how / why it would vote this way or that.  After a bit of googling though, I found out that back in the 70s and 80s, when NYC was genuinely a rough place... when Times Square was more like a red light district, than Disneyland... back when crime (both petty and violent) was genuinely out of control... The one safe neighborhood in the whole city was Middle Village.  Why?   Cause that's where all mafia top brass lived.  Every two-bit mugger and car thief and tweaked out addict knew not to fuck with anyone in that neighborhood, because the mob would find you, and respond 10-fold.

So... that's who voted for Trump in NYC, in 2016.   Russians, and the mob.  (And Staten Island and the insanely wealthy of Breezy Point).  The rest of the city knows him as the shitty grifter that he is.

Edit: Some words and some grammar.

Edit 2:  Apparently I made some very wrong assumptions about the demographics of Breezy Point.  Turns out it's not a super wealthy neighborhood (despite being a gated community on a private beach).  Apologies.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"To hail as their own a man who, by all accounts, would have sneered at their toil in favor of glittering indulgence ‚Äì it is a betrayal of reason, of the very spirit that forged this republic.

This is exactly where racists think Black people should be, serving white people. To them, as long as it's clear that they, a white person, control the interaction and the Black person will do what they're told, the racist is generally cordial. 

To your actual point, it depends on how closeted their racism is. Where I grew up, there was a lot of racism, but it mostly happened outside of actual interactions with Black people. They'd bitch and moan about the Black person to their own family and friends, but in public they were civil. Some wouldn't acknowledge a Black person existed until circumstances called for it. Some wouldn't shake a Black person's hand or make any physical contact with them. If they had Black neighbors, they'd either eventually decide that they're some of the *good ones* or blame them for everything that goes wrong with their house/neighborhood and call the police on them for any minor thing. 

*Most* ^([citation needed]) racists I know just want Black people to stay *over there* and to *know their place* but it's never backed up with anything besides whining at home or with their friends. 

Since Trump has made it more socially acceptable to be racist in public, there's been a lot more overt racist things, like refusing to move out of the way on the sidewalk, spitting behind their backs, and generally loudly voicing complaints about ""those people"" when Black people are around. 

I haven't seen a resurgence of burning crosses or throwing bricks through windows, but if Trump ends up as president, I'd expect those events to follow.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"I want to share a story about Jon Tester, and part of the reason I've voted for him for over a decade.

When I got out of the Marines, I went to UM on the GI Bill.

The money didn't come for tuition/stipends etc. I was a young former E-4, newly married. We were barely covering expenses and borrowing money from family. I considered dropping out.

As late October approached, I was getting desperate. My wife was pregnant and we were scraping by. The VA was not helpful at all. I'd wait for 3-4 hours on hold just to be dropped or be told their hands were tied. The campus VA was sympathetic but couldn't do anything, either.

I ended up emailing all my local/state representatives and Senators.  One of them, the only one to respond, forwarded the message to Tester's office.

One day later, I was in Tester's Missoula office with *his chief of staff* in the closing days of an election year.

She took down all my info, thanked me for my service, and Tester had a congressional inquiry filed that afternoon.

That was a Friday--I had my money on Monday. 


This is just an anecdote, and it seems small, but this guy's team sat down with a random 22 year old kid in the heat of an election and solved my issue with compassion and quick action. Right through all the red tape.

I'll never forget that of all the people I asked for help, it was a local Democrat and Senator Tester's office *alone* who reached out and helped me.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

">It found Tester four percentage points ahead of Sheehy, according to Leuchtman, who did not release the full poll results (his firm does privately commissioned polling), just within the survey‚Äôs 4.97 percent margin of error.

Oh man, don't get my hopes up.  I've completely written Tester off. If he manages to pull this one out along with a Harris victory tonight, I'll concede that we're back in one of the better timelines after 8 years of dog shit.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Don‚Äôt forget we have also have abortion rights on the ballot to help push turnout in his favor. And anecdotally, the ground game for the Tester campaign has been blowing Sheehy‚Äôs out of the water and I‚Äôm in the reddest of the cities here. Road and yard signs and advertising I‚Äôve seen slightly more Tester than Sheehy. From talking to my very Republican family they‚Äôre not that enthusiastic about Sheehy or against Tester; it‚Äôs mostly come down to shrugs and ‚Äúwell, Sheehy has an R next to his name so I guess I‚Äôll pick him.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt think Tester winning is a certainty but I have  hope he can pull it off. He‚Äôs never had an easy race or comfortable polling.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

People are severely underestimating how much of a bad move killing Roe V Wade was, this isn't something 51% of the population is going to take lying down, and by God, if the American people have any fight left in us at all, the right will feel the sting of this until there are constitutional amendments to protect it.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

It makes no goddamn sense whatsoever. First of all, why would they think you shot yourself if there wasn't the sound of a gun firing, if there wasn't the sound of a gun firing they wouldn't have issued a citation for discharge of a weapon in a park...there would also be medical records but he says there are none.

"Universal health care would fix so many issues with our country it‚Äôs wild. 

-	to start it forces people who want to retire to work for no reason. Causing a strain on jobs.  Or keeping people stuck in jobs because they get a good plan for their family. 
-	it greatly hurts unions as they need to bargain for it. They could only bargain for money and time off. 
-	it forces companies to hire part time workers. No more benefits for companies means they want full time workers doing 40 hours a week. 
-	people can get mental care they need and get rid of alot of shootings and people on the streets. 
-	people can get drug treatments and get users clean and in rehab facilities. 
-	far less bankruptcies . People with or without insurance claim medical debt as the main reason for filing. 
-	so so so much preventative care. No more waiting until things get really bad before going to the doctor. Same goes for helping those who need surgeries get it.

"My wife and I were in Detroit this weekend. We watched the Red Wings and former Kings goaltender Cam Talbot beat the Sabres on Saturday night, had late night Coney Dogs at American Coney, visited the Detroit Institute of Art on Sunday, and while walking around the downtown area around 4pm Sunday (and appreciating how unlike downtown L.A. it was), a bus pulled up with a large ""Harris for President"" mural on the side, and as it stopped and the door opened, a small crowd of pedestrians gathered around.

It was *not* Harris on board, but the lady that jumped out still appeared to be a very well liked politician, as one member of the crowd greeted her loudly and warmly with ""What up, dawg?!"" and she responded in kind, equally loudly and warmly.

After we'd passed through the crowd and emerged from the other side, my wife commented on what I had been feeling, the palpable, intense and positive energy emanating from the crowd.

""I've *never* felt anything like that,"" she said. And we've been at Southern Cross Station when a game let out and \~50,000 football fans descended on the platforms. That had nothing on this Sunday's experience.

This wasn't even President Harris, this was ""*just*"" for a local politician, but the atmosphere was *incredibly* positive.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"If it helps any one here, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have voted blue in every election since 1988 except once for Trump in 2016 before immediately reverting back for Biden in 2020.

That's over 30+ years of going blue (save for once) and I don't suspect it'll be any different this election, and I certainly would be shocked if they break their decades-long streak of all voting the same party.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"From a [Micheal Moore Essay](https://www.michaelmoore.com/p/dear-donald-a-dear-john-letter-to?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share) 

Are you that BIG A LOSER? Are you the biggest loser, Donald? I talked to all the historians at the Wharton School and at MIT and they‚Äôve never seen anything like it. No one has ever tried to steal three elections in a row. At least George W. Bush was able to actually win one. 

Donald, are you a bigger loser than George W. Bush?

You lost your first election by three million votes. Americans don‚Äôt like you, Donald. 

Then you lost your second election by 10 million votes. You always say you got more votes than any sitting president ever, and yet‚Ä¶ you still lost by 10 million votes. That‚Äôs how much people don‚Äôt like you.

Donald, you can do math can‚Äôt you? In 2020, seven million people liked Joe Biden more than you! Another 3 million, given the choice between Biden and You, chose ANYONE ELSE. That‚Äôs 84 million Americans, Donald, who voted against you. 84 Million! No sitting President has ever had that many people vote against him, Donald. No one.

Just you. 

Let me put it another way for you, Don. In 2016, there were 65 million people who voted against you. Four years later, it was 84 million people! That‚Äôs 19 million more people the second time! They weren‚Äôt illegal, Donald. They weren‚Äôt ‚Äúmade up‚Äù votes. It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúvoter fraud.‚Äù It was non-voters! They saw what you did for 4 years in the White House and they said to themselves, ‚ÄúFuck this guy!‚Äù And they stopped being non-voters. And they voted AGAINST you. That‚Äôs what happened.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Even thought many of them who participate in polls may be saying they will vote, I‚Äôm not sure all of them are actually going to show up this time, just because of how disastrous his campaign has been this cycle.

"> I just find it so bizarre that he's managed to gain any new supporters in recent years

That's the thing though. It seems *incredibly* unlikely his base has grown since 2020. Anecdotal, but throughout various subreddits I constantly see how *visible* support (signs, flags, etc) seems to have gone down in places they were entrenched in 2020.

His campaign this time around took the rhetoric of 2020 and turned it up to 100. It's so much more blatantly misogynistic, xenophobic, angry and racist. 

I just can't believe he has grown support among anyone outside of *maybe* white men, which won't be enough.

Harris' campaign on the other hand has been nearly flawless on messaging and has been much stronger than Biden's across all demographics in 2020. If she increases turnout we might see a blowout. Worse case if she matches Biden's, it will be a slim victory.

Like I feel like he's more than likely *lost* support, especially women who may vote behind closed doors. (But otherwise in polls say they are voting with their husbands) This was also *before* January 6, (which I know was the final straw for many) before the convictions, etc. I don't see how that *helps* grow his base.

"In essence, nothing. There were all of these predictions leading up to the 2020 election that kept building up to something major. The four years of nothing during his presidency were finally about to pay off! And it spread outside of Q to these other groups all jumping in with predictions of their own about ""the storm"" and ""waking the kraken"" and everything else. Trump was going to win by a landslide and start rounding up the deep state and satanic pedophiles in government. It was going to be literally everything his followers fantasized about - and more!

Then Biden won the election. But of course that was just a ruse to lure all of the democrats to DC where a secret military force loyal to Trump (who actually won) would arrest them and try them all in military courts. There were going to be mass executions and everything. Then the inauguration happened and there was no mass arrest and Biden was sworn in as president. So the date was moved further into the future and soon Trump would reveal himself as the real president. But that date came and went as well. And another date. And another one. There were predictions about all of the various court cases contesting the election results, and all of them fell flat. People were finally starting to get tired of the constant stream of predictions being wrong and it was getting harder and harder for them to just say ""Trust the plan"" when literally nothing was going their way. I think the final nail in the coffin was when Q jumped the shark and predicted JFK Jr was going to come back from the dead and reveal himself as a Trump supporter and Trump's new Vice President. Most of the remaining Q supporters gave up at this point, and the few who didn't were thoroughly mocked by the media when they actually showed up in Dallas waiting for the big reveal.

I honestly don't know if Q kept making predictions after this point because that was effectively the end of anyone caring or talking about it. There were a few different groups and documentaries around this time that claimed to have figured out the identify of the person/people behind Q but I don't know if there was ever 100% confirmation.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Yup.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"I've noted these things in a couple different comments over the last few days, but here are my observations: 

I voted early this year and the early voting location (which is a feeder location for a good portion of the county's early voters) was filled with mostly women. I'd say around 80% women. And of that, a good portion of those were fairly young women in the college-age'ish demographic. 

Adding to that: my daughter and her friends are in that age demographic. And they have a seething hatred of the GOP. They're not stupid. They've heard loud and clear that the GOP is the party of ""we don't care if carrying your rapist's baby to term kills you."" *All* her friends early voted for Harris. 

I'm not sure if older folks realize how pissed off and politically active young women are now. The GOP took the mask off and flat out told millions of women ""You don't fucking matter one bit to us except for the pretty white ones, because we gotta get enough white babies to ensure we're not replaced.""

"The only ones holding back abortion rights and student loan forgiveness are Republicans.  Harris is simply pushing reproductive rights as a referendum to push Dem control of both the WH and Congress.  If she had that, yes, she absolutely would restore those rights (and it was a right before, so to say it was unconstitutional is not factual).  That and it would put the Democrats in a much better position to replace a SC slot with their own if one comes up.  And, as I said before, no one wanted abortion left to the states.  That's just an excuse Trump is pushing to women Republicans to temper the furor within his ranks for overturning Roe.

And the Republicans don't do the same?  Look at their platforms.  Can't talk about the economy as a whole because it's improved, so they harp on inflation while ignoring that it was a global issue related to Covid.  They harp on immigration, which has never been a traditional first tier issue, but conveniently never mention the fact there's a sweeping bipartisan immigration bill in Congress waiting for them to sign.  They can't talk about infrastructure, so they talk about Israel and Ukraine.  They can't talk about healthcare or lowering prescription drugs, so they talk about Afghanistan.  They can't talk about job creation, so they talk about LGBTQ+ rights and boys on girls teams.  They can't talk about lower crime rates and instead complain that the data is corrupt.  They can't talk about the Covid response, so they discredit science.  They can't talk about manufacturing jobs and tech initiatives, so they discuss losing jobs to China and immigrants.  They can't really talk about the debt, so they talk about tax cuts (which overwhelmingly benefitted the very wealthy).  

Trump talked about passing infrastructure legislation. He didn't get it done.  Biden did.  Trump couldn't figure out how to distribute Covid vaccines, and then left a federal emergency up to the states and his son-in-law.  Biden immediately took control and got it done.  Trump talked of repeal and replace of the AFA, but he couldn't repeal it and then had to admit Republicans had no actual replacement plan. The number of uninsured Americans reached record lows under Biden.  Trump promised to decrease prescription prices.  Biden ACTUALLY decreased a number of prescription drugs and became the first admintration to negotiate drug prices with Medicare.  Trump signed zero immigrations laws during his tenure.  Biden got 3/4 of Congress to accept the most sweeping bipartisan immigration bill in 30 years (and was killed not because it was a bad bill, but because it made Trump look bad...because, you know, Republicans care about immigration).  He wanted gun control, a staple of the Democratic platform and a wildly political topic, and still got a modest bill signed to law.  Biden got environmental provisions, always a Dem platform, into the Inflation Reduction Act. 

So when you say that Democrats campaign on things that can't be fixed, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.  BTW when the last three Republican presidents blew up the economy, and then Democrats promised to fix it, what happened?  I'll wait here...

I don't know if sweeping student loan forgiveness will ever be supported, but if the Dems get Congress and the WH, they will absolutely codify abortion rights (which is supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans).   And states aren't forced when it's federal law.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

This is in part why they get accused of being pedos by that sort - ""my kids teacher wants to talk to him about sex while keeping it a secret from me"" sets off all the alarms. 

>Also men in dresses in ladies washrooms

This is entirely a rehash of 2nd wave trans exclusive radical feminism. At the core of it is the notion that men are evil, dangerous predators and women need spaces that are safe, protected from male predation. 

From there, they just don't accept that trans is real and accordingly that trans women are either men adopting a disguise to get access to vulnerable women, men who hate themselves enough to sexually mutilate themselves and men who emulate women because it's the only way they can claim patriarchal ownership of a woman. 

You'll notice very little effort is spent on trans men, and that's because TERFs don't feel threatened by what they see as women wearing a disguise to steal patriarchal power for themselves. 

Tl;Dr - it's worth interrogating what they believe and where they get it from, because these ideas don't just appear in their brains ex nihilo and usually have some kind of origin point and backing, often blown dramatically out of proportion and sensationalized but it's still worth understanding.

"Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged in a private meeting on Wednesday that Trump‚Äôs animosity toward the yet-to-be-released border deal puts Republicans in a serious bind as they try to move forward on the already complex issue. For weeks, Republicans have been warning that Trump‚Äôs opposition could blow up the bipartisan proposal, but the admission from McConnell was particularly striking, given he has been a chief advocate for a border-Ukraine package.

  


Now, Republicans on Capitol Hill are grappling with the reality that most in the GOP are loathe to do anything that is seen as potentially undermining the former president. And the prospects of a deal being scuttled before it has even been finalized has sparked tensions and confusion in the Senate GOP as they try to figure out if, and how, to proceed ‚Äì even as McConnell made clear during party lunches Thursday that he remains firmly behind the effort to strike a deal, according to attendees.

  


‚ÄúI think the border is a very important issue for Donald Trump. And the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and congresspeople that he doesn‚Äôt want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for it is ‚Ä¶ really appalling,‚Äù said GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump.

  


He added, ‚ÄúBut the reality is that, that we have a crisis at the border, the American people are suffering as a result of what‚Äôs happening at the border. And someone running for president not to try and get the problem solved. as opposed to saying, ‚Äòhey, save that problem. Don‚Äôt solve it. Let me take credit for solving it later.‚Äô‚Äù

  


GOP Sen. Todd Young of Indiana called any efforts to disrupt the ongoing negotiations ‚Äútragic‚Äù and said: ‚ÄúI hope no one is trying to take this away for campaign purposes.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúI would encourage (chief Senate GOP negotiator) James Lankford and other conservatives to produce a work product with which they will shortly allow conservatives like myself to review it and take heart that there are a number of us who won‚Äôt be looking to third parties and assessing the propriety of passing this bipartisan proposal,‚Äù Young said

"Of course it matters. I never said otherwise. But it is an incredibly unpopular issue. Even among Republicans it is unpopular.   
The ironic thing is that the Republicans who ended up voting to make abortion illegal got into office because Democrats were threatening more gun control laws.

They voted them in to make sure someone like Beto O'Rourke, who Biden said would be in charge of gun control, would not get in office.

CNN has got to be the worst station I have ever seen, they twist words and blatantly lie with 0 consequences, hope mark robinson wins the case against them even if it‚Äôs only 25k, it‚Äôs the principle.

The Atlantic article really details what his campaign was like after Biden dropped out is very telling. Trump could not remain disciplined for the entire campaign. I think when Joe dropped out of the race it literally broke Trumps mind. He could not understand why Biden dropped out and that it had to be some sort of coup. He will never understand it because he doesn't understand self sacrifice for the greater good. I think after that Trump wanted to lash out and that is why he brought back Kelly Anne Conway and Corey Lewandowski. These are two people that will never say no to him and be yes people to all his dumb ideas. I'm positive his stupid fake Taylor Swift endorsement was given the thumbs up by Lewandowski and it Wiles had no idea it was happening until it was on Twitter.

Hawley and Cruz were definitely both trying to angle January 6th into their moments to stand up and appeal to the base, but after Trump literally incited an insurrection, they both just fell flat on their faces. To Cruz' defense, he's very used to that.

Once that failed, and Trump remained, they FOR SOME REASON, let DeSantis run against him.

If he loses 2 elections that looked very winnable, one of which with the unprecedented note of losing to a candidate that replaced an incumbent president mid election, there‚Äôd have to at least be some reflection at the top level of the party about whether or not this strategy is sustainable especially with possible factors like Trump falling further behind with the popular vote and likely just being too old to run himself.

"That's pretty much a textbook dictator flaw:

>His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His ""unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,"" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei√üem und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.

>There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaos‚Äîand it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.

>**Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.**

>He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as ""the greatest actor in Europe,"" and wrote to a friend, ""I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history."" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish‚Äîhe would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat ""prodigious amounts of cake"" and ""put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.""

>He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.

>Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a ""half-mad rascal"" or a ""man with a beery vocal organ."" In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.

>Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

> Taylor Swift celebrated the culmination of the U.S. leg of the Eras Tour by encouraging fans to remember to vote on Election Day.

> In September, Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president, confirming that she would be casting her vote for the Democratic candidate.

> At first, Trump tried to brush off losing the endorsement of the most famous person in the world by calling Swift a &quot;Very liberal person&quot; and suggesting &quot;She&#039;ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.&quot; But he couldn&#039;t help from revealing just how big mad he was a few days later when he posted on Truth Social, &quot;I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT.&quot;.

"As a European, I can‚Äôt vote in the U.S. elections, but I can tell you this: your vote matters more than you might think, not just for America, but for the whole world. Here‚Äôs why:

1.	Global Impact: U.S. decisions on climate change, international trade, and global security affect everyone. Your vote influences policies that ripple far beyond American borders.

2.	Stand Up for Democratic Values: Voting is a powerful way to shape and protect democracy. In a world facing challenges to freedom and rights, every voice for fair representation matters.

3.	Address Shared Issues: From healthcare and education to climate action, many of the issues at stake in the U.S. elections are universal. Your vote impacts progress on these critical fronts.

So if you‚Äôre eligible, please vote today! You‚Äôre not only choosing leaders for the U.S.; you‚Äôre helping shape a world many of us believe in and support. Make your voice heard‚Äîtoday counts!",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Not a fan of Taylor Swift. Her entire persona is so meticulously curated that nothing feels real and her fanbase couldn't be more annoying if they tried. But, it's impossible to argue that her influence didn't help Biden win in 2020, which is why I was so critical of her for not endorsing Harris earlier in the race. She had already set a precedent by endorsing Biden in 2020, and to top it off, Trump was blatantly lying about her endorsement and posting fake AI images of her. Her reluctance to take a stance in the face of all of that was disappointing and frustrating.

All of that being said, I still appreciated how important it was for her fanbase to mobilize in this election in the same way it did in 2020, so I was relieved and grateful of her finally announcing her endorsement of Harris. Every vote matters so better late than never.

But now, today, on Election Day, when the final push is needed as much as possible and people need to be mobilized to finally, actually vote for ***Harris***, the candidate Taylor very publicly endorsed...all she can muster up is a single throwaway line about a reminder to vote? You already endorsed Harris! What could possibly be the motive to not highlight that?? Remind people of it! Remind them where their demi-god idol stands in this race! Make your Trump fans uncomfortable! Force them to reckon with their decisions! Shove it in their faces! Go big! Say it with your chest and let Brittany Mahomes hear it! If there were any ""damage"" to be done by endorsing Harris, it's already been done! What are you holding back for at this point??

I just don't understand her logic with this election. A reminder to get out and vote is good, but it's so lukewarm and conspicuously non-partisan. Yes, as I mentioned, she did very publicly endorse Harris already, so who's to say another message about it on Election Day would move the needle much at this point. But it just feels so strange and unnecessary to...avoid it? It goes back to everything being so meticulously curated. Leaving out any mention of Harris/Walz is absolutely deliberate and it brings me back to that same feeling of disappointment and frustration. It all just feels directly contradictory to the curated persona of feminist ally, and it bothers me to see another powerful billionaire quietly hedge their bets at a time that demands principled stands.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

2) Were raised to support the political majority side but later changed their political views

The extremely awkward fact is that the vast majority of millionaires and billionaires support Harris instead of Trump.

I guess that is a good thing, as long as Trump loses, but it just reinforces the point that Democrats are losing their status as the party of the working class.

For example Harris has shamefully come out in support of fracking, of gun ownership, and Israel. She opposed all of these things before she started receiving millions of dollars from the ultra wealthy.

"Yo, I'm not the one who originally levied criticism and I already said my piece about her resources. I'm not gonna get into it with y'all. We're talking political action, not her tour schedule. EVERYONE has shit going on. SHE has billions of fans and money. Whether she SHOULD have done more or not isn't what I've been talking about, only that she COULD have done more if that were her intent because she has the resources, in response to a previous comment, and that I am happy she has spoken up. \*Elated\* even.

I think we should bracket the tour thing as a factor here. I don't think it's fair even to Swift, for some reason I feel like that kinda undermines her agency or makes it out like she's not capable to walk and chew gum at the same time. She did walk and chew gum at the same time. I'm as stoked about what her actions could mean for future youth engagement as I am about her endorsement for Harris (well, almost). Getting out the vote is huge. So I think for my part it's good to have these conversations about stars' ability and responsibility when they get involved in political messaging. Whether you're a STAN or not she's a cultural force and that comes with a heavy dose of both. I am not a political strategist, so I can't say whether things would have been better if done differently, only that it's possible. Go Swifties.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

As the ultra wealthy generally lean conservative for their own benefit, the politicians they give money to will inevitably begin to lean that way as well. This is why we need to get money out of politics. Unfortunately, as long as money is in politics, the out-funding of the other party will inevitably be needed to win elections, and taking money from mega-donors will inevitably involve making icky promises and watering down left-wing politicians‚Äô platforms.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

She has to tend the kids so she doesn't really have time for the celeb stuff.  She also toned down her shtick after Pat's manager and PR people had a long talk with her. I'm not defending her in any way, she is still immature and entitled...but most 20-somethings today seem to be that way too.

Sure if Brit wasn't mahomes' wife, Swift wouldn't give her the time of day, but in the end this is just the 'politics of personality and fame'. You may not actually like someone but you have to be photographed near them and smiling for the world to see.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"""I think he's a brilliant businessman, and I think he knows how to use the media and manipulate it to his advantage... He is the consummate showman. I admire him for that."" 
~Ron Perlman (2011 interview from The Hollywood Reporter). 

Fast forward to 2016:

‚ÄúF**k every last one of you who voted for this piece of sh*t.‚Äù



‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good businessman. He‚Äôs a good promoter. He‚Äôs got a sense of how to sell himself. I respect that."" 
~Robert DeNiro (2011 interview from The Hollywood Reporter)

By 2018:
""Fk Trump! It‚Äôs no longer 'Down with Trump.' It‚Äôs 'Fk Trump!'""

What happened? 

Cancel culture gained momentum in 2016 and the #MeToo movement gained steam by 2017 as well as woke culture. 

So pre-2016 Perlman was largely singing his praise as was DeNiro, but by the time cancel culture took off, their rhetoric shifted to align with all the other individuals trying to keep cancel culture off their back. 

Before 2016 Trump was a well-regarded and well-respected business mogul. 

What happened?

Weinstein happened. 

In October 2016, just before the presidential election, a bombshell story about Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs long history of alleged sexual harassment was published by The New York Times. The article detailed years of allegations from women about Weinstein‚Äôs inappropriate behavior, which ranged from harassment to assaults.

Trump's remarks:

‚ÄúI‚Äôve known him for a long time. I‚Äôm not surprised to hear it. ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve known him for a long time. I‚Äôm not a fan of Harvey Weinstein, and I‚Äôve been saying that for a long time. I was never a fan of his, I can tell you that.""

Weinstein was a major donor for Trump's political rival Hillary Clinton. 

Epstein happened:

The real estate rivalry between Trump and Epstein occurred in the early 2000's. 

Trump was attempting to sell a property in Palm Beach, and Epstein showed interest in buying it. However, the deal fell through. One of the reasons given for this was that Trump was unwilling to sell the property to Epstein after learning more about his activities and the kind of reputation Epstein had developed. This rejection led to a reported confrontation between the two men, and, in a turn of events, Palm Beach police were reportedly called when Epstein became upset.

I know this is very long but it's honestly totally crazy. Like right out of the movies. Trump is freaking vicious. The guy had a hand in strategically bringing down one of the most powerful moguls in Hollywood and even sacrificed himself to do it. Clinton's people release his locker room talk tape and the guy gets even. They all have dirt on each other, but he's a lot better at manipulation. Weinstein was ruined, eaten by his own people and guys like Perlman even said, (paraphrasing) ""Not all of use are equally guilty."" Ha, something to hide perhaps? 

So no, Trump is not afraid of Kamala IMO. Hollywood appears to be petrified of Trump.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"One thing I've always thought about Trump (as someone who despises him and what he stands for) is that he can't really be compared to anyone. Definitely not anyone in America's history, or most first world countries for that matter. The combination of circumstances that created his personality, created his career and image, and led to his election feels like some kind of black swan event.

This is why I don't get too upset at people being blindsided by his victory in 2016. How and why would you possibly prepare for a phenomenon like him?

Internationally, I feel like he has a lot in common with Berlusconi. He was also (seen as) a successful businessman, political outsider, populist, brash, ""impolite"" etc. I don't know that much about his political career but I'm aware of those basics.

You also have populists like Bolsonaro, and rogue soft authoritarians like Netanyahu and Erdogan where you could draw some comparisons, but many differences too.

If I'm taking a long view, I personally think and hope that history will remember him as a bizarre blip more than anything. Sort of like how Spain was randomly a fascist dictatorship for like 40 years, but a democracy before and after. Or how Oliver Cromwell overthrew the monarchy but then it was reinstated after him.

Tl;dr my take is that W and Reagan are more representative of our political system, and Trump is more of a bizarro detour.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

However, Trump might make a good result in term of popular votes, since his campaign since Biden withdrew has been all about mobilizing his base, so he might make good results (but not enough to win) in CA, NY and and other blue states, by getting the people who usually don't vote because it's pointless.

The Libertarian Establishment is entirely compromised at this point by Billionaires and Republicans it should always be treated as a republican proxy.

For a long time now the Republicans and Billionaires have scouted universities and recruited young libertarians to shill right wing politics and very little people seem to be aware. There is a reason both Peter Thiel and JD Vance had rich republican boyfriends that funded them in college and afterwards they immediately try to destroy the democracy.

"There is no excuse for this.  Oregon pioneered Vote By Mail starting in 1981 local elections.  In 1998 the voters passed Measure 60, a citizen initiative measure under which we adopted vote by mail/dropbox as the exclusive means of voting in all elections.  We were the first state to provide free return envelopes for ballots.

WE HAVE NEVER HAD ANY SIGNIFICANT FRAUD.  There have been isolated instances of mischief, but the number is tiny and there has never been anything substantial enough to affect even the furthest down ballot small town race.

Voter turnout is amazing! Great job everyone! But don't forget that massive lines is just voter suppression by the right. They didn't have to have fewer polling places. They don't have to have slower mail services or on-fire drop boxes. This is what voter suppression looks like. Please don't get lazy. They expect you to. They expect you to leave and assume that other's will be enough. They want you to go home. Please don't. Your voice matters and your vote makes a difference. We just had a provincial vote here in BC Canada. The number of votes in some districts deciding the winner was less than 100. In some places less than 30 votes! You're doing good.

PA already had a big democrat lead in mail-ins (unsurprisingly) but we need to also see high turnout on Election Day. Since Election Day is traditionally where republicans close the gap in states with mail-ins.

There‚Äôs also the fact that Trump encouraged republicans to vote early this time, so that should have increased turnout for early voting for Rs and tipped the scales a little bit away from Election Day voting. So we might be seeing a slightly lower republican turnout today, but since we‚Äôre still seeing a high total turnout, it could very well be more democrats at the polls.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

You're there with your 3 kids. They're bored. They have to pee. They have to eat. You might be earning a paycheck since its a paid holiday but the hourly guy behind you isn't. Oh, shoot, there's an Election Day Sale going on at the Macy's. 

Basically what people want is to treat Election Day like Thanksgiving or Christmas, but it doesn't mean enough to most people to warrant that kind of impact.

There are many other options to fix Election Day but the National Holiday isn't one of them.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

If they can organise their normal activities, they can certainly organise the erection of a few wooden polling booths and two people at a table to cross off voters. And have some more operating out of the back of vans in rural areas for good measure.


But I know these issues are at least partly due to fuckery by elected officials, and it astounds me whenever it comes up that the US doesn't have an independent body or bodies for organising elections, drawing boundaries etc., multiple steps removed from democracy and given several layers of protection from interference by elected officials to make it as incorruptible as possible.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

It‚Äôs also the first huge pandemic to happen after the uprise in smartphones and social media; combine that with the fact that all of this just so happen to line up with the next election; one which has an already established cult personality and extremist ideologies and the other bordering on dementia and total incompetence and you have recipe for disaster.

Through social media; people petaled the idea that Covid was a huge lie and scandal by the US government as an excuse to control the population. So in this time of crisis; where the government built by the people, for the people; what‚Äôs to do its job and do what it SHOULD do, and HELP end the crisis by taking preventive measures and precautions; people take that as ‚ÄúYOU DICTATORS AIN‚ÄôT TAKING MY RIGHTS AWAY‚Äù. So this insane group of people thought they were gonna be revolutionaries and overthrow a tyrannical government when in reality; they were defying a perfectly reasonable government trying its best in a time of crisis. 

Then trump got more unhinged; his followers listened and you could write an entire book about how unhinged he is. Elon bought twitter, turned it into an algorithmic nightmare of anti- semitism, racism, anti-intellectualism and general xenophobia. 

While children get their minds rotted away by algorithms, so do fully grown adults; everyday, people just get more and more sucked into varying false realities and sludges of misinformation; hyper reality turning people more and more into what is effectively a caricature of the people they watch and listen to all day; like Trump, Tucker, Alex jones, etc. And the anti-intellectualism of these individuals trickles right back down to the viewers. 

Many People don‚Äôt stop and think ‚Äúwait this guy is just being racist‚Äù they subconsciously absorb and agree with these people like they are literal gods and keepers of all that is true and ‚ÄúFighters against the lies that THEY don‚Äôt want you to know‚Äù whoever ‚ÄúThey‚Äù is. 

And it‚Äôs not like you can just ignore these people either unfortunately because their actions have real consequences on all the reasonable folks in the US and likely similar effects around the world with different talking heads spouting equal or worse rhetoric. 

The end result is a world full of people turning into entitled and radicalized zombies; most sense of former personality erased; ‚Äúnow exist to serve my conservative anti-vax, xenophobic overlords; must obey, must storm capital, must take guillotine, and bring it to capital, must obey orange man, must obey Tucker;
Alex Jones is always right too‚Äù

Meanwhile, even folks outside of the politically obsessed become more unhinged by the day as well. People want to confirm their biases or feel entitled to certain things and so you have people that are like ‚ÄúLadies, if your man doesn‚Äôt buy you Starbucks everyday, he ain‚Äôt worthy of you‚Äù or incel groups of men that gather together and form a collective hatred of women.

Effectively, we‚Äôre just now in the part of the Information Age where we‚Äôre seeing this radical shift in culture and how people perceive the world around them; for some it creates a positive difference; such as people realizing and coming together to say that it‚Äôs okay to be gay/bi/trans, etc. to say that racism is bad, to say that ‚ÄúTraditional values‚Äù has become a dog whistle for hate and discrimination. 

Meanwhile, on the other end of the stick; you have people who say the exact opposite; that ‚Äúeveryone I don‚Äôt like is bad‚Äù that ‚Äúall those WOKE people are weird‚Äù, etc.

The end result; pure chaos!",2024_11_06,05_05_54

It‚Äôs not me, I go out of my way to be brief and use simple language. but it‚Äôs like some people aren‚Äôt processing, some people tune out if you say more than three words and some people seem like they‚Äôre doing both.

I work at a small airport and all day long people get confused by the airport queues.

"The answer is ""Me Ne Frego"", a story about how fascism became the ruling force in Italy.

When Mussolini was rising to power in Italy his rivals get killed by blackshirts, a militia loyal to Mussolini and fascists. With every death the response is ""Me Ne Frego"" which is a slang for I don't give a damn. After many condemnations and the ones who condemn the killings getting killed, Mussolini comes to the parliament, admits that all murders were ordered and sponsored by him and he is taking full charge. This time the parliament didn't give a damn because they were conditioned to what the fascists are.

They don't give a damn and they wanna drag the whole country into same carelessness but much thankfully unlike Italian fascism MAGA(who also aren't as extremist) are not able to plant fear into American hearts to make them uninterested of what's going on.

"Yes, but also not necessarily. 

Ann Selzer has an insane track record and has only missed twice. (2004 Presidentual race and the 2018 governor's race.)

She was the proverbial canary in the coal mine for Clinton's narrow loss in 2016 and the signal that Biden wasn't going to run away with it in 2020. 

There has been *some* evidence that the Sun Belt is moving towards Trump while the Rust Belt (of which Iowa is sort of part of) is solidifying more towards Harris, mainly due to her surprising strength with white voters. (The Sun Belt is more diverse.) This poll doesn't dispute that, but it could suggest she's doing better with white voters than anyone thought..

At the very least, it could prove to be good signals for important neighboring electoral votes, mainly Wisconsin and Nebraska-2 (which is incredibly important in the Harris-wins-with-270 path) because they are demographically similar.

 In the best case, it heralds a blowout, and we'll all be like, ""I mean, obviously, the signs were there all along"" this time tomorrow. 

Worst case, it's an outlier.

EDIT: The other ""worst case"" is that Harris wins Iowa, but it's more due to Iowa politics and the draconian abortion ban passed this summer and less a signal she'll blow Trump out.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

1. The most accurate pollster is correct. It's a signal that all the polls have been off and women are turning out in extreme numbers to take back their rights. Iowa flips, or is very close.

2. The most accurate pollster is correct and Iowa is flipping but other states don't have the same turnout / change.

3. The most accurate pollster is wrong and Iowa is a Trump landslide victory.

The long and short of it is that even if Trump wins Iowa, but it's by 2% instead of 10%, this could be a signal that the race isn't as close as we are led to believe, because if he can't carry a red state like Iowa, then he's going to have trouble with toss up states.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Mix that with the rage bait propaganda machines and give them a figurehead that appeals to the most base, reactive lizard parts of the brain, and it‚Äôs the perfect combo to find ourselves in a situation like present.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"You can read about it on a lot of technical wonky/statistics blogs (meaning this isn't some super secret), but the short answer is that they don't know how to get Trump right in polls.

The basic fear is that they have overcorrected, because they were wrong in both 2016 and 2020 (Biden won but they had him winning by more than he did in 2020, for example). So, the idea is that they have now overcorrected for it and are weighing Trump voters more/too much. Now, they could have gotten the models right this time, but there are a few reasons that might not be the case:

1. They aren't capturing some demographic that is behaving in a non-traditional manner (in 2016/2020 they weren't capturing the male white working class pissed off voters that broke for Trump). If Iowa is right, this time they might not be capturing pissed off white women correctly. This could be an across the board problem, but because Selzer does her polls in a pretty different way, her model is hard to replicate outside of Iowa (also note that Iowa just banned abortion, I think).
2. It's unlikely that every state everywhere is statistically tied: again this would be connected to overcorrecting, but we should see a little more variation than we are seeing.
3. There are weird things going on with down-ballot races. If you look at 538 and at a few polls you'll see it. In Nevada for example the Senate race is looking pretty good for Dems but Trump is up on the presidential ballot. That means that 4-8% (in some states), will have split votes heavily favoring a Dem in the Senate and Trump at the top. This just seems odd. It could be possible, but is odd.
4. The big one: Nobody knows how to poll anymore. The under 45 crowd doesn't answer the phone. Apparently, even when Gen Z does answer the phone they lie or just say undecided when they aren't (this could go either way). People that never voted seem to be voting this year too.

But, all this tea leaf reading at this point. Just need to vote and see what happens. Anyone acting certain at this point isn't being honest. Here is perhaps an overly [optimistic blog about it though](https://app.vantagedatahouse.com/analysis/TheBlowoutNoOneSeesComing-1?fbclid=IwY2xjawGXIjNleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHZdIYPBjL1ZWUFcrHOg47PXDbHjwJO2U4D7hhMBNW7VIrmXgbNE2frhvBg_aem_1Z_958_5laOLP6KUUpYkAw).",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Weren't the Saudis involved in that purchase?

EDIT: Ah, yes, there it is: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2022/10/31/saudi-prince-alwaleed-becomes-twitters-second-largest-shareholder/

"Musk needs to have ALL US government contracts revoked, and anything that the military depends on gets nationalized. Tough sh\*t because he's an enemy of the State. There's no way his Security Clearance can be okay after all this sh\*t. 

Also revoke his citizenship, he doesn't get to do this. There are rules and the whole ""not for billionaires!!"" game is f\*cked, That's why we HAVE laws. Otherwise it's the rich just own and eat the poor however they like.

What a lot of these rich dudes have forgotten is that the reason that they ever agreed to the rule of law concept was that they kept getting over run with torches and pitchfork mobs and that's very difficult and expensive to deal with, as well as sometimes resulting in all your stuff and also your life gettiing taken.

Yeah. That's a sh\*t system. Let's not go back to that, it's not in anyone's interests.

Musk has far overplayed his hand here but that's what happens when you do a bunch of K and amphetamines and actually start to think you're a God or something.

\-  Musk could cost him Nevada bigly.  If the counties around Reno swing hard left its because the locals are pissed about his poorly run lithium factories that ruin the environment, ugly, and cover up safety / environmental stuff.  

\-  The guy doesn't belong in a US election.  Its like if I hired Fabio and sent him to Wisconsin to babble about butter.

"Musk should be dragged before Congress to talk about all the nefarious shit he‚Äôs been up to. Subpoena him, every internal email, every text message he has sent, all of it. Congress can investigate whatever it pleases whenever it pleases.

After all, when he took over Twitter, he was all about highlighting what he felt were the political missteps of his predecessors; it‚Äôs only fair that he face similar scrutiny.

If he refuses the subpoena, send him straight to prison until he agrees to talk to Congress. Send a message to all the shithead billionaires in this country who believe their money affords them protection from the consequences of their behavior.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"The panel of experts that runs the Saudi Public Investment Fund evaluated Kushner's investment firm, Affinity Partners (founded in 2021), as a potential investment opportunity. The firm's goal was apparently to foster business between Muslims and Israelis by investing in Israel based tech companies.

The panel objected, citing ""the inexperience of the Affinity Fund management"" (Kushner has no real track record in this space), the fact that Saudi Arabia would be responsible for the ""bulk of the investment and risk"" (they only had $500M under management at the time, and hadn't made any investments), a management fee that ""seems excessive"" (higher than any other competitor, and an included $25M direct bonus to Kushner no matter the performance), and ultimately ruled the company ""unsatisfactory in all aspects"".

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman then overruled the panel, without providing any real reason why, and quintupled the firm's assets under management with a $2B investment.

The irony¬† is he does so without any attempt to hide his evilness, his followers just close their eyes to it. Truly the banality of evil.¬†


The fact is though in wider context, Christianity is declining in the US and that's a good thing. There is nothing more antithetical to the Gospel than a cultural Christianity that tricks people about their salvation. Your faith is yours alone, the faith of your parents, grandparents, friends, children, or spouse doesn't matter. It's just you and God. Everything else can be a distraction. Trump is helping to end cultural Christianity. The remnants if Christians who remain will actually be Christians, and I don't mean people who hole up in tiny rural churches afraid if the world.

If we are to take the Bible seriously, we must be open to the idea that Trump is the Antichrist

I've discussed this idea a couple of times with religious folks, but it's usually met with a chuckle as if they don't REALLY believe in the Antichrist OR they're too proud to admit they have themselves been duped.

[The Antichrist will be a man who is exceptionally arrogant and will be known for giving boastful speeches.](https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm)

Trump is a loudmouth.  Always threatening.

*Revelation 13:2 - The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a* ***mouth like that of a lion***\*. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.\*

&#x200B;

**RISE TO POWER** The Antichrist‚Äôs rise to power will seem like a miracle that God performed, tricking people into following Satan instead of God without even noticing.

*2 Thessalonians 2:9 - The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie.*

When the Antichrist comes, look for powerful religious folks claiming it was a miracle from God.

‚ÄúHe did everything wrong, politically. He offended gays. He offended women. He offended the military. He offended black people. He offended the Hispanic people. He offended everybody! And he became president of the United States. Only God could do that.‚Äù -  [Franklin Graham](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/franklin-graham/527013/)

&#x200B;

Another major signs to warn us of the arrival of the Antichrist would be an election where someone won with fewer supporters, and where it was also proven that an evil outside power meddled with the process to specifically put that person in office.

\*\*\*--\*\*\**Daniel 11:21 -  ‚ÄúThe next to come to power will be a despicable man who is not in line for royal succession. He will slip in when least expected and take over the kingdom by flattery and intrigue.*

*Daniel 11:23 - ""After coming to an agreement with him, he will act deceitfully, and with only a few people he will rise to power.""*

&#x200B;

\*\*--\*\*Donald Trump has [floated idea of serving more than two terms.](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-negotiate-third-term-in-office-2020-9)

*Daniel 11:24 - When the richest provinces feel secure, he will invade them and will achieve what neither his fathers nor his forefathers did. He will distribute plunder, loot and wealth among his followers. He will plot the overthrow of fortresses--but only for a time.*

*Daniel 7:25 - He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time.*

This leads into *Daniel 8:25* ***He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior.***

The Bible predicts the Antichrist will be someone who negotiates powerful real estate deals with friends [predicts the Antichrist will be someone who negotiates powerful real estate deals with friends.](https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-39.htm)

\*\*--\*\*Revelation 13 [very specifically tells us](https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm) that somewhere in the middle of his first three and a half years in office, the Antichrist will give a very specific and telling speech: he will arrogantly brag of his accomplishments and ‚Äògreat‚Äô things, and will also use God‚Äôs name in a way considered to be blasphemy.

[Trump uses Lord's name in vain at NC rally](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/12/trump-evangelicals-blasphemy-profanity-1456178)

Daniel 11:37-38 - He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all. Instead of them, he will honor a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his ancestors he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts.

The Bible says that [instead of worshipping the true God, the Antichrist will worship an unknown God of fortresses](https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-38.htm)

Fortress translates to border walls.

"Three ideas about this:

1. There's considerable overlap between communities of white working class people, conservative Christian communities, and Trump supporters. It kind of makes sense. In poorer and more rural areas, the church might be the most important institution around. They can provide social outlets, security, and charity. For decades, many have felt abandoned by Washington. They like Trump because he's speaking to them directly and appears to be fighting the fight on their behalf. They're convinced that building the wall will lead to more jobs. They feel left by behind by progressive policies that (they believe) will priviledge people of color and LGBTQ+ groups over themselves. If Trump is a little corrupt and gives tax cuts to the rich, they view this as a small price to pay. 

2. Trump's base have successfully convinced themselves (with the major help of several extremely conservative media outlets) that every attack on Trump is a witch hunt and that the Democrats are making up all of his crimes. Obviously, he's famously done some unchristian things that can't be covered up completely, but they can claim that the left is exaggerating and that he's God's imperfect vessel, etc, etc. 

3. The right has spent decades turning abortion into a major wedge issue and convincing conservative Christians that it's the most important thing in the world. Whatever Trump does wrong, they'll convince themselves that it was worth it to overturn Roe v Wade. And of course they want to go much further by blocking abortion access on a federal level now and they know it won't happen under Harris. 

I doubt very much that Trump's loss would change many opinions from his base. The GOP generally may be ready to abandon Trump as he'll clearly show that he has no path to victory after two election losses, and a major loss in the popular vote in 2016. But I suspect his base will continue to search for their next right wing hero for the foreseeable future.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Most Americans who identify as Christians, don't think of themselves as just one subsect of christianity. Christians are broken down into two large sub-sets, catholics and protestants. The protestants are broken down into dozens and dozens of smaller subsets.

Because each of those small Protestant subsets would shit their beds if they had to think of themselves as part of this tiny off shoot congregation, they all like to collectively assume the most superlative nomenclature of their faith, Christian. And then gatekeep it so they can all keep the rest out, like Catholics and what not.

When American christians go on about the Bible, they don't know that this concept of Biblical inerrancy and Biblical superiority, is a recent Protestant invention. Like the Rapture.

It was a heavy minority district and the location had 2 voting booths in it. I moved to a lower population (with whiter and lighter population) location a year later and it had 15 voting booths.

That's correct! The [ACLU Voter's Rights ](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights#what-are-my-general-rights-on-election-day)page also does a great job explaining this and helping voter's through what to do under such scenarios,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"Correct.  However, it should be your last option.   Both because in some cases it isn't appropriate (your provisional vote would never be counted) and because in others there could be a way to vote normally.

Here are a few things you should try first.

1. Try to identify the exact issue, if necessary, by having the poll worker call up the board of elections.  But there are some issues that might be able to be handled at the polling place with just a note made to check up on you later.  If this is the case, you'll be able to vote normally.  For others (you thought you were supposed to vote at X but you're actually supposed to vote at Y), you should go to Y instead, since any provisional you file at X might not be counted.

2. If you can take the time out, court orders are always preferable to provisionals.  This is what you might go for if for instance you registered six years ago but never voted and now you're suddenly not on the rolls because the state purged you.  To get one, you have to go to the county judge with whatever proof of eligibility the situation demands.  But when you come back, you can vote normally, no provisional.

If you do end up in the situation where you know you're registered and you know where you're supposed to be voting, but there's still some kind of issue nobody can figure out, \*and\* you can't go to the judge or have nothing to show them there, that's when you go for the provisional.

Remember that poll workers get only a few hours of training per year.  We don't know everything.  So feel no shame in asking them to call the board of elections to clarify things; the BoE will figure it out.  Just be super polite please; it's a long day.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Republicans did a hardcore propaganda campaign towards this demo during the Cold War and convinced many of them that Dems were either commies or commie-sympthetic, or too weak against the regime.

">So due to the cultural construct of whiteness, you get Cuban-Americans sometimes being starkly reminded that they aren't fully part of the system due to their last name, even if they might otherwise ""pass"" and get the advantages of being whiteness. 

Pretty much. If you're a white Hispanic, they just won't consider you white. Even if they do, it doesn't mean you'll be treated equally. White nationalists simultaneously believe race is an objective biological thing that exists *and* that if you have blonde hair and blue eyes but your last name is Rodriguez or Goldstein then you're not actually white. Racists themselves are the biggest proof that race is a social construct and not something biological.

>What really drives me nuts about this is conservative Catholics who don't realize that if Christian Nationalists ever win, they are all in serious danger.

Mainstream Christian nationalism in the U.S. tends to be somewhat inclusive of Catholics. After all, many of the prominent figures - Kevin Roberts, JD Vance, Nick Fuentes, John McEntee, etc. - are Catholic. Heck, Peter Thiel and Elon Musks are atheists and part of that movement. 

But it's a temporary and convenient alliance: if they get power, they're gonna set their sights on Catholics, Mormons, Orthodox, any liberal Protestant churches, etc. Latinos are often stuck in a Catholic bubble (language barrier doesn't help) and often don't know that a lot of Evangelical Protestants really hate Catholics.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

On days where I dress like a ""white"" person (black tee and beige cargos), the Latino customers either ask me questions first in English because they think I'm not Latino, or ask me if I know Spanish because they have a hunch I might be one but they're not sure. If they don't know English, they ask for a translator, and that's when I surprise them with Spanish.

On days where I dress more stereotypically Latino (baggy blue jeans, white Nike basketball shoes, earrings, thin gold chain and a watch), like 95% of the time the Latino customers immediately ask me questions in Spanish. They just know. In recent years I've been dressing more like this basically as a response to MAGA (I also just like the style) and to signal to other Latinos that I'm one of them and that they can talk to me in Spanish.

I'll tell you this: when I was in K-12, I never perceived myself as being the same race as the blonde/ginger white kids. After all, those kids insisted I wasn't white, and Latinos themselves use ""blanco"" to mean northern Europeans when talking in an American context (in a Latin American context, I would be considered *blanco* by other Latinos, but I suddenly become *not* white when in an American context). So I didn't perceive myself as white because all the cultural messaging I was getting was telling me I wasn't. I perceived myself as Hispanic and nothing else. When I first played Skyrim, I selected Imperial rather than Nord. The cultural messaging runs deep.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"""Whiteness"" is really a deliberate construction of not-black.  We created a caste system to convince poor ""whites"" that their interests were not aligned with poor blacks, to bolster slavery, Jim Crow, and other kinds of anti-black discrimination.

"Depends on where you were. White/Black dominates the South and a fair bit of the North. So Native and Asian heritage mostly got overlooked (Chang Bunker and Eng Bunker, the famous conjoined twins, were considered white in North Carolina, and married white women and owned slaves). Mixed race people might pass themselves off as Native to get around the social and legal restrictions of being black.

But out west, Latino, Asian and Native heritage mattered a lot more, like in NE when large Irish populations started to come, or the Mid Atlantic with Italians. 

You can see how narrow whiteness was to some by literature. An insane example is the poem ""*Providence in 2000 A.D*"" by HP Lovecraft, which shows his bigoted view on what is white is very limited, with French and Swedes among the many groups he sneers at it.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

One is a unit of mass and one is a unit of force/weight, even if you convert one to the other the value is different.

""Newton's you've gotta divide by 10 all the time"" - Supposedly genius engineer who doesn't know the value of acceleration due to gravity.

Also to give you what, dividing thrust by acceleration due to gravity doesn't give you anything. Dividing thrust by g gives you kg in terms of units, but it doesn't mean anything. He's confusing thrust as a force and weight as a force and converting that to mass. It's also 9.81m/s2 not 10, no engineer would say g is 10.

Then he talks about dividing by 10 thousand to get tonnes, clearly not knowing a metric tonne and an imperial ton he started with are different units. Even if it was it would be 1 thousand not 10.

Scientific calculations typically use SI units like newtons, but ton-force is commonly used in rocketry because it's practical for discussing large thrust numbers:

\- This rocket needs 1,961,330 newtons of thrust  
\- This rocket needs 2000 ton force of thrust

In engineering, it's common to approximate gravity to 10 for quick mental math, especially in real time discussions. Nobody is dividing by 9.81 in their heads.

The advantages of using ton-force is that it roughly has a 1:1 ratio to the mass in tons. A 200 ton rocket needs about 200 ton force to lift. This makes it more intuitive for quick discussions than dealing with these gigantic newton values.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"Nah, they definitely should know these things, some of it is highschool physics.

I'll paste what I wrote another comment:

https://youtu.be/t705r8ICkRw?t=2162

""why are you talking about thrust in tons, it's not technically a scientific thing."" - Dude who doesn't know every aviation/aerospace company in America uses aside from NASA Imperial units not SI. I'm sure Lockheed Martin would disagree about tons ""not technically a scientific thing""

""Newton's you've gotta divide by 10 all the time"" - Supposedly genius engineer who doesn't know the value of acceleration due to gravity.

Also to give you what, dividing thrust by acceleration due to gravity doesn't give you anything. Dividing thrust by g gives you kg in terms of units, but it doesn't mean anything. He's confusing thrust as a force and weight as a force and converting that to mass. It's also 9.81m/s2 not 10, no engineer would say g is 10.

Then he talks about dividing by 10 thousand to get tonnes, clearly not knowing a metric tonne and an imperial ton he started with are different units. Even if it was it would be 1 thousand not 10.

First year engineers should know what a Newton is.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

How does the sun burn in space, Daddy? Well, you see, this smart guy a hundred years ago figured out that matter and energy are equivalent. So if something is really heavy, it can turn into a lot of energy. The Sun is really heavy, and it is not technically burning the way you and I know fire, but it is very, very hot, because all that matter is changing into energy!

"I was reading a book about Reagan and FDR recently and the way that both of those men shaped our modern political landscape is astounding. Reagan in particular, everything about him screamed 'proto-Trump' it was uncanny. Immediately there's the obvious comparisons such as how they were both divorced despite campaigning on a religious platform or that Trump and Reagan were both celebrities turned politicians - though Trump's transition was much more dramatic - however their rhetoric also seems to be strikingly similar. I guess Reagan also severely leaned into this super-evangelical  'America is God's chosen land' rhetoric that's become disturbingly prominent with the GOP. Furthermore he also had the same 'just keep say things with enough confidence and it becomes reality' philosophy that Trump seems to have when giving a speech. I suppose that, like Trump, many of the anecdotes and facts Reagan would share in speeches were just patently false but because he said it with enough conviction his supporters would believe it. It also doesn't help that the political philosophy of both presidents is shaped by convincing American's that they're victims of high taxation, something which is bitterly ironic to anyone aware of taxation statistics. Finally, though a bit pedantic, I guess Reagan also believed in astrology meaning Trump was nowhere near the first time complete pseudoscience had entered the white house, though even then at the time it seems like conservatives had enough of a spine to criticize Reagan for this while nowadays conservatives celebrate Trump for believing conspiracy theories.

Obviously there's differences, Reagan for example at least demonstrated some level of competency and respectability that Trump seriously lacks, but the similarities are staggering.

If the demonstrations had been handled differently, or had been less violent, who knows, perhaps we would have avoided the entire Nixon debacle.

This is a really good example of why people who understand how to organize non violent protests need to teach the next generation the practical How to Do it's.  It's not all that easy, it's actually a skill set.  One violent act by one angry person in a demonstration become the excuse for a police riot.

">admitting they were wrong means coming to grips with the fact that they fell for racist/homophobic propaganda for decades

This is poor framing.  They didn't ""fall"" for anything, because this is how the nation *was*, as in ""it was common knowledge"" (that  ultimately was wrong).  Anybody liberal enough to take a modern perspective on AIDS for example, would have been so marginalized as to not be taken seriously.  You literally had Moral Majority groups (the forerunners of Christian Nationalists) saying gay men *deserved* to die from AIDS, and this wasn't *nearly* as unpopular of an idea back then as it would be today.  Even some non-trivial subset of the Democrats would have shrugged their shoulders if someone said that to their face.  People literally believed that homosexuality was a *rare* thing because very very few people were out of the closet.

Anybody born after about 1990 really can't grasp where society was with LGBTQ sensibilities before that time.  There were a tiny number of culturally significant people, like John Waters, who were willing to go ""I don't give a rip *what* society wants, I'm going to just be very open about this stuff that nobody wants to talk about, and I'm going to make movies and musicals about it,"" but he, and those like him, were seen as *subversive*, bordering on terrorists.  Gen X was probably the first generation that even *began* to question whether any of this stuff even *was* subversive.  The Greatest Generation (that's Reagan's generation) was still alive and still very much in control, and they were, almost without exception, **positive** that an LGBTQ lifestyle was subversive.

Back then, sweeping the South (in opposition to LBJ signing the Civil Rights Act) wasn't enough for Goldwater to win, but it unified the Southern segregationists under the Republican tent for the first time. But people like a winner, and Goldwater got crushed. So the strategy didn't really bear a success until Reagan. Nixon was broadly popular, and didn't need to leverage segregationist sentiment or ""Law and Order"" rhetoric (again, the idea that the President should be involved in our local policing was something that Goldwater famously brought back into Republican policy).

It's also very inconvenient year after year to say third parties are 'wasted votes' while at the same time saying you are into 'protecting' democracy. 

I have news for everyone here. A Trump vote in Massachusetts or a Harris vote in Oklahoma hold the same impact as a Chase Oliver or Cornel West in the majority of this country. 

The main difference? 

Voting third party means that if a third party gets five percent, they get federal election funding. Meaning this two party system everyone bitches about but still bizarrely still want to protect (the vote blue no matter who or better red than dead crowds) would be a thing of the past. 

However, in my experience, most voters don't actually care about 'fixing the system' any more than voting for one of the two major parties, more often than not the Democratic party. 

We can act upon the work that Fairvote does and advocate RCV too, but we much rather mindlessly go 'TEAM BLUE OR TEAM RED' instead. Neither the Republican or Democratic parties want RCV, though, because it would squash their holds on voting power in the US. Both parties want you to be compliant, pick a side, and just shut up. The true fact of the matter is that we have an 'illusion' of choice and that's all that it will be until real reform is done and we have parties and candidates that represent more than just the far right and whatever the democrats feel like running as that current cycle.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"While usually I would agree, as an outsider (European) I would say that those elections are clearly NOT the ones to try to overturn the two party system.

As a leftist in European standards (for reference, I consider Bernie Sanders to be a centre-left to leftist politician), believe that Kamala would not be my first, second, or third option if I could vote. But despite that, I would vote for her, without any doubt. Because every vote matters. Because you are choosing between her or an autocrat. Because we know what Trump is going to do if he is president. Because you need to stop this madness, once and for all. Right now, we all can lose much more than 4 years of a republican government. We can lose an ally in the geopolitical struggle against autocracies, we can lose the fight to prevent the worst effects against global warming, we can lose the war against the fake news. We can lose the war in Ukraine or a determent against a Chinese war in Taiwan, or conflicts in the Korean Sea. We can lose the credibility of the most influential democracy in the world.

So, please, every vote matters. Every vote against Trump must be under Kamala. Because every vote against freedom, justice and democracy will be under Trump.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"I began parting company with the Democratic party under B Clinton.  But Bush promised to slash red tape, deregulate, continue the wonders of Reaganomics, and look what happened.  Reaganomics is single handedly responsible for the giant wealth transfer from the working/middle class to the billionaire/investor class.  I agree with you about Glass-Steagall, plus, honestly, a majority of Americans bought the bullshit, or close to a majority in the case of Bush/Gore.

It is not unfair to hold the Republican party accountable for their platform over the prior 40 years.  As far as giving people homes, they got them short term, then the banks got bailed out.  A lot of people were just literally destroyed, so they could live in a fancier house.

I think the most damaging thing in the 90's was the change in the patent laws, which occurred under Clinton and made r & d much less profitable in the United States.  If we want an advancing tech sector, they need to be able to make their research actually pay when it does hit.

However I like Harris so far, she's pragmatic, and I really like the Biden/Harris medicare reforms, and there is much more room there for cost savings and better outcomes for beneficiaries.

"I thank you for proving my point. 

The two party system exists mainly because we allow it to exist.  More importantly, voting third-party is about much more than winning or losing; it is about expanding the platform of minority parties and independent candidates. That's what Democracy is. Having more choice and say. Not less. 

If all of Jo Jorgensen's votes went to Trump in 2020, it wouldn't have made a difference, and Biden still would have won. 

You live in Illinois? Say a voter there votes for Chase Oliver. According to 538 and the most available polling, Harris is leading Trump in that state 58 to 42 percent. 


Please explain to me how a vote for any third party in Illnois is a 'vote for Donald Trump' when Harris is automatically gonna win that state? Newsflash: it isn't.

A vote for Trump in IL, CT or *insert blue state here* is even more of a 'wasted vote' than a third party. In same regard a vote for Harris in Oklahoma or Mississippi is a 'wasted vote' because she has zero shot to win those states.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúallowing it to exist‚Äù, it‚Äôs about a collective action problem that will necessarily result in it existing. If we want to solve the collective action problem, we need to change our electoral system to something like ranked choice voting. Our current system requires voters to think strategically.

Any ‚Äúexpanded platform‚Äù for third parties will necessarily come at the cost of established parties, resulting in a split vote. Say I vote for noted grifter Jill Stein: I would be helping to split the Democratic vote in my state, which would necessarily benefit Republicans in my state. I‚Äôm lucky that my state is solid blue, but *the last thing I would want to do* is enable a left-oriented third party (by American standards) to gain traction for runs in other, more competitive states.


So by your logic, if I voted for Trump, I wouldn‚Äôt be helping Trump win Illinois because he was just gonna lose anyway? That‚Äôs absurd.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"Respectfully, this is a talking point based on the experience that in my country the vote division on the left and the concentration in the right led to more right -winged governments that I would like, despite more people voted for left-leaning parties.

Like it or not, Trump is a threat to democracy, and this is not an issue to take it lightly. You are not going to accomplish anything dividing the anti Trump vote. Because, even if you achieve this 5%, those votes would be votes lost (or not won) by Kamala. This will increase Trump margin. And, I hope not to be correct, but under a Trump victory, I would worry more about avoiding to implement a one party system than to implement a three/four/N party system.

And this is not a talking point. This worry was not under Bush Jr., Bush Sr. or Reagan. This election is different. The worry here is not to win or lose an election. Is to win or lose democracy. And, respectfully, failing to understand that is a disservice you make to the democracy you say you want to protect",2024_11_06,05_05_54
Delegitimize the vote by abstaining or vote for a third party.,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"You can call it absurd, but it's a reality.  The only reason this reality exists as it is, is because we have the Electoral College. Under that model, your vote only matters if you live in one of a handful of states. That's harsh to say but it's fundamentally true. If you live in a decided state your vote does matter, but more so within the down ballot races. As it stands now, a vote in Illnois is different than a vote in Pennsylvania.  It's in my opinion, absurd to think otherwise. 

We as Americans have every right to change this in our country. We simply choose not to. To be fair however, ranked choice voting has been implemented in states like Alaska and Maine and both states seem to like its implementation where it's been more than not, a success.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"This worry was 100 percent seen under Bush. Rightfully so, Bush was a war criminal whose administration bombed and invaded not one but two wrong countries after the horrific 9/11 attacks. 

As a European, it should give you pause that under the Biden/Harris administration, the Taliban are selling weapons we purposely left in the Middle East during the withdrawal of Afghanistan. 

It should give you pause that the same Kamala Harris who tries to talk like a progressive is in bed with Blackrock. 

https://nypost.com/2021/01/08/kamala-harris-top-economic-advisor-is-another-blackrock-exec/

Blackrock BTW is the same investment firm that is actively buying up single family homes. 

It also should give you great pause that under the Biden/Harris administration, deportations were on track to be higher than the first term of Trump. 

https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ELECTION/MIGRATION-DEPORTATIONS/akpeoeoerpr/

https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/biden-on-track-to-exceed-trump-obama-in-deportations-in-first-term-data-shows

If you think either candidate isn't a threat to immigrants, you are strongly mistaken. 

The reason why Harris has been attracting a lot of billionaires and disenfranchised Republicans is because she's not gonna govern like a progressive, she is going to govern like a Bush era Republican. Both are oppressive choices. I respectfully think both spit in the face of democracy.

Harris has an oppressive record as a prosecutor, where during this time, she cost the city of California millions of dollars, convicting a man who was not guilty of the crime he was accused of

She has also used prisoners as 'cheap labor' 

https://www.kqed.org/news/12000397/what-9-cases-from-kamala-harris-past-say-about-her-record-as-a-california-prosecutor

This person, is a terrible choice to be president. Simple as that. Nor, to be frank do I think she cares about the every day person she pretends to care about. Just because Donald Trump is monstrous does not mean someone else who undeniably has an equally horrifying record means she is 'less horrifying'.

"So... the tale of Elon Musk goes back before most people knew his name, and after daddy's mine money.

Musk was one of the core people at PayPal back in the late 90s, and he had a vision -- he wanted to make ""the everything app"" and call it X.  Does this sound a little familiar?

He was fully convinced that he was right, and kept pushing the company to do it his way.  But he always wanted to use a stack that *could not possibly work* in that day and age, and would have been a total rewrite of basically everything.  Does this sound a little familiar?

So he effectively staged a coup within PayPal while someone was on their honeymoon.  He started *forcing* his changes.  Does this sound a little familiar?

He got kicked out of the company.  He was effectively given a ""fuck off fee"".  They wanted him gone so badly *they paid him to leave*.

He is still trying, nearly 30 years later, to prove that he was right all along.  He needs to prove that they were the dumb ones, that he was the smart one.

"Because it suppresses the vote.  If the US removed the two party registration, making everyone ""Undeclared"" or just nothing, make the day a national holiday so it gives everyone the opportunity and also everyone is automatically registered to vote at 18 then I think we'd be better off.

EDIT:  This response took off.  Later we discuss that making it a holiday isn't enough.  Making sure proper protection is in place to allow for workers that have to work be it hospitals, food service, fire/police, 24 hour IT positions.  Feel free to correct me further, but the employee protection now only says that if you're working while polls are open that employers have to allow you to vote.  Leaving an 8 hour shift to vote might not be covered by all slimy employers if you had the opportunity to vote prior to or after said shift.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"I know it's a popular idea but having a federal holiday for Election Day would not really benefit the lower income workers and the working poor, who happen to be the people most likely to need a little help getting their votes in.  Middle class, white collar workers would cast their votes early -- either by mail, early in person, or just stupidly early in the morning on Election Day -- then hit the shopping malls, bars, or restaurants, while retail, hospitality and gig workers had business as usual. 

Better suggestions would be federal minimums on drop boxes and polling places per 10k residents; federal minimums on in-person polling hours on weekends, late nights and early mornings; longer periods of early voting; and same-day registration.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

If I didn't have to work today, I would have used a vacation day yesterday and taken a nice 4-day weekend trip somewhere, so I'd be less likely to vote.

"Answer: Republicans have blocked every attempt to move voting day to the weekend or declare it a national holiday.

Why would they do that?

While Republicans have a very loud and enthusiastic voting bloc, they have very unpopular stances on most issues and rarely produce any specific plans other tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations. On other issues, they offer only grievances and vague claims to ""fix"" them without saying how (see Trump's ""concepts of a plan"" after 10 years of attacking and trying to kill the ACA).

Because their platform is unpopular to people who understand and pay attention to the issues, they get support by creating culture wars and outrage by spinning isolated incidents into full-blown nation-wide disasters that will destroy families and threaten safety (see trans people using restrooms or the powerful Christian majority somehow being constantly under threat and ""forced"" to attack religious freedom for all other religions so that they can survive), and calling their opponents scary buzzwords that don't even mean what the Republican base thinks they mean (communist, Marxist, socialist, etc.) and are not remotely true of the people they label with their name-calling.

But even with the rabid base they earn from these culture wars, they're still in the minority. So they use every tool in their disposal to limit the vote, throw out votes, and select their voters. The more voters there are, the less likely Republicans will win. That's why mid-term elections without the presidential vote on the ballot often rewards Republicans because many people don't bother voting in those ""less important"" elections‚Äîbut the rabid Republicans would never miss a vote. Most importantly, it comes down to Republicans choosing their voters by gerrymandering districts (cutting them into crazy shapes so that they'll mathematically reduce Democratic votes into fewer districts‚Äîa state with 10 districts where Democrats soundly win the popular vote will often fall to Republican control anyway by numbers like 7-3 because of gerrymandering. And then the electoral college gives extraordinary power to rural communities and low population states, making the overall popular vote irrelevant to who actually wins the presidency. For example, when a voter in the densely populated state of California votes, that vote has something like 1/50 the power of someone who lives in a cabin in the woods of Montana. The GOP then uses all of these advantages that got them in power to keep those advantages in place: they protect their ""right"" to gerrymander and choose their voters, they insist on keeping the electoral college to cancel out the popular vote, they want the filibuster to suppress the voter's desires once in office, and they appoint partisan judges to lock in unpopular partisan positions as the law of the land, and they block legislative votes from even taking place on things majority (sometimes in 90% range) desperately want... like a national holiday for voting, sensible gun laws, immigration reform (so they can use it as an outrage issue), etc.

Why don't the voters get angry and turn on the Republicans for all of this manipulation? Well, because the media on the right paints an entirely different reality from the one we all live in that propels all of those concocted outrages into the mainstream conversations. The media outlets in the middle fear being called biased so much, they both-sides every argument even when one side is not operating in good faith... and it gives credibility to the craziness on the far right as if it could be real. And then the people on the left trying to herd people back to reality are labeled far left extremists and soundly ignored‚Äîexcept for the ones already sitting inside their bubble. So, no matter how far the right drifts away from reality, the media follows them into their fever dreams making them seem real... which in a way, kind of makes them real simply because that's how they're perceived.

But the vast majority of Americans‚Äîwhen asked about the issues without party identification‚Äîagree on most everything. So it benefits Republicans to keep information low so their faithful don't realize how their policies hurt them, and keep their loyal followers turning out by hammering them with a barrage of disinformation and outrage‚Äîwhile keeping Democratic turn-out low by creating helplessness and apathy over the lack of knowledge on the other side and the impotence of actual facts.

However, if Democrats get fired up and show up, Republicans will lose every time. So they want voting to be hard, they want to choose who gets to vote, and they want to dictate how they vote.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

So making election day a holiday would really just incentivize those at the bottom that need representation the most, to go to work instead of vote, and incentivizes businesses to hold sales due to the increased traffic because higher wage workers do tend to have holidays off.

If you force all companies to close on that day (even if you except emergency services), that means hundreds of people are going to lose a full day's pay - if you're living paycheck to paycheck, that's a significant loss.

Instead, why does voting have to happen on a single day? Why not make the first week of Nov ""national voting week"" and have polls open for the entire period, so people can vote when they have the free time, rather than forcing free time into their schedule. or, make the deadline a certain day, but allow people to vote any day - April 15th is ""Tax day"", but I can pay my taxes on Jan 1 if I want.

"You do realize that only US citizens (and noncitizen employees of DHS for some reason) can even get SSNs, right? Like, it's not difficult for the government to validate citizenship if they're doing their job.

When I do my taxes in Canada, I check a box that says ""please share my details with the Elections Canada"". The government checks their own data to make sure I'm a citizen.

When I arrive at the voting station, I show my ID and the person at the desk checks that against their list of voters assigned to that polling station.

If I die, someone filling out my taxes make a mark noting that I'm dead and they don't check the box to give my details to the Election board. If I move, I put my new address on my tax forms, and I check the box. The voter information card is sent to my new address automatically.

Now, if I move before I can do that, that's about the only time that things get hairy. But even then I can still vote by mail for my previous riding. Yes, I'd have to wait until filing my taxes again to be able to vote in my new riding, but, again, it's all done automatically.

Get back in line and hope they don't recognize you the second time you come through as somebody different? It might work for a few individuals, but organizing something like that to get thousands of votes ain't going to happen and combine this lack of payoff with a huge penalty if you're caught. Nope.

When you get a driver's license, almost every state offers you the option to register to vote at the same time. When you file your taxes, there's often an option to be sent info on registering to vote.

Other than driver's licenses, the government (state and federal) doesn't really have a database of where everyone lives. Even then, many people don't have driver's licenses, and many often don't update their DL when they move to a new address (although you're supposed to). Your address on tax returns is only updated when you file, and there's not really a way to change your address between annual filings.

> WASHINGTON - More than two dozen states have indicated they would be willing to send National Guard troops to Washington if requested in the weeks following the presidential election and in the runup to the inauguration, Guard officials said Monday.

> Jean Paul Laurenceau, chief of future operations for the National Guard Bureau, said it is not yet clear how many Guard troops will be needed or requested this year.

> In the days afterward, Guard forces poured into the city by the busload. In 2021, a few states declined to send troops, also worried about violence within their own borders and capitals.

These guardsmen are not even saying they are planning to do so. The misleading headline is to blame, though, so I guess it‚Äôs not your fault. Damn media. 

I get the concern you‚Äôre pointing out, but a situation like that is highly unlikely. What they actually said in the statement the article references is that they would be *willing to go*, if they are requested to that is. 

Presumably, that means if they are officially ordered to, if the current president or any of his subordinates think it‚Äôs necessary. Trump is not president and is no longer part of the military command structure. 

These statements are being made by many other agencies too, as a cover. They are making a clear statement now, in advance, that they are not gonna play games this year with people who break the law in protest of the election, not at all.

- the federal and military will react. Bad press shooting a red neck wearing a buffalo hat, not so much poor optics for spilling the brains of a 45 year old dentist with an m16 in a rogue military unit.

- no real chance of military going rogue. As a soldier, you might like Trump (who knows why) but a) everyone in your unit in it, b) knowing you will be courtmartialed and shot, c) knowing the majority of your own friends won‚Äôt cross that line, and d) going against the constitution are a lot of logistic and emotional barriers.

"There‚Äôs actually a frighteningly possible angle they‚Äôll take. States are supposed to have their electors in by Dec 11 and they‚Äôre supposed to have voted by Dec 25. From my understanding the house can simply choose to not extend that deadline. That combined with republican governors and state legislatures in blue voting states intentionally delaying their electors leaves the door open to those states not being allowed to submit their votes at all. The house can then argue (to probably the Supreme Court) that actually the total required is not 50%+1 of 538 but 50%+1 of the electoral votes of the states that have been accepted by the house, naturally leading to a Trump victory.

Honestly active practicing of religion is falling in the military as it is in the civilian world.

Edit: I probably should add. That article was about the Airforce Academy and its Christian religious practices amongst the students. They hyped it up as some weird cult because at the time there was interest in the zeitgeist of a Christian Nationalist takeover of the military. I‚Äôll tell you something, a training base‚Äôs religious facilities are often packed because recruits are in a new environment, may feel lost, disconnected, culture shocked, or just straight up trying to find solace away from the training cadre and their superiors.

To elaborate on my overall thoughts, providing Kamala wins, I believe we'll learn everything we need to know about what kind of presidency she'll have based on tonight, through Jan 6th (and until ""someone"" conceeds the election). I'm 35 and I don't have a single memory of Dems ever putting together such a well rounded campaign.

For me, the campaign felt measured, coordinated, and thorough. If the Kamala/Walz team hasn't been faking it, then my assumption is that we're in for some pleasant surprises from them in response to whatever shenanigans come to light.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"There's a simple solution to fixing the distrust and political division in the USA, and that's to hold Fox News responsible for the toxic bile they spew on tv on a daily basis.

Fox News is currently *the* Number 1 most watched channel on American television, and they have basically free reign to spew bullshit from a fire hose all day every day with *zero* repercussion. They can sane-wash the ramblings of Trump while playing small flubs from democrats on repeat, and vilify them in their opinion pieces, and there's nothing anyone can reasonably do against it.

Dominion and Smartmatic sued Fox News for defamation, and while the Smartmatic suit is ongoing, Fox News settled with Dominion out of court for almost 800 million dollars, and Tucker Carlson got fired in the process, so at least they've been proven not to be invincible.

Without Fox News as their primary source of (mis)information, conservative leaning people will no longer get a warped view of the world they live in. Fox News would be *required* to give them real news, and not hit pieces and opinion pieces masquerading as news stories. Buffoons like Jesse Waters and Sean Hannity should get reprimanded for misleading or outright false statements, and the network should be fined heavily for each deliberately false piece they air without proper fact checking.

The Fairness Doctrine that Reagan axed in the 80s (because of course it was Reagan, it's always Reagan), would ensure that Broadcast networks gave equal time to opposing viewpoints, but on the other hand, ""equal time"" is a bit of a double edged sword, because there is no point to have a NASA scientist and the local moon-landing-denier share equal air time simply because it is required. So I'm not sure the Fairness Doctrine is the right solution, but a new piece of legislation designed for more modern times would be a good idea to implement.

Apply it to all news networks equally, and you'll probably find that it will hit conservative leaning networks harder, because they simply don't fact check to the same degree as more liberal-leaning networks.

So yeah. Hold Fox News to the fire, and you'll see a paradigm shift in the overall political discourse. It's the carcass that's poisoning the well, so take it out and let the water quality improve, and people will stop getting sick all the time.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

There should be much self-loathing experienced by anyone supporting this traitor.,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"They were the ones who signed on to help him **after** J6 2020, **after** he *refused to give back extremely sensitive top secret documents that were and are the property of the US Government by* ***law****,* **after** he concocted the idea of banding together fake electors, **after** he was found civilly liable for *$450,000,000 + $81,000,000* over **tax fraud and the Carroll case, after** Trump was found *guilty for having* ***illicitly interfered in his own election*** and so on and so on and so on.

They should be disgusted with themselves. Though, I guess it doesn't matter too much since:

1. Their thoughts on anything just...don't matter. They aren't people who are worth acknowledging the existing of (let alone doing something really stupid such as talking to them whatsoever).
2. We're disgusted at them *for* them. It's literally just like 2nd hand and 3rd hand embarrassment. We're disgusted for them and we know, due to everything written at the top of this comment, that what ***they*** think of themselves (or even what they think of others) just shouldn't be factored in to anything. Theirs is an opinion not desired by anyone who matters and whose ability to vocalize their ""wants and desires"" is akin to that of listening to a belt sander for 24 hours straight.

Vote around these fuck sticks and they won't have a say in it. If Harris/Walz win, it's going to cause the Republican party to go through its own personal Armageddon. 

Trump will NOT want to dip out of the spotlight. It's everything he dreams of. He wants the constant attention no matter what the attention is for. He also wants to ""plausibly"" (no) use ""waaah I'm running for President in 2028 so you can't finish your **criminal trials on me**"" and their party is going to go through **hell and back as a result.** 

He will have lost two Presidential elections in a row, helped to make sure the Republicans lost drastically in each midterm ever since his 1 win in 2016 and he is inevitably going to further drag the spike into the Republican party after ***he loses***.

THIS is what Graham meant when he said Trump would destroy the GOP.

It's because he knew the Republican party leadership would simply allow it to happen. Not that Trump was some ""brilliant demolitionist"". It's because Graham knew what we all know:

Republicans don't vote for and don't want actual Democracy and as a result, the first one to truly ""test the waters"" came away with flying colors.....from the voter base. 

That then stung themselves with very disappointing midterm results each time ever since Trump win in 2016. Their party is going to suffer catastrophic failures after Trump loses this time and I'm pretty sure that's going to start the beginning of the end of the party. Will likely take quite a while before it finalizes, but make no mistake it'll be the start of the end. Their party can't afford to suffer this many loses across this many political fields, unendingly while Trump stays alive.

Which is precisely what Trump is going to do.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

My guess what will actually happen once he's gone for good (read: the election is over, any lawsuits from him or against him are resolved, all sentencing is over, any sort of reelection campaign is over, etc), then there will be a sort of collective amnesia and the GOP will revert back to roughly their Bush/Obama era selves. They'll be like, ""Trump? Trump who? ***I*** never voted for the guy"" or something to that effect. 

The usual GOP policies, however, will continue on after Trump. There are plenty of other people in various positions outside of Trump. You have the majority conservative Supreme Court, you still have plenty of shameless GOP senators/governors, and you still have The Federalist Society. 

I think the one way that the Republican party could ""collapse"" would be if one of the other currently existing ""Independent"" parties gained a massive surge in public membership/endorsement by traditional GOP members, put forth competitive candidates in state level elections, and put forward a competitive candidate in the election after Trump is a fuzzy memory.

Numerous books, including ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"", detail the political/business enablers who helped Hitler rise to power.  Like today, they were helping for their own reasons.  Hitler was going to be their tool to accomplish their goals.

Paul von Hindenburg, President of Germany, didn't favor Hitler, but was talked into making him Chancellor, as a way of controlling radical elements, breaking the deadlock in Parliment.

Alfred Hugenberg was a media tycoon who wanted to jump on the bandwagon of Hitlers populist, mass appeal, and increase his own influence in many areas.

Many rich businessmen/industrialists saw Hitler as a tool to suppress leftist & labor movements, thinking Hitler would strengthen their economy and improve stability.  

Once Hitler gained power in 1933, he out-maneuvered them all.  He changed the rules of government that centralized much more power with him, allowing him to rule by decree & bypass parliment.  That was one of the big destabilizing moves that allowed him to sideline, imprison, or purge anyone who stood in his way.

Sound familiar?  Yet here we are, attempting to repeat history, to change government, do mass Fed Government firings (he expects thousands) & replace them with loyalists to centralize power/control, and a supreme court that already granted Trump immunity.

"From the WXIA-TV article:

""Over 4 million ballots were cast during early voting, with more than half of Georgia‚Äôs 7.2 million registered voters already participating. An additional 1 million votes are expected by the time polls close, marking another significant turnout for the Peach State.

Raffensperger, speaking at a press conference, emphasized efforts to enhance voter security and speed in reporting. Raffensperger noted that voters have experienced short wait times, with average check-in times under a minute. 

""It‚Äôs been smooth sailing by and large,"" he said. ‚ÄúAverage line time in Georgia right now is two minutes.""

According to Senate Bill 189, which mandates reporting early and absentee ballots within one hour after polls close at 7 p.m., nearly all early votes should be in by 8 p.m., Raffensperger said. Smaller counties aim to finalize counts by 10:30 p.m., positioning Georgia to have a clearer election outcome than in past cycles.""",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"If I'm understanding correctly, when polls close, we're already going to have those 4 million early and mail in votes pretty much counted. If we're seeing a big gap there, it's not unlikely that gap will remain due to such a high percentage of people having already voted.

"As a European, I can‚Äôt vote in the U.S. elections, but I can tell you this: your vote matters more than you might think, not just for America, but for the whole world. Here‚Äôs why:

1.	‚Å†‚Å†Global Impact: U.S. decisions on climate change, international trade, and global security affect everyone. Your vote influences policies that ripple far beyond American borders.
2.	‚Å†‚Å†Stand Up for Democratic Values: Voting is a powerful way to shape and protect democracy. In a world facing challenges to freedom and rights, every voice for fair representation matters.
3.	‚Å†‚Å†Address Shared Issues: From healthcare and education to climate action, many of the issues at stake in the U.S. elections are universal. Your vote impacts progress on these critical fronts.

Feel good about it. Our voting system is hardened against fuckery.

Ballots are electronically counted on two sets of randomly assigned machines (the touchscreens that print ballots, and the scanners that securely store ballots) with human readable ballots in the middle. The electronic totals can be trusted, but are still audited post-hoc by hand counts anyway.

">They are not allowed to count any early votes or absentee ballots until after the polls close tonight, but they are allowed to count votes today as they happen.

Imagine passing the law for this and thinking to yourself ""yeah this makes sense""",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"Correction, they don't count votes as they happen in PA.

Through the day runners will come through to drop off supplies and get ""point"" reports about how many voters have voted based on the log maintained by the clerk at the polling site, making sure it lines up with the count of the machines. The log number should match the number across the machines. No one knows who voted for what at that point, just how many people have voted.

At the end of the night, at the polling place after voting concludes, each machine will print out multiple reports with the tallied results, one gets filed with the county, one with the state, one is posted publicly, and one is sent home with the minority inspector of elections (minority inspector is usually required to be from the opposite party as the judge of elections). Every report is signed off on by both inspectors, the judge, clerk, and all present machine operators.

Then the minority inspector and judge of elections take those reports, as well as the USB/media backing them up, as well as all ballots, to the county seat for tabulation, together (same vehicle if possible) to prevent tampering.

The county seat is where the counting actually happens and elected observers are present.

Is that right? Someone just told me the opposite. They're allowed to start counting mailed in ballots as of when the polls opened. They announced they should have early numbers for mail-in ballots around 8 pm but don't predict day-of ballot counts until midnight.,2024_11_06,05_05_54
Same with Wisconsin. Unless Harris flips a few states I don't see how we'll have an outcome this evening.,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"FWIW, even with the law preventing the counting of mail-in ballots before the polls close, almost every Pennsylvania county-level election board is expecting to have results tallied and reported sometime tonight.  Philadelphia county is the lone exception to that, which is honestly not even that upsetting, since Philly County has 1.5 million people in it, whereas fully half of PA's 67 counties don't even have 1.5 million total people in them *combined*.  It's a dense damned county.

However, that one county is significant: without it, we likely can't be sure of the winner.  So PA probably won't be called until Philadelphia County is almost fully counted.  I think the only thing that will allow for an early calling of Pennsylvania is if there is a clear blue shift in non-Philly metro counties from 2020 to 2024.  If ""within 1% of dead even"" regions like the Pittsburgh and Harrisburg metro areas suddenly are definitively voting for Harris, then the state is absolutely overall going for her.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Pennsylvania only had 1.8 million early votes out of the around 7 million they will get.  So it will be quicker to count them.

But those voters are roughly 60% Democratic votes so there should be around a 350k Democrat advantage in early votes.  

My point is that the in-person votes will look like a Republican advantage again and then the early votes will start closing the gap.

So buckle up for Pennsylvania.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"the polling is inconsistent and it's only the polling that shows a red tilt to michigan, and I have yet to hear a single explanation for the catalyst. It's a blue state that BARELY went trump due to lack of voter enthusiasm; why would it suddenly go red when there's high democratic enthusiasm this go around? 

There's a clear chart of voter shar total going back to 2000: GWB lost with 1.9m votes, lost again with 2.3m, McCain lost with just over 2m, Romney at 2.1m, Trump won with LESS VOTES THAN GWB GOT 8 years before that. Hilary was 11k behind.

Then 2020, Trump is at 2.6m, the first statistically large republican voter count in 2 decades, and Biden showed up with 2.8m.

In what world does Trump increase above 2.6m or Harris drop below it? 

We'll see michigan go 2.7m for Trump as his ceiling and HOPEFULLY 2.9m+ to harris. Women outpaced early voting by 10 points. Harris' support is 53 to 42 among women.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Further, Trump is losing women over 65 by a lot. They spent a chunk of their youth trying to claw away rights from the patriarchy, only to watch the GOP and Trump steal the fruits of their hard work/sacrifice away. They're rightly pissed off.

Bush won Florida by 900 votes initially. Upon recount, he still won but only by 317 votes. A hand recount was ordered for 4 specific counties, as allowed by law. Specifically Gore requested a manual recount of 62,000 ballots where no presidential candidate was selected due to the ""hanging chads."" 

The Florida Secretary of State certified that Bush had won the election before the recounts were completed. Gore sued the Secretary of State and the Florida Supreme Court sided with Gore, allowing the recounts to finish. Bush appealed to the US Supreme Court and they immediately halted the recount. 

So not quite as clear cut as you portray it. A huge study concluded that Gore probably would have lost if they had completed the 4 county recount but probably would have won if they had done a statewide recount of untallied ballots.

"Female turnout in the US election is set to be high, according to early exit polls that could prove to be a boost for Kamala Harris.

Early data shows women accounting for some 53 per cent of the vote, six points ahead of men, and one point up on the last election.

In another possible boost for Harris, voters think the state of democracy is the most important issue at this election

Ms Harris has¬†put abortion and¬†the threat to democracy posed by Donald Trump at the centre of her campaign.

The exit polls showed 35 per cent of voters say the future of democracy in the US is a top concern, ahead of the economy (31 per cent), abortion (18 per cent) immigration (14 per cent).

Millions of voters across the US have flocked to polling stations with reports of record turnout in a number of states, including key battlegrounds such as Georgia and North Carolina.

"> Exit polls are conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool on behalf of a consortium of media companies: CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC. They get their name because interviewers on Election Day are stationed outside roughly 500 polling locations throughout the country, where they conduct surveys with a randomly selected sample of voters who‚Äôve just cast their ballots. The polling locations were themselves selected through random sampling, meaning the resulting interviews should be representative of Election Day voters across the state or nationally. The interviewers call back to report their results several times throughout the day ‚Äì which means that the early numbers will likely change as more data comes in.

So this isn't X% of ""voters"" but of ""people surveyed"" and, more importantly, ""people who answered the survey."" So the accuracy of these numbers applied to the general electorate depends on how closely those surveyed align with people voting and whether they answered (and told the truth when they did).

So there's a lot that can go wrong relying upon exit polling and even if it's accurate the numbers (30% democracy and 18% abortion rights) aren't particularly reassuring. It should be a blowout. The fact it's not a blowout is a huge problem, imo.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Two factors:

1) Trump had a ""how bad could it be""/political 'outsider' thing in 2016. We ALL know exactly what he is now. A decided known-quantity. And he's only gotten worse since then.


2) Hillary was by FAR the most unimpressive candidate I've ever seen, 2nd only to John Kerry in 2004. Had massive amounts of baggage, a complacent campaign that wasted time trying to run up the score and failed on fundamentals, and had the Comey October Surprise of reopening the ""buttery males"" thing days before the election (which then ended up as a nothingburger).

It's been attested that Hillary was the only candidate that Trump could beat, and I firmly agree with that sentiment.


My vibe-check is it's somewhere between 2008 and 2020. I've gone through some DEEP RED Trump areas recently, and the enthusiasm just... isn't there.

Kamala doesn't have the Clinton name as baggage, but she does have Biden's presidency weighing her down.

"I do think if he was the general election candidate in 2016 and conservatives got to listen to him in debates and town halls, they would have voted for him.

People would have voted for the old white guy who was grumpy about big money interests and passionate about wanting to improve living conditions over the old white guy who was a braggart about his riches and full of hate in every speech.

Bernie‚Äôs message was exactly what the country needed to hear. If people heard Bernie talking about how we are all brothers and sisters and that a nation is judged by how we treat the most vulnerable folks among us, the country would have come together more instead of splitting further apart.

Bernie was saying at his rallies and news appearances that ‚ÄúI care about your children as I hope you care about mine‚Äù and that elderly people shouldn‚Äôt have to cut their medicine in half to make the prescription last until they could afford a refill, and that he is sick and tired of seeing unarmed black men being shot.

Gallup polls consistently show that 40% of voters identify as independent compared to 30% who identify as Democrat and 30% as Republican. As an Independent, Bernie was able to bring people in to the Democratic Party that didn‚Äôt consider themselves Democrats. As a general election candidate he would have grown the party beyond its base.

Bernie was absolutely filling giant stadiums and arenas - and the environment was electric as he talked about what could be if we had leadership that put people before profits.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Anyway even if Trump takes Iowa, I just love that it is this close BECAUSE of *women*.

Trump and the GOP have just done everything in their power to make live a literal living hell for women in America, and it would be pretty sweet to have a woman defeat them and a woman bring back some sanity to our healthcare for women and our reproductive rights and again democracy is pretty cool (as a Lebanese, I don't know democracy, but as an American I'll literally die first before I give it up.

"If you check out the BBC production ""Trump the Criminal Conspiracy Case"" they make it very clear that Trump has a persistent problem with witness intimidation that has been repeated so many times it is hard to believe he's not already in prison. It's a good watch and it's hard to come away from it with the impression that anything less than prison would be a suitable outcome for a guy who treats witness tampering as a personal right. This is not something that happened once or twice, the guy has a hit team of professional witness intimidators who are proud of what they do. Every one of those fuckers should be doing time.

What you are reminded of in that documentary is that many of these goons have already plead guilty. It makes it hard to pretend nothing happend when most of your former lawyers have plead guilty to criminal charges. In several instances, these sociopaths are proud of themselves and seem to attach their identities to their role as Trump enforcers. That's cult-like behavior and those people are a danger to themselves and those around them. 

John Eastman. . . well watch the video and find out who that is if the name does not ring a bell. The man is a monster at the heart of the conspiracy and he's still free for now. You can be certain that man is a sociopath.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

No, not a miracle, and it's somewhat insulting and irritating to frame it in that particular way.

THe other side spent a lot on very successfully presenting him as a total failure, as a weak old man, and somehow the worst president we ever had as the best possible option. Kamala Harris was the deep exhale dems needed, and even in the first days clever analysts pointed out the unstoppable momentum of a deeply relieved electorate. Changes have clearly been made, a younger guard has been handed the reins of the DNC, and they absolutely smashed this out of the park - brilliant strategy, seizing on that need for change, and goddamnit Kamala Harris makes me feel like Obama did - smart, human, reassuring as hell, with a running mate who only stoked the fire. It's not a miracle, it's a razor sharp strategy.

Order the Primaries by voter turnout.  The greater the turnout the earlier a state is allowed to hold a primary.  Greater turnout equals a more engaged electorate, demonstrating that a state deserves earlier priority.  It also encourages voter turnout both for self interested reasons and applies a negative stimulus to states with low turnout.

For example Primary Voters in Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia would have to wait to be last.  Something which might actually encourage lawmakers to increase turnout.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Elections should be default wins for Dems until Republicans pull hard back to the left. That they aren‚Äôt shows just how incompetent they are with messaging. Obama cooked everyone.

That's also coincidentally when the messaging room a hard turn toward the ""safer"" option. They stopped using ""Were not going back"" and completely distanced themselves from the ""They're Weird"" messaging which I thought was a bad choice. I would have preferred for her to keep up that same direction and also more radically distance herself from Biden. She was too protective of him the entire campaign. 

My guess is that at the DNC, the old guard came in and started advising her to run a campaign more like Bidens 2020 campaign which did not work as well for her. If she ran a more aggressive campaign or ran a more ""it's time for change"" campaign like Obamas 2008 campaign, I think she'd be way farther ahead.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Also: we do need to give credit to Hillary. Like Obama she was a trailblazer who planted the seed that having a female president was not only possible, but ultimately inevitable. And on that angle, the one thing about her I‚Äôm so thankful for: she didn‚Äôt highlight her gender as part of her campaign, glass-ceiling and what not.

I don‚Äôt think that was as critical for Harris because most people just needed a sane, qualified candidate. If she were running against a more normal person, policy would have been a bigger focus. And that might take longer (look at all the people that kept saying they didn‚Äôt understand her policies).",2024_11_06,05_05_54
"I'm more than willing to be corrected, but as I see the Prime Minister election is more similar to electing the Speaker of the House which is usually a boring rubber stamp because the party leadership is consistent (like we already know who will probably be th Speaker in January for both parties). 

Congressional elections are already much shorter and less expensive (and happen every 2 years). (Even with the primary step. My state votes in the presidential primary months before the primaries for all other offices.)",2024_11_06,05_05_54

I really feel like Biden always had a backup plan in case he needed to step down and made sure he was a shield against right wing attacks for her.

"I disagree. Up until I would say the minutes leading up to his announcement, I am convinced Biden had 100% of an intention of serving another four years as President. It didn't just show in his campaign and their desperate moves to rebound post-debate, it showed in his demeanor, his voice, everything he was doing told me, ""I *want* this. I want to keep being your President.""

The very notion that this was somehow planned out from the beginning feels like Monday-Morning Quarterbacking to the nth degree. The entire Dem Party was preparing for the worst, for Biden to take his campaign all the way to election day, but instead he swallowed his pride and stepped down. Not only did he do it early enough that the party was able to then take the critical steps of solidifying behind Harris, but it was all still while he was probably still in his heart hurting from admitting that he was no longer up to the task of leading this country. I don't think anyone else in his position could have accepted it as graciously as he did.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

There are literally whole teams for politicians that consider the public perception and best course of action.

The amount of division between people has become so large some people view everything through a political lens. 

Short of avoiding people with conflicting views entirely which means trimming down your friend and family group by half so you exist in an echo chamber (a problem of its own), politics are inescapable.

"I'd wager that that's exactly the same sentiment as it's been with Biden. Neither of them wants this war to continue. To claim otherwise is tinfoil-hatted at best, outright malicious most of the time.

The issue at hand is: It's bloody complicated to actually make happen - particularly when the leader in charge of one side is banking on the political opponent's return to power to get a blank cheque to escalate the crisis further while turning a blind eye to whatever violations happen in the future. 

And on the other side you have a terrorist organization backed by enemy nations, while one of them is actively conducting a war and trying to do what it can not only to interfere with the ongoing election and destabilize not just the US but the West as a whole, the other nation being led by religious zealots who will never acknowledge the right of the other side's people to even exist, period.

I *wish* this utter shitshow was over, had never even escalated to this point, but this is *not* something that the USA can simply *decide* to end - it's a process that the current administration - alongside other big nations' leaders - has been pursuing for the past year and longer. A process which has been sabotaged time and again by new events and decisions outside of the administration's control taking place and exacerbating the situation time and again.

Which is to say: I firmly trust that Kamala Harris will do her utmost to bring this all-around humanitarian tragedy to an end. I do not believe she will sit idly by and let this shit continue. 

And hopefully, once she wins the presidency and gets into power, she will be able to put proper pressure on the ones responsible without it directly benefitting the other candidate who has made it abundantly clear that he would rather see Gaza razed to the ground with indiscriminate slaughter than actually strive for a stable, peaceful solution to an age-old conflict in the region.

I know Kamala Harris will do her best to move things in the right direction. It might not be enough, who can say, but the effort will be genuine.

">Maybe it's because the US funds Apartheid Israel

US also funds Yemen ($1.3B) and Syria ($800M) compared to Israel's $3.3B. So yes, the US does fund those 2 countries as well. Yet no one cares about their conflict. Almost like there aren't Jews involved in those conflicts. 

Also, nice propaganda you threw in there with Apartheid Israel. The only democracy in Middle East, the only one where the minority (Arabs) are afforded equal rights is the Apartheid country unlike those other bastions of human rights like Syria and Yemen where being a Jew is a crime and where being a homosexual gets you thrown off roofs and from helicopters. 

>Apartheid Israel is an occupier killing civilians on an incomparable scale.

Israel bought the lands fair and square from their owners, then fought a defensive war started by its antisemitic foes and then occupied land which those aggressors lost. It then pulled out of Gaza in 2005, let Gazans rule themselves for a decade and a half and all that got them was the worst terrorist massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. 

The true occupiers are the anti Semitic Arabs that cannot tolerate to have those 'dirty Jews' occupy any land that themselves once colonized. The snowflakes that start a war and then complain about the consequences of defeat. The literal Nazi scum that think Hitler was only 66% successful in his mission.

>Let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel‚Äôs right to defend itself, and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the war that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7, including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival.

>At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.

This does not center the rhetoric on the suffering of Gazans. We hear more about Hamas did October 7th and how it‚Äôs actually a good thing that Israel is defending itself (ie, using a terrorist attack as an excuse to commit human rights violations next door, and then later on managing to spark a regional war with the rest of its neighbors) than we do about the suffering of Palestinians. All we get for that is that they‚Äôre starving and scared, even though, by the point Kamala had made this speech, Israel was already bombing their hospitals, stopping aid and bombing independent aid workers, and the crossing of Biden‚Äôs supposed red line with the invasion of Rafah (which they crossed and then he proceeded to do nothing on anyway).

If you don‚Äôt understand why this might not be good enough for Arab-Americans who she needs to convince to go vote for her, then I do not know what to tell you. She made it clear over and over again that she was not budging on the issue, deviating an inch from Biden, who is already unpopular for his approach, all the way up until the very end where she finally changed her rhetoric to focus more on the Palestinian victims of the war.

Again, if she cared about Arab voters, she would have let a Palestinian-American speaker have a few minutes at the DNC. She gave a spot for an Israeli-American to talk, and it would not have cost them PR points to set up a few minutes for someone directly impacted by the war to be able to speak. The Undecided delegation even said they sent the DNC a copy of their speech to vet over for inflammatory language or anything that goes against the state‚Äôs foreign policy on the matter and the DNC still wouldn‚Äôt work with them.

If I was an Arab-American who is looking at the current administration  potentially helping bomb the shit out of my friends and neighbors overseas, and the official position has not been kind toward them, I‚Äôm capable and empathetic enough to sit in their shoes to see why Kamala changing her rhetoric right now after seeing Trump trying to court Muslims might ring hollow to them.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"We have no way to know what leverage is being exerted. Public pressure is undoubtedly only a small subset of our levers and one that probably blows a lot of other options

People act like we can just turn off supporting Israel and the war will stop. US aid is only 15% of Israel's defense budget, and Netenyahu is only the current leader of a whole nation of civilians who have been our ally for decades and are getting rockets and terror attacks launched at their civilians regularly.

There is no unilateral way for the US to just end the conflict, only various levers of limited influence, and it's way easier for me to believe that people who know a lot more about this and work on it every day have good reason to believe that cutting off aid doesn't put us in a better position to minimize suffering than that democratic leaders are indifferent to civilian suffering",2024_11_06,05_05_54

You do know the US isn't the only one involved in everything you listed.  There are a host of EU and other countries doing exactly the same.  If the US were to withdraw all weapons tomorrow, literally nothing would change except the number of defensive weapons Israel can use to protect itself from Iranian missile strikes would drop considerably and a small fraction of offensive weapons wouldn't be used.  If the US did that, they would lose all the negotiating leverage they have to pursue peace talks, and so far at the US is the only one who's been able to secure prisoner exchanges and temporary cease fires.

The only leverage USA has over those countries is that USA can go to war and kill them. Why is North Korea sending troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine? Why is Iran funding proxy militias to conduct terror campaigns all over the middle east?

Because *what the fuck are you gonna do about it*? Sanction them? They're already maximally sanctioned.  If you take away your child's phone, you ground them, you cancel Christmas, where are you going to go from there? You are out of options for discipline unless you want to start beating your child. And your child knows you would never hit them. Geopolitics is no different.

"Did Hamas or Hezbollah go far enough to assassinate members of the Israeli Knesset?

Furthermore, if you want to start arguing about what has been happening since Oct 7th, you could make an argument about Israel subjugating the people of Palestine to inhumane living conditions way before Oct 7th. It‚Äôs not like history suddenly began for them that day.

">You cut off at an interesting place.

I cut it off because when I googled ‚ÄúKamala Harris DNC transcript‚Äù, the top 3 sources included a NYT article I was paywalled out of, a PBS article that did include a PDF transcript, which I had trouble copy and pasting in its entirety on mobile, and an article on CNN that only transcribed the part about Israel up to where I was able to copy and paste on my post.

By all means, if you want to copy and paste the exact excerpt she said in its entirety, I‚Äôm very happy to talk and break down all like 3 or 4 paragraphs (depending on how they choose to transcribe it) in its entirety. I went through it and made sure anything I said wasn‚Äôt going to contradict anything I wasn‚Äôt able to include.

>She also broke with previous rhetoric and said they needed to work so ‚ÄúPalestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self determination.‚Äù  That‚Äôs more than the USA has said in the past.  She also notably snubbed Bibi.  All this back when, not now.

This is the standard neoliberal rhetoric when a Democrat talks about foreign policy. No matter which nation it chooses to talk about, it will *always* include a portion of ‚ÄúWe believe in X‚Äôs right to self determination and liberty‚Äù or something to that effect. It‚Äôs not like we entered the Middle East in the early 2000‚Äôs promising to bring freedom into the region for people who deserved to live in peace and prosperity.

That portion is meaningless. If Kamala had said anything to the effect of ‚ÄúI do not care one way or the other what happens to Palestinians because we side with Israel‚Äù to ‚ÄúPalestinians are all terrorists who deserve what they‚Äôre getting‚Äù, she would come across as so unlikeable toward even the general uninformed voter that just wants the fighting to stop so they can move on with their lives without having to hear people like me complaining about the issue, that she would inevitably turn them away. 

I don‚Äôt believe Trump gives any more of a shit, but he‚Äôs unable to successfully respond with ‚Äúkill them all‚Äù without turning off normies who are indifferent irl.

>She can‚Äôt come out against Biden‚Äôs foreign policy, she is a serving VP.  

I believe she could deviate from his policy when she was already pushing back against Biden before she started running when no one was paying attention to her before she reeled it back in once she stepped into the campaign.

>Do I think she‚Äôll do a complete 180?  No.  But she‚Äôll be different.

I don‚Äôt think the majority pro-Palestinian voters are asking her to do a complete 180, if only for the sake of optics. They are, however, asking her to deviate, like, at least 20 degrees away from Biden, which she has shown she is unwilling to do until this very moment when it became convenient for her.

And I don‚Äôt believe that she would deviate from the Biden position if she did take office. I do not believe she skew any further left in general than she has been, but I especially doubt she would suddenly change her mind on something she was adamantly committed gambling her election about. The Israel lobby has its pockets so ridiculously deep within both parties that AIPAC was capable of unseating Ilhan Omar. They have massive amounts of influence within both parties that I expect nothing less than a uniparty approach regarding their allegiance to Israel.

>And I expect people to vote their conscious, but to remember how Trump dealt with muslims, and Isreal, while president.  Put asside what he‚Äôs said campaigning, which is vile and possibly criminal, but what he did.  He moved the embassy, against State‚Äôs wishes, to Jerusalem.  He explicitly does not respect the land or claim of Palestinians.

I‚Äôm not claiming Trump is any better for them. I‚Äôm not claiming that I support Trump in any way. I personally already voted for Kamala and believe that if you are a leftist or an Arab-American that cares about Palestine in this election, you have no real choice between the only two real options that are genocide merchants (with Trump doubling as a genocidaire back at home), that all you get is an option for harm reduction and nothing more, and you should vote for the least harmful option available. 

However, my comment was not about what I believe people should do. I am just analyzing why people might choose to not believe her on this slightly changed stance she‚Äôs taken up 2 days out from an election when a lot of them already probably voted anyway.

"This is a wild overestimation of how easy it is to get more weapons without the US. 

For one, there are only a few countries that can provide Israel with weapons at the scale they need: Russia and China being the big ones. 

Russia is wholly aligned with Iran, so that's not happening. China is very similar, getting 90% of its oil imports from Iran. Additionally, China is very wary of global interventionist policy, and likely also sees that funding/arming the opposing proxy against Russia is against its regional interests. 

Europe could try to ship more weapons, but countries within are increasingly facing legal challenges regarding trade and arms exports at the national and EU level.

Edit: This keeps swinging between positive and negative upvotes, but I challenge any downvoters to really look at this issue impartially. There are no large weapons producers that are willing to give weapons (outside the US).

Buildings, by contrast, do not maneuver, tend to be stationary, and a small warhead is unlikely to deal much damage to them.

So yes? But after an Israeli invasion and months of bombing Lebanon. Correct me if I'm wrong but I haven't seen any other attacks in northern Israel? That would be the lack of trying. As Israel escalates so should everyone else. 

Like, you can't punch someone in the face and then get mad when they hit back. You might say well Hezbollah has been launching rockets all year! But up until last week, it was at Occupied territory and Israel bombed Beirut. So Israel certainly escalated. 

>And you take a terrorist organization at their word? The attacks were indiscriminate and you're buying into blatant Iranian propaganda.

Yes. Just as you side with the other terrorist organization, Israel. I listened to the words they said about the attack and looked at the results after. They all matched. They said they weren't after civilians, attacked, and didn't kill any. So yes, looking at the evidence, it's not just their word. 

On the flip side, Israel has blown up every hospital in Gaza and blew up entire apartment buildings for one guy in Beirut. While claiming they are ""saving"" civilians. So... One is actually trying to kill civilians - and succeeding and the other is actively trying not to kill civilians - and succeeding.

He's - amongst Rodgers, and Steve Irwin - the reason I continue to keep the safety of our planet in the forefront of my mind when it comes to why I ever vote.

I believe that is why Nye focuses on the young vote. Data says young eligible voters are typically more progressive. This year 41 Million members of Gen Z are eligible to vote. The highest turnout ever for the youth vote was 28% in 2020 before dropping to 23% in 2022. If even half of those 41 million eligible members of Gen Z cast a vote it would likely give the Democratic Party both chambers.,2024_11_06,05_05_54
"I'm not a nihilist, and I think voting is important.

"Here's his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UIzsPIrZdc)

Here's the original speech written by the Twilight Zone writer Rod Sterling he performed up on stage with MLKJr. 

Like he said, ""1964‚Äîa lot‚Äôs happened, not so much as Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed of, but it‚Äôs a start.""

> Ladies and gentlemen, this may be the most non-political speech you ever hear. And, indeed, if you look for controversy, what I‚Äôm about to say conjures up little conflict.
> 
> We have reached a moment in time when restless men, dispossessed men, angry and impatient men, and anguished men look up and reach out for an elusive justice oft promised them, long denied them, but in the eyes of God and man‚Äôs conscience is their due and should be their expectation. I say this is non-political and non-controversial. We‚Äôre not talking now about miscegenation. Or whether a man can fence his yard. Or a hotdog vendor carefully select his customer. Or an innkeeper choose not to accommodate a particular traveler. These are the ramifications of the problem. They are not the problem. There have to be some bridges built; but first we have to acknowledge the rivers.
> 
> 
> This is what I think is basic. This is what I believe to be the most common denominator in this spring of 1964. This must be first, the recognition and then the admission ‚Äî that the dignity of human beings is not negotiable. The eminent worth of man has no pro and no con. And the desperate need for an understanding and a respect between all men is as fundamental as the process of breathing in and breathing out.
> 
> On this spring night we look toward Washington, D.C., and hear the the echoed overtones of a debate. We watch the struggle to invoke a cloture. We hear the voices of the willful foot-draggers and the hopeful sprinters as they trade and compromise and give battle for what they believe. But again, there is something happening on this earth transcendent of the Senates, the governments, the temporal voices of the champions of rights and the filibusters of wrong.
> 
> What is happening is that a whole world has suddenly become cognizant of its oneness. An idea of brotherhood has ceased to be an abstract. It has taken on a form and dimension and breadth and meaning. ‚ÄúEvery man‚Äôs death diminishes me‚Äù ‚Äî a lyrical stab at truth from another century. But in this nineteen hundred and sixth fourth year of our Lord, every man‚Äôs indignity, every man‚Äôs hunger, every man‚Äôs search for freedom, every man‚Äôs life reinforces me and revitalizes me and rededicates me. ‚ÄúWe cannot be half-free and half-slave,‚Äù Mr. Lincoln said. And now, a hundred years later, we find that we cannot be half hungry and half content; half with dignity, half with shame; half with freedom, half with a simple yearning to be free; half with prerogatives, half asking for just a few; half superior, half denied the right to prove even equality.
> 
> 
> ‚ÄúYou cannot legislate human love.‚Äù Have you heard that phrase? ‚ÄúYou cannot pass a law to stop people from hating‚Äú ‚Äî a battle slogan of those who don‚Äôt want to be bothered. A statement of philosophy from 20th century non-philosophers who would probably melt down the test tubes used to look for the microbes and the bacteria and the virus that caused cancer. Cancer is with us, so why fight it? Leave it to the individual patients. But don‚Äôt make waves. Don‚Äôt stir the river bed. And above all, don‚Äôt contemplate the beauty of this earth. The deeds of love. The small, gradual, but inexorable move upward of the human animal toward an enlightened moment in time when the person next door is the neighbor, the Negro is the darker neighbor, the South American is my Latin neighbor, the Japanese is my Oriental neighbor.
> 
> You can‚Äôt legislate against prejudice? You would rather perhaps accept it as part of the innate personality of the homo sapien? You would rather say that it‚Äôs with us, it‚Äôs here to stay, it‚Äôs part of the social phenomenon of our time. If this is the premise to be lived with, accepted, and ‚Äî God help us ‚Äî embraced, then let us throw away theology. Let us unencumber ourselves of the premise of God. Let us tear up our art, our literature, all of our culture, and let us retire to a rubble of our own making and manufacture barbed wire instead of stained glass.
> 
> Hatred is not the norm. Prejudice is not the norm. Suspicion, dislike, jealousy, and scapegoating ‚Äî none of these things is the transcendent facet of the human personality. They are the diseases. They are the cancers of the soul. They are the infectious and contagious viruses that have bled humanity over the years. But because they have been and are, is it necessary that they shall be?
> 
> 
> I think not. If there is one voice left to say ‚Äúwelcome‚Äù to a stranger; if there is but one hand outstretched to say ‚Äúenter and share‚Äù; if there is but one mind remaining to think a thought of warmth and friendship, then there is also a future in which we will find more than one hand, more than one voice, and more than one mind dedicated to the cause of man‚Äôs equality.

> Wishful, hopeful, unassured, problematic, and not to be guaranteed. This is all true. But again, on this spring evening of 1964, a little of man‚Äôs awareness has shown itself. A little of his essential decency, his basic goodness, his preeminent dignity, has been made a matter of record. There will be moments of violence and expressions of hatred and an ugly re-echo of intolerance, but these are the clinging vestiges of a decayed past, not the harbingers of the better, cleaner future. To those who tell us that the inequality of the human animal is the necessary evil, we must respond by simply saying that first, it is evil but second, it is not necessary. We prove it, sitting here tonight. We prove it by reaffirming our faith. We prove it by having faith in our reaffirmations.

"I studied forensics and realized that almost no one is really cut out to be a criminal.  Being a good criminal means you have the skills to pursue almost any other career and be successful.  You almost have to choose crime for the sake of it. It takes a level of organization, compartmentalization, and above all, meticulousness that most people just don't have.  The government has a huge pool of resourses and expertise to draw from and most importantly for them, lots of man hours.

The only other way I could think of is to commit crimes sporadically, randomly, and arbitrarily.  The hardest ones to figure out are the ones with no motive.  Thankfully, those also seem to be the most rare.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

 If she only scrapes in it will have to suffice but a landslide should be the appropriate outcome in order to stifle any MAGA shenanigans such as claiming victory due to 'vote rigging' etc.

An overwhelming victory would take the wind out of the MAGA sails and hopefully reduce their mass psychosis. He can then arrive for sentencing in NYC and face the music in his other matters.

His family, noticeably absent in this campaign, are likely considering whether or not to rat him out to prosecutors in order to save their skins. 

His MAGA sycophants will be falling all over each other to back-stab themselves out of this shit show and it will be most amusing. Most of them will need to blank out their CV's of any involvement, such as 'overseas travel' etc if they want to work again.

> Over the course of the 2024 contest, Trump railed against undocumented immigrants, standing on a debate stage and falsely accusing Haitian migrants of stealing and eating their neighbors‚Äô cats and dogs. He mocked Biden for being old and mentally infirm, and he repeatedly mispronounced Harris‚Äôs name and insulted her intelligence. At times, he echoed rhetoric from Nazi Germany and, more recently, falsely declared himself ‚Äúthe father of IVF‚Äù and promised to protect women, ‚Äúwhether the women like it or not.‚Äù

> A week ago Sunday, at what was supposed to be his triumphant Madison Square Garden rally in a city that had never fully accepted him, Trump‚Äôs speech was overshadowed by a comedian who appeared before him and described Puerto Rico as ‚Äúa floating island of garbage.‚Äù Trump was livid, saying the comment ‚Äî and ensuing days of negative headlines ‚Äî was an unforced error in the final days, two people close to him said.

> Yet for much of the campaign, Trump offered a message of xenophobia and misogyny and racism, of cruelty and darkness and hate. If he wins, it will be because enough of the nation embraced that message, too. And if he loses, it will be because enough of the nation voted against that message ‚Äî and Trump himself.

-Called Nancy Pelosci and Michelle Obama a bitch.

-Felt the need to ensure everyone he had never read Mein Kamph. (It‚Äôs ok, we know Donald. We have tape of your best friend for 10 years Jeffery Epstein saying you are functionally illiterate.)

"The *only* topic he managed to touch on that had *any* meaning to actual voters is the immigration issue. To say that there remains a significant problem with illegal entry and illegal overstays isn't inherently wrong. This problem does exist, and even Harris' campaign  has acknowledged it. 

But Trump's problem was a) not mentioning that *he* was the reason Congress didn't pass the immigration bill that would have addressed this issue, and b) he chose to frame it as ""ALL those brown immigrants you see are evil dog-eating illegals and I'm going to DEPORT THEM ALL!!!1!"" which, I believe, alienated more voters than it gained.

In literally every other topic, he bombed spectacularly, or didn't address at all. He spent much of his time ""weaving"" stories about fictional serial killers or bitching about microphones. None of this was helpful, and none of this could have gained any more voters than turned out for him in 2020 when he was the incumbent.

I would agree he's cynically made no effort to put forward a platform. He has no ideas. He's lazily and impulsively taken to his podium and rambled aimlessly with low energy for months and months. His ramblings center on his own ego and id, as they always have. He's insulted and threatened people, public and private. He's disgraced himself, which has become all too normal and accepted for his campaigns. 

Worst in history. Yes. Somehow trumping his own ugly, deranged performances in the past. 

But you're giving her a little too much credit. Kamala has applied herself competently. She's avoided gaffes. She's pulled together policy agendas in relatively short time in reaction to being handed the baton mid-season. All that is commendable.

However, that's not the best campaign in history. You're getting carried away. 

Obama was quite a bit more effective at winning hearts and minds. He didn't have the benefit of his opponent being the most repugnant human being on earth. He hadn't been VP for 4 years. He was the underdog and rose meteorically because of his rhetorical skill, his agreeable, common sense and sensible persona, and a massively innovative campaign leveraging the internet (during the onset of Web 2.0 days) in unprecedented ways, basically writing a new playbook for every political campaign of the following 18 years. His team combined data science and grassroots mobilization and globally recognizable branding to get our first African American president elected. He was a fucking rock star.

Kamala hasn't come anywhere close to that. She's borrowed some of those moves, which have been refined over almost 2 decades, and she's wisely followed his lead in approaching controversial issues with caution and consideration. But she has barely broken through all the noise Trump creates. She's going to be a great President (assuming the country doesn't fuck this up) but she's largely being propelled by people's hatred of Trump because even though she has made the effort to explain what she stands for, most people don't feel like they've heard her.

"***From Rolling Stone‚Äôs Tim Dickinson:***

Chris Hood, the founder of the thuggish neo-Nazi group NSC-131, has endorsed the MAGA candidate for president, calling on fellow fascists in the swing states ‚Äúto vote for Donald Trump.‚Äù

In a long statement on Telegram, Hood described Trump as providing a small step forward to his goal of ‚Äúultimate victory,‚Äù and insisted that casting a ballot for Trump provides a no-regrets way for race separatists to act ‚Äî ‚Äúeven if it means just one less Somalian in Maine, one less Haitian in Ohio, and one more foot of wall built.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúIt costs you nothing.‚Äù

The embrace by the Trump movement by a literal neo-Nazi ‚Äî who was previously a member of the Proud Boys, Patriot Front, and another hate group called The Base ‚Äî offers evidence that Trump‚Äôs late, ugly, attempts to expand his appeal to the fetid fringe of the American right could have met with some success. The Trump campaign did not respond to Rolling Stone‚Äôs request for comment.

Based in New England, NSC-131 is infamous for dressing in black and conducting intimidating and sometimes violent flash-mobs. NSC-131 has often attempted to mainstream its hate by riding MAGA coattails ‚Äî targeting the same kinds of people in person that Trump blasts, rhetorically, in his stump speeches ‚Äî whether that means shouting down Drag Queen Story hours at public libraries, or harassing migrant workers housed at Boston-area hotels.

Hood writes that the neo-Nazis‚Äô long-term goals are not achievable quickly. ‚ÄúIn the meantime though, It is our responsibility to think clearly and do whatever we can to preserve and improve what we can in these times,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúBecause of this, I am advocating for all Nationalists in New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Virginia, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, North Carolina, and Michigan to vote for Donald Trump.‚Äù

"If I remember correctly, (don‚Äôt quote me) you have to notify the SEC at least 2 business days *before* selling shares, because you are considered ‚Äúinsiders‚Äù. This is specifically to prevent pump and dumps like the above commenters believe to be happening. Which from my investment experience, big wigs like directors and CEOs typically make big insider sales for tax purposes, not because they are getting out or the company is tanking. 

Contextually speaking, to add some validity to my case, you can actually check on [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/djt) to see the short interest for Trumps stock. Over an hour ago maybe around the time of the article, there were 0 shares available to short. What that means is, institutions borrowed every single share that was available to be borrowed, and sold them, because their outlook is that trump will lose the election resulting in his stock price crashing. So when they buy back the shares at a much lower price than when they sold, they pay what is owe and collect the difference. 

There is absolutely no fucking way in ANY parallel that trump is stupid enough to try and sell his shares the day of the election. He would have had to at the *LATEST*, inform the SEC on Friday, that he would be dumping shares today. Imagine if he fucking did that lmao.

So‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs kinda sorta not a thing‚Ä¶? Like, countries will sign extradition treaties or not. The US has extradition treaties with countries, but I cannot find examples of a non-extradition treaty between the US and another party. Countries that do not have an extradition treaty with the US can still extradite someone back to the US, but don‚Äôt have too.

I cannot find an example of two countries who signed an agreement (treaty) to not extradite each other‚Äôs citizens. I‚Äôll be happy to be corrected in this.

Anyways‚Ä¶ whatever country that holds him that doesn‚Äôt have an extradition treaty will certainly hold a lot of power and have a strong position to negotiate certain request. Say he lands in Venezuela, well that government can ask for some, if not all, sanctions to be lifted in exchange, otherwise, they‚Äôll turn over Trump to Russia, Iran, China, whoever will give them a better deal.",2024_11_06,05_05_54
Or maybe he can manipulate the orange man into letting him take Ukraine. Or maybe Russia already has a history of interfering with our elections and you should know better than to take anything Putin says as the truth.,2024_11_06,05_05_54

"I don't believe this. Not even a little. Not even a tiny little bit.

If he loses, he'll announce another re-election bid before the end of 2025. He'll pitch a fit, stomp his feet claiming fraud, and then he'll start holding rallies again.

If he wins, he'll start pushing for the end of term limits and start campaigning on that.

He's addicted to the cheers and adulations he gets from the rallies. Plus campaigning serves him 2 purposes 1) It helps to keep him out of jail, since he can make the argument that it's all political persecution. It won't save him forever, but it does help 2) Fundraising for his endless campaigns is about the only income he has these days.

Now, that's not to say it'll be a successful campaign. I don't think he can win the nomination if he's a 3 time popular vote and 2 time electoral vote loser, but that won't stop him from trying. He's going to campaign until he's dead, and it won't matter if he's in the White House or the Big House.

Editing to add: My tin foil conspiracy theory that I also believe is that he is a Russian asset and as long as he can cause disruption and chaos in the American electoral process, Putin will never let him walk away.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

2.	‚Å†Stand Up for Democratic Values: Voting is a powerful way to shape and protect democracy. In a world facing challenges to freedom and rights, every voice for fair representation matters.
3.	‚Å†Address Shared Issues: From healthcare and education to climate action, many of the issues at stake in the U.S. elections are universal. Your vote impacts progress on these critical fronts.

"Provide proof of the claim that you allege they are blind to. 

Here's a friendly reminder of how Trump's election fraud cases went for him last time around...  

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trumps-challenges-2020-election-unfolded-courtroom-rcna175490

> After Donald Trump claimed victory in the early-morning hours after election night in 2020, his campaign and supporters turned to the courts to make that claim a reality. The Trump campaign and surrogates began filing lawsuits the very same day, challenging the results on a variety of grounds well before the final votes were counted.
> 
> The legal process and tactics may provide insight into how Trump or his allies could launch similar efforts should he lose again this time.
> 
> Over the remainder of November and into December, Trump and his Republican allies filed dozens of lawsuits in key swing states that, if successful, would have given Trump the Electoral College votes needed to remain in the White House. Their efforts stretched from local county courts all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and were supported by solo practitioners and state attorneys general alike.
> 
> Of the more than 60 lawsuits filed in the post-election period, Trump obtained a favorable ruling in only one case ‚Äî the remainder were eventually either dismissed, settled or voluntarily withdrawn.  

Not to mention how poorly it went for his attorneys...  

https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/trump-lawyer-cases-show-2020-election-punishments-come-slowly 
 
> Here‚Äôs a rundown of some of the most notable cases state lawyer organizations and courts are pursuing:  
> 
> **Jeffrey Clark**
> 
> A DC Bar committee on April 4 preliminarily found Clark violated at least one ethics rule by lying about alleged election fraud. The panel will decide as early as next month before sending the matter to the Board on Professional Responsibility. The case then goes to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
> 
> The bar‚Äôs DC disciplinary counsel, Hamilton ‚ÄúPhil‚Äù Fox, is seeking Clark‚Äôs disbarment. The bar bodies and the appeals court could decide on lesser sanctions, such as a written warning.  
> 
> **John Eastman**
> 
> A California State Bar Court judge on March 27 said Eastman should be disbarred for knowingly making false statements that election irregularities cost Trump the 2020 race.
> 
> The bar court‚Äôs appellate division will review the finding, and the state‚Äôs highest court will ultimately decide. Eastman has said he could seek US Supreme Court review.
> 
> Though Eastman has yet to be disbarred, he is ineligible to practice law in California, according to his online law license. Eastman challenged his ‚Äúinactive‚Äù law license status on April 3. The State Bar argued on April 10 that Eastman needs to be sidelined because he has shown he is willing ‚Äúto misrepresent facts, violate the law, and pursue frivolous claims on behalf of clients.‚Äù  
> 
> **Rudy Giuliani**
> 
> New York‚Äôs Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in June 2021 temporarily suspended Giuliani‚Äôs law license for making false, misleading statements about the election. A Democratic state senator had filed a complaint with the state‚Äôs Attorney Grievance Committee, which sought the suspension.
> 
> The District of Columbia Court of Appeals followed, temporarily suspending Giuliani‚Äôs license in July 2021.
> 
> A DC Bar committee in July 2023 recommended Guliani‚Äôs disbarment for his failed election challenge in Pennsylvania. The bar‚Äôs Board on Professional Responsibility held a hearing in November. The board‚Äôs report could be issued at any time.
> 
> After the board makes its finding, the case goes to the DC Court of Appeals.  
> 
> **Sidney Powell**
> 
> The Michigan Attorney Grievance Commission in May 2023 filed a complaint claiming Powell and other lawyers brought frivolous election challenges in the state. A hearing panel of the Michigan Attorney Discipline Board in December rejected Powell‚Äôs arguments that the board lacks jurisdiction.
> 
> In 2021, a US district judge in Detroit fined Powell and other attorneys more than $175,000 in 2021 for wasting resources by filing a lawsuit to overturn the election result in Michigan. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit largely upheld the sanctions in 2023, and the US Supreme Court in February declined to hear a challenge of the appeals court decision.
> 
> In Texas, the Texas Commission for Lawyer Discipline last year said it is taking its ethics case against Powell to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas. A federal judge in Texas in February 2023 threw out discipline charges that alleged Powell had violated legal ethics rules. 
> 
> **Jenna Ellis**
> 
> In March 2023, a Colorado judge censured Ellis, who once said she was part of an ‚Äúelite strike force‚Äù fighting for Trump. The judge declined to disbar Ellis for her role in making 10 false claims about the 2020 election. 
> 
> **Kenneth Chesebro**
> 
> The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court as of March 13 temporarily suspended the law license of Chesebro, an architect, along with Eastman, of a plan to create elector slates in six states. Chesebro is also unable to practice law in California, at least on an interim basis, according to his state bar online record.  
> 
> **Julia Haller, Brandon Johnson, Lawrence Joseph**
> 
> In DC, The bar‚Äôs disciplinary counsel, Fox, on Jan. 9 filed claims against Haller, Johnson and Joseph.
> 
> He alleged that Haller and Johnson filed suits against election offices and officials in Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona seeking to overturn the election results. Fox claimed that Joseph, in a suit he filed in Texas against former Vice President Mike Pence, made claims about a ‚Äúcompeting slate‚Äù of electors in Arizona that ‚Äúhad no factual basis.‚Äù",2024_11_06,05_05_54

He issued two proclamations, in 1869 and 1876, calling for the dissolution of the Democratic and Republican parties.

He issued decrees calling for the construction of a bridge or tunnel to connect Oakland and San Francisco.¬†These decrees were prescient, as the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube were eventually built.¬†

""How can you betray your moral conscience?""

Some questions for your morals if you are a professing Christian:

Should marriage rights be put in the hands of somebody who has been unfaithful to multiple wives? With porn stars?

Should women's rights be put in the hands of somebody who is legally liable for rape and brags about his sexual assaults?

Should nuclear codes be put in the hands of somebody who cannot own a gun? Whose military generals almost unanimously describe him as a fascist?

Should border policies be put in the hands of somebody who uses openly racist rhetoric about Jews, Hispanics, Asians, African-Americans, and his political opponents?

If you can answer yes to any of these, please tell me, ***is your moral conscience intact?***

The response I've been given is that you are picking his policies over his moral character.

Another question for you, *what do you think he uses to make policy-related decisions?*

""But he will ban abortion!"" Why didn't he during his term? Should 66% of Americans that are professing Christians use religion to enforce political laws on the bodies, homes, families, and lives of the remaining 34%? In a free country that stands on the separation of Church and State?  So long as abortion remains a medical reality, and states' rights remain intact, do you actually think a nationwide ban is possible?

""But he was good for the economy!"" The economy that he inherited from Obama and tanked for short term numbers in the stock market?

""But he will crack down on LGBTQ+ presence in public schools!"" You're entitled to have a different lifestyle and worldview from LGBTQ+ children. But.... they are not entitled to think differently than you? Your plan for these children to see the love of Christ in the Gospel is to \*checks notes\* make them feel unsafe in their daily education?

"I'm a Christian. My wife is an ordained pastor.  I spent the better part of 10 years working for 'the church' in a few different ways. I went to seminary (but didn't finish with COVID and a job change). 

Conservative Christians buy into the 'war' imagery in the Bible. They are adversarial in nature and consider their faith journey to be one of adversity. Conservative Christian denominations are also the largest in the US - Evangelical Protestants being the bulk of them - making up roughly 25% of the US population. 

We often look to folks like Joel Osteen, but the truly despicable central figures were people like Oral Roberts - who promoted the Prosperity Gospel. The PG basically morality is tied to wealth. God gives wealth to good people, so the wealthy must therefore be moral, while the poor must therefor be amoral. 

So in the 80s and 90s when most of us were disgusted by fictional characters like Wall Street's Gordon Gekko - the people were quietly fetishizing having their own wealthy elite. 

Those of us in the real world recognize that no person can get that amount wealth without being highly unethical - think insider trading, ponzi schemes, etc. But because Conservatives equate wealth with morality, they see those failings as acceptable because they lead to a higher purpose - and if God gives you wealth, God must consider you to be okay. 

Meanwhile, the more liberal pockets of American Christians are busy feeding the poor, housing the homeless, etc. They see it as their mission to uplift their fellow humans and consider it important to live and play within the rules.

One of those rules (mostly unspoken) is that we don't discuss politics or religion in public. So these folks go to church, give to charity, do their thing, and go home. Quietly leading a life of faith as they see fit, without wanting to inadvertently impose it on anyone else. The most vocal and famous ever would be Jimmy Carter, and he got pretty beat down in the political spectrum after one term in the WH. But he played by the rules.

And he of course lost to Ronald Reagan. A Christi-racist himself, RR was a big proponent of Prosperity Gospel and ingrained in deeply into the law of the land. There's a reason he's still the poster-boy of the Right. 

So of course all of this to say, lots of Christians DO stand up to Trump. But we do it quietly, because that's the rule. You don't make a show of your religion, you don't make a show of your faith, you don't pick fights in public, etc.

"I've done plenty of Revelation studies.  The question that always comes up is ""How can the people follow the anti-Christ when they see what he does and how he hold himself?"" And then all of the Christians choose to follow Trump, despite his character and rhetoric.  This is how the people will follow the anti-Christ.

I am not a fan of the democrats' policies.  But I cannot support Trump.  The Christ that I follow says that character matters.  That how you hold yourself matters.  Do I like abortion?  No.  But I contend with the abortion issue it's more a ""Why do you want abortion?"" than to just widely cast a net and say all abortions are wrong.

Christians have made abortion too much of an issue that they fail to see any other issues.  When it comes time to follow a politician or a movement they ask the question ""What's your stance on abortion?"" and they follow whatever candidate says they are against abortion.  Other issues, character, and general moral compass do not matter!

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not stop racism in this country.  Banning abortion is not going to stop women from wanting to get an abortion.  If you really want to stop abortions (at least what I qualify as contraceptive abortions) you have to focus on the root cause.  Why are you wanting an abortion?  Did you have fun with someone and now regret the consequences of those actions?  What led you to believe you had to have that fun to begin with?

But to focus on those questions is harder to do than to just blindly oppose abortion and move to make ALL abortions illegal.  Being a Christian isn't always about taking the easy action - in fact it rarely is.

I weep so much for what these Christian followers of Trump are doing to the Christian movement.  How can we as Christians look to bring people to Christ when we follow someone with the character and moral flaws of Trump?  Worst yet, how can we bring people to Christ when so many Christian Trump followers are imitating the very mannerisms of Trump?

The Bible teaches us that we will know Christians by their fruits:  Love, Joy, Peace, Longsuffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Meekness, and Temperance (Galatians 5:22-23).  Which of these fruits does Trump - a man that says he doesn't need forgiveness because he's never done anything wrong - exhibit?  If you are a Christian, which of these fruits are you showing your fellow man?",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"The problem is that the GOP doesn't care about life either.  ""Pro-life"" was always a lie.  It's a scam used to trick people who don't think too hard.

Roe v. Wade was overturned, and there are MORE abortions now than there were when it was legal.  Is that what you wanted?  There have been hundreds of cases of women who had miscarriages, and instead of getting hospital care they get arrested for having abortions.  There have been women with non-viable pregnancies who died because the hospital can't treat them.

How do you pretend for five seconds that you care about life and vote to support the people who did all that?

If you're against abortion, there are lots of sensible things that could be done to reduce the number of abortions, starting with comprehensive sex education.  But the same people who say they are against abortions are also against actually teaching sex education to kids; they want to teach ""Abstinence-Only Education,"" which essentially means that they think the best thing is to keep children ignorant of their own bodies and how they work.

You know when you see people saying that Christians are immoral anti-science hypocrites?  Stuff like ""Abstinence-Only Education,"" voting for people who increase the number of abortions and get innocent women arrested and killed, and talking as if ""more abortions and more dead women"" is the only morally acceptable choice is WHY people say that.  Because it's true.

A public not being complacent about voting is a small advantage. It is far, far outweighed by the world having to endure years deep anxiety about if the most powerful country in the world, *the* archetype of a nuclear power, will continue hobbling along or tip into fascism. If you don't care to imagine the harm that does to American citizens, imagine how that feels for American allies. Imagine how that feels for Ukrainians who have to wait for the US to get its shit together every 4 years to know if we will help shield against Putin or turn our backs.

"I am on your side here but I keep trying to remind myself that this is not 2016 and VP Harris is not Secretary Clinton.

In 2016 Trump was an unknown quantity, politically speaking. It was impossible to predict just how chaotic and terrible his presidency would be simply because we‚Äôd never seen anything like it before. ‚ÄúDuring a pandemic he helped exacerbate, the president will deny the results of an election and order his supporters to storm the Capitol‚Äù would have sounded like bad thriller fiction in 2016.

In contrast, Clinton (who I voted for) was an incredibly well-known quantity, and a lot of people genuinely disliked her, in large part because the GOP had been demonizing her for literally decades. She may have been the most uniquely qualified person to hold the job of President in my lifetime, but she was a poor candidate/campaigner and took a lot of things for granted. Plus she was kind of the ultimate establishment figure, which can be (and was) a turnoff for certain voters, a fact which was made all the worse by Trump‚Äôs outsider status.

Harris has made none of the mistakes Clinton did- she‚Äôs been campaigning her ass off- and is not nearly so well-known and long-tenured a national political figure as to be instinctively disliked by undecideds or people who are wary of ‚Äúthe establishment.‚Äù And she is running against a version of Trump whose outsider appeal is gone, and who is in fact now all-too-familiar to many voters- he was a terrible President just four years ago, and has been an exhausting drain on the nation‚Äôs psyche in the four years since.

I share your concerns, I really do, and maybe I‚Äôm saying all this to reassure myself as anything else. But the situation now and the situation eight years ago are night and day different.

That was before J6 and before Trump doubled down on all the same, and in many cases, worse rhetoric that made the gap between 2016 and 2020 so large. I would be very surprised if Kamala doesn‚Äôt have Trump beat by well over 10m votes, if not 15m or 20m.

It's how his head of the Bureau of Land Management moved their HQ from DC to Colorado to be in the same building as Chevron and other energy companies. It's how Betsy De Vos becomes Sec. of Education in spite of having zero education experience. Its how Amy Coney Barrett becomes Supreme Court Justice with zero experience in a trial to verdict as either a lawyer or a judge. It's how the My Pillow guy ends up being head of our Covid response. Its how the America First PAC is going to write many of his policies for him. 

This is why he wants to be President. He auctions off every single thing he has access to. He makes millions while going golfing, sells premium seats at dinner tables next to him at Mar a Lago, sells access to classified documents, and gives cabinet appointments to the bidders willing to book a $5m/night stay at Mar a Lago. 

Every government agency could be run by the same people these agencies are supposed to be protecting us from. Trump doesn't think about that, and doesn't care, he just sees an opportunity to get richer.

Over the years I've grown to like the way they present things and fact check both sides and offer credit where it's due. I honestly would like to find some that are right leaning/center just to have more of a variety, but everything I've seen so far i just don't agree with. Either because they are giving people that spout bullshit a platform, they cherry pick things to cover, and or they have a toxic audience.

"Something that also never seems to be brought up is the fact that there are a lot of people who just truly HATED Hilary, even among Democrats. The Dems‚Äô leadership treated her as a sort of heir apparent the moment she was elected in NY without any thought to the fact that she carried a ton of baggage and acted like she was a complete shoe-in for the office when it came time. I mean, look at ‚Äò08 and how people went hard for Obama‚Äîa relative new-comer‚Äîover and against her. But the Dems consistently ignored this and kept pushing her. Was she a better choice than Trump? Absolutely. But she was a divisive figure and I knew several Democrats who didn‚Äôt like her and were not willing to go out and vote for her (plus, they also thought Trump was a joke and would never win). 

But Kamala feels different. It‚Äôs the closest to Obama back in ‚Äò08. It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúanti-Trump‚Äù but actual excitement over her as a candidate. Plus, now people know what a Trump presidency would be. If Joe Biden of all people could win in 2020, I feel pretty hopeful about Kamala. People are actually voting *for* her, not just in opposition to the GOP. And that‚Äôs great and even exciting.

You think the reason people oppose Trump is this kind of headline? Seriously?

There are more than enough reasons to oppose Trump just from *Trump in his own words* that you can hear for yourself, so long as you're not a fan of corruption and authoritarianism.


You can hear Trump for yourself echoing some of the vilest dehumanizing rhetoric in history by calling people ""vermin"" and ""not human"" and ""animals"" and saying they're ""poisoning our blood."" He says he didn't know that Hitler said that last one too. He wants you to know he's not *quoting* Hitler, just thinking along the same lines. 

You can hear Trump for yourself saying he wants to use the US military against ""the enemies from within,"" and identifying Pelosi and Schiff as examples. 

You can hear Trump for yourself on a recorded call pressuring the GA sec of state to ""find"" the exact number of votes he'd need to win by one vote, and suggesting that they could just say they ""recalculated."" Pressuring an elected official to commit fraud is a felony. He committed a felony on a recorded phone call. 

You can watch Trump for yourself on video making promises about a fake ""university,"" and you can watch him for yourself on video (under oath) admitting to all the elements of fraud. He settled because he was going to lose. It was a rich guy scamming working class folks, many of them for over $20k. 

All of which you can verify for yourself without trusting the mainstream media or anyone else, because you can hear him saying those things in his own words, with your own ears.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

He also suggested people inject themselves with bleach. 

He continuously contradicted and demeaned Dr. Faucis authority on the matter, and bolstered the entire anti-mask movement.

Not to mention he downplayed the presence of the virus in the US, and severity of the virus. He delayed proper preparation for it and it resulted in an unmitigated disaster.

> Bill Gates, a top election official from Maricopa county, Arizona, told the Guardian: &quot;Elon Musk has made a number of false claims about Maricopa county that I and other officials have responded to. Given that Musk has such a large platform it&#039;s of particular concern to us.""

> &quot;It now appears that Musk is using his wealth and ability to reach hundreds of millions of followers with lies and debunked conspiracy theories about how elections are being administered.&quot;Now that he has fully and openly embraced Trump, he has joined Trump and his other minions in spreading the claim that the only way Trump can lose the upcoming election is if there is widespread fraud.

> At the end of October, Musk told his followers to inform an &quot;Election Integrity Community&quot; on X about election problems, even though Musk&#039;s pro-Trump America Pac oversees the feed, which included some claims of election cheating that state officials in Pennsylvania and Arizona had debunked.

"In the years since we first heard all this bullshit about voter fraud from Trump, absolutely zero meaningful evidence has been published. In 2020, the only fraud found was republicans attempting to disenfranchise voters. Trump‚Äôs claims of evidence that he will reveal is such obvious bullshit because, if he had it, why on earth would he not have published it prior to the election? Why would he not submit it to evidence in his trials? This is the same ‚Äúgolden tablets‚Äù gambit that charlatans and con men have pulled for centuries. I have to imagine that for most people, the truth is obvious: the elections are not rigged, it is the GOP that is attempting to subvert democracy.

Inflation sucks but it's back down to target levels and wages have nearly matched inflation since 2019. Yes things cost more, yes people make more money. Most Democrats support our efforts helping Ukraine.

I don't think anybody was enthusiastic to vote for Joe Biden in 2020. Most people voted for him because they were tired of Trump. I'll admit I voted for him and didn't want him as president, though he has far surpassed my expectations.

But it's 2024, nuance is dead. If all you're thinking is ""stuff was better under Trump"" that probably looks like a much better option compared to Kamala's ""we're going to do basically the same thing for 4 more years.""

"> Decent people are different than the delicate balance of national security.

True. Also irrelevant.

> SpaceX is a leader in an insane amount of technologies that the state department are keen on keeping state side.

You packed a lot of bullshit into that sentence that you didn't understand.

The State Department is concerned with US diplomacy with other countries. It doesn't give a rat's ass about SpaceX. SpaceX isn't involved in interstate diplomacy. The only reason the State department *might* get involved with SpaceX is with the import of a satellite from another nation, but the US Customs Department's got all of that handled 99.999% of the time.

SpaceX being a leader of technologies is true, but the US is not even *slightly* worried about keeping it ""stateside."" If Elon Musk attempted to remove it from the state, for any reason, the US would not allow such a move. If he's threatened to, or sold SpaceX's secrets to a non-US state, he's probably violated US law on export restrictions of military industrial secrets - ITAR and similar laws prohibit the transfer of certain kinds of sensitive technology, including rocket engineering. 

I could go on, but really, what's the point. Two vacuous sentences shouldn't need as much reply to discredit, but, here we are.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Most employees are pretty heavily mismanaged too.

He‚Äôd also have to attend meetings with US teams even though he was based in the UK - this is normal in corps but it happened very frequently due to projects which should be with US ending up in UK due to bad project management/resource allocation.

It makes sense for these companies to hire as many people as they possibly can, as they literally have more money than sense, and even still it makes sense to keep competition at bay by keeping the best engineers in your own org. But it‚Äôs not very healthy for the market.

As an aside, this is also why Google churns through products then quickly abandon them - some talented engineer with nothing to do and a want for visibility would work on or create some new app/feature, gain internal clout from its initial success and move to a better role, at which point the product is dumped with a team who didn‚Äôt make it, don‚Äôt understand it and don‚Äôt care about it - it becomes unusable, then Google drops it due to low usage.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

Russia and China still depend on the US to be the world's policeman, when it comes to international trade. Russia has overstepped every reasonable boundary. Teach Russia a lesson, and China, at least, will learn from it.

"I think the point they're trying to make is that early turnout may be down slightly from 2020 due to excess deaths from covid.

The reason excess debts and covid is much different than the normal random people dying every day is because we can kind of predict approximately how many people die every year based on Trends and history. Covid was significant because there was a lot of excess that's over that expected trender line. That's why saying ""well lots of people die every year"" isn't really significant, because we already know that. COVID slowed population growth more than we'd normally expect because they were excess deaths over the normal, random deaths we see every year.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"Article:

Former President Obama on Tuesday urged the country to be patient as election workers count ballots to determine the results of the election.

‚ÄúIt took several days to count every ballot in 2020, and it‚Äôs very likely we won‚Äôt know the outcome tonight either,‚Äù Obama wrote on the social platform X.

Obama encouraged the public to ‚Äúkeep a few things in mind as you make your voice heard today.‚Äù

First, he said to remember that ‚Äúthousands of election workers around the country are working hard today,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúRespect them. Thank them.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt share things before checking your sources,‚Äù he added.

And finally, ‚ÄúLet the process run its course. It takes time to count every ballot.‚Äù

More than 82 million voters cast early ballots this year, which is slightly more than half the total turnout in the presidential election in 2020, according to The Associated Press.

States have different rules dictating when and how ballots must be counted. Some states have changed their rules since 2020, which could change the timing of when results come in.

In 2020, the race was not officially called for days after the election, leading experts to preemptively warn the public against expecting to know the results of the race on Tuesday night. Experts also warn that early poll returns do not necessarily indicate the trajectory of the entire election.

Vice President Harris and former President Trump are entering Election Day in what polls indicate could be the closest race in recent history.

According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling aggregate, Trump and Harris are tied nationally, with 48.4 percent support each.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

""The poll may easily turn out to be wrong; Selzer‚Äôs record is as good as anyone‚Äôs in the business, but it‚Äôs not perfect. Should Kamala Harris win this election, though, the poll will be part of the story of her victory. The reason for Selzer‚Äôs anomalous finding is simple: women. If it‚Äôs anywhere near accurate, it suggests that conventional political wisdom has been seriously underrating the scale of women‚Äôs fury over abortion bans and their revulsion at Trump‚Äôs cartoonishly macho campaign.""

Ballot drop boxes are everywhere in the city 2 weeks before you even get your mail in ballot.  Everyone gets a mail in ballot if you are registered 2-3 weeks before Nov 5th.  You can drop off at any of these drop boxes at any time.  So far as I can tell, they pick up from these boxes daily.  And my vote was counted right away.  There's even a text alert that tracks my ballot and tells me when it's been counted.

If you want to vote in person, you can do so Mon-Sat starting a week before Nov 5.  You can even go to any polling location and cast a provincial ballot if you're going to be out of town.  It'll get counted a bit later, but you'll still be able to vote.

I had time to research every candidate and measure from home.  I had no line, no stress, and cast my vote at my convenience.  Even had the sticker on the instructions so I could add it to my car window once I dropped it off.

from the article:

They just added an ID requirement here in NC. You had to state your name, address, etc to the clerk, then *physically* hand over your ID to the clerk so they could inspect it to determine if it was valid and legitimate and then they cross-referenced it with the information you stated.


It was clear that the clerks had been given very little training on any identity document besides drivers licenses, even though there was a list of about 10 different valid IDs you could use. I used my passport and I handed it to the clerk open to the identity page (as you would for presenting it at customs).

Edit: Also, your version of the events is a little bit wrong. People like me were watching the data feeds and we know that Biden won on election night. It just wasn't a ""statistically solid"" analysis. Simply put, there was reason to think the analysis we did could be wrong, so the media didn't cover it. They waited until there was multiple ""strong"" indicators before calling the election, which was a very good idea for them to be cautious. Getting something like that wrong is really bad.

">The 2020 election was not very close in hindsight. Biden won by a very significant margin.

From your link (emphasis added):

>If Biden's three narrowest state victories‚ÄîWisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona, all of which he won by less than a percentage point‚Äîhad gone to Trump, there would have been a tie of 269 electors for each candidate,[^(\[320\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-tippingpointstate-334)[^(\[321\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-Skelley-538-335)¬†causing a¬†[contingent election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_election)¬†to be decided by the House of Representatives, where Trump had the advantage. (Even though Democrats controlled the House, contingent elections are determined by state delegations in which each state receives just one vote, and since a slight majority of states in 2020 contained more Republican than Democratic representatives, Republicans would have had more votes in such an election.) **This scenario would have required a popular-vote shift of 0.63% or less in each of these three states, a total of about 43,000 votes, 0.03% of votes cast nationally.**

Due to the electoral college, the margin of victory was only 43k votes, or 0.03%. If you want to consider electoral college only as the margin of victory, you could theoretically win every single state/district by a single vote and have a complete clearing of all 538 electoral votes...while only sweeping the entire 100% of the electoral college while on a razor thin edge of a little over 50 people's ballots. 

If we want to consider popular vote only as the margin of victory, you can imagine a scenario where 100% of all people in every single blue state vote democrat and the republican wins every red state and those three states above by only tiny margins. Then you'd end up with the democrats winning the popular vote 65% to 35% and still losing the electoral college and thus the election.

While this system is in place, neither the electoral college margin nor the popular vote margin are a good representation of the margin of victory. I'm not sure why I see this revisionist history of it not being a close election in 2020 so rampant on reddit.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

>Obviously it's the electoral college that determines the result and it was 306 to 232, which is not very close. That's a significant margin like I said.

So your position is that an electoral vote win margin of 74 is significant, no? Then a 74 electoral vote margin of victory is always a significant margin of victory, no? Then hypotheticals are not irrelevant if that is how you have defined your words, it must be consistent and any hypothetical scenario where the margin of victory is 74 electoral votes should also be considered ""significant"". 

>You can't keep transfering back and forth between the popular vote counts and the electoral counts to make your talking point work

The popular votes in each state determines where the electoral votes of that state go. It is thus essential to consider the popular votes in certain states when looking at where the electoral vote margin landed. They are related.

If you agree that the popular votes in each states determines the electoral counts and that you have defined an electoral victory of 306-232 as ""significant, then let us imagine a hypothetical scenario that is far fetched but certainly not outside the realm of possibilities. 

California currently has 54 electoral votes. Can we not imagine a scenario that by the next census there's been a mass exodus of people from various red states to California, and the electoral votes have been redistributed away from those states and now California has 74 electoral votes. In 1964, California only had 32 electoral votes, so this isn't a crazy stretch. If California is the tipping point state, the winner of California will have won the electoral college by 74 points, 306-232, the same margin as Biden in 2020. By your definition, this would be considered a ""significant margin of victory"".

Now, the only place we disagree, is by the very virtue of your same logic in 2020, you are also saying that in this hypothetical scenario of someone winning the electoral college by 74 points, that it does not matter if that person won California by only a single vote (the popular vote margin in that state). I am saying that by my logic, winning California and thus those 74 electoral votes by only 1 single vote is an extremely thin margin of victory, regardless of how many electoral votes or popular nation wide votes that person has.

This has nothing to do with cherry picking data in hindsight. It is merely taking the logic by which you choose your words and applying that same logic to other scenarios and seeing if the conclusion is still logical. There's a reason there's an entire paragraph dedicated to this razor thin margin on that wikipedia article, and this was widely talked about at the time.

I posit that my hypothetical of winning California by 1 vote and still having the 74 electoral college margin vs the reality of those 43k votes across 3 states also having 74 electoral points are not such a huge difference when we're talking about 160 million votes. This is not some absurd cherry picking of data that some random person on reddit pulled out of thin air on hindsight, it was the entire backbone of Trumps illegal pressuring of vote fixing in those three states.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

The presidential election is not determined by the voters. It's determined by the electoral college. You keep mixing things up and now you're suggesting that I am illogical...

You're also aruging about what the word significant means now... Which is super silly because it doesn't really mean all that much. It just means a ""significant amount"" in whatever the context is. In your own example, a single vote could be considered ""significant"" if it led to the state being won.

I don't know what the point of this conversation is. I really don't.

"**From Hugh Dougherty, author of the article:**

Two of television‚Äôs biggest names broke through days of silence from their networks about the bombshell tapes revealed by the Daily Beast in which¬†[Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/jeffrey-epstein/)¬†speaks about his relationship with¬†[Donald Trump](https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/donald-j-trump/).

[Rachel Maddow](https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/rachel-maddow/)¬†on MSNBC and¬†[Jimmy Kimmel](https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/jimmy-kimmel/)¬†on ABC both spoke of their shock at the tapes, with the late-night host complaining that they had not been widely covered by other outlets.

On MSNBC, Maddow listed what she termed ‚ÄúOctober surprises,‚Äù comparing the tape to the revelation that Trump‚Äôs former chief of staff John Kelly and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, said¬†[Trump is a textbook fascist](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-is-a-hitler-loving-literal-fascist-says-ex-chief-of-staff/), and to the Iowa poll that put Harris¬†[three points ahead in the deep-red state](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-is-a-hitler-loving-literal-fascist-says-ex-chief-of-staff/).

On ABC, Kimmel, who is not bound by news standards, spoke freely about his shock at the recording and hinted at the silence that surrounded the Beast‚Äôs bombshell.

‚ÄúWe heard a bombshell audio tape in which Jeffrey Epstein says he was Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòclosest friend‚Äô and shares a bunch of crazy stories. This barely moves the needle,‚Äù Kimmel said. ‚ÄúRemember when¬†[Mitt Romney](https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/mitt-romney/)¬†went down because¬†[he put a dog carrier](https://www.thedailybeast.com/romney-dog-loved-trips-atop-car/)¬†on the roof of his car?

"As a lifelong Floridian, it pisses me off to no end that my right to access reproductive healthcare is contingent upon 60% of Floridians giving a shit. Absolutely maddening.

I'm also pissed that the marijuana amendment, as of now, has more support than the abortion amendment. Last poll I saw was 60% in favor for marijuana and 58% in favor (read: won't pass with less than 60%) for abortion rights. I'm in favor of recreational weed, don't get me wrong.

"I'll be honest the ad campaigns against ammendment 4 aren't helping.

A majority of the ads against ammendment 4 have been saying outright lies (the biggest ones being that the law would remove the ability for parents to know what is going on with their minor children, the other being about the definition of viability of a pregnancy).

Meanwhile the anti-ammendment 3 commercials I've seen have been like ""well I want legalized weed but I won't be able to grow it myself  :/"" - basically even the negative ads for ammendment 3 are still mentioning that they want weed legalized even if they don't like the wording of the current ammendment.

It's pretty easy to see where the divide is just based off how both ammendments are being talked about in ads. I'm still hoping we'll get the 60% needed for both but we definitely have an uphill battle. :/",2024_11_06,05_05_54

>But what the hell is wrong with the people of this state caring more about legal weed than bodily autonomy?

Honestly? Religion. 

My mid 90s year old Grandma in Alabama is super Catholic and very much against abortion. She believes the soul is created during conception. 

Luckily, she's smart and empathetic. So she's actually pro choice and liberal as fuck. She believes being a Catholic, she should consider what helps people and will benefit overall society. So while religion is the issue, is religious single issue voters, that are manipulated into voting against their own interests based on a single issue.",2024_11_06,05_05_54

"The laws are different from State to State but ballot initiatives can be added to general state elections to change or update the State constitution. These are called ""amendments"", and as they name implies it amends the Constitution. 

Each State has different thresholds and requirements to add an Amendment to the ballot. 

In Florida this year, there are 6 Amendments with the 2 big ones being voting to legalize weed and to protect abortion rights. Florida also requires a supermajority to pass Amendments, needing 60%+.

Half of the propositions put up by the legislature this election  are trying to take away our power to put up our own propositions. The other half are trying make judges positions permanent and other screwy things to take power away from the people.
