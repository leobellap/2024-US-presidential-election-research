"4-0 for Harris here.  My 92 yo FIL is sitting out this one....he voted Occupant 45 first cycle, but someone who was 12 years old, in Berlin, right after WW2, he has recognized  history repeating.....we are in NY so it's OK.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"My sister and I are both Gen X. Opposite sides. We both early voted. She wouldn‚Äôt stop going on and on about how Harris is wrong, Trump was right, etc. I told her that we‚Äôre not gonna talk politics. She kept going. I told her ‚Äúwell, your vote didn‚Äôt  count. I specifically cancelled out your Trump vote‚Äù. We have not talked in a week‚Ä¶.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
Both of my Gen Z kids (20 & 22) voted.  They did not cancel out my or my wife‚Äôs votes.  +4 for Kamala.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
Gen X here. Fortunately my Gen Z kid and I both voted for Harris. No need to cancel my vote,2024_11_04,06_23_09
"From one Gen Z person to another, listen up: 

Your vote matters. Why? Because politicians are more inclined to listen to those who vote than those who don‚Äôt. Who you vote for is private, but whether or not you vote is public. If we sit out this election, then our government will not listen to us. So, that‚Äôs why we need to step up and vote today, tomorrow, and Election Day. 

And to those who don‚Äôt want to vote for Harris and Walz because of Israel and Gaza, I know that what Israel, more specifically Netanyahu, is doing to the Palestinians is horrible and I hate how our government has not done enough to call out Netanyahu for his actions. But let‚Äôs be real, Trump is going to give Bibi *everything* he wants on a silver platter, including wiping out the Palestinian people. Do you honestly believe that letting Trump win the election is worth the cost of our country and the lives of the Palestinian people?

[Here‚Äôs a link to Bernie Sanders‚Äô take on the matter. I think that it‚Äôs important that you and I watch this in case we still have doubts.](https://youtu.be/Vf5MThSniiY)

On top of that, there are other issues on the ballot that are more important than anything in Gaza. Electoral reform, education, economics, healthcare, abortion, LGBTQ, climate change, etc. Those are the things that we need to focus on when we are voting on Tuesday. If Trump and Vance are elected, things will take a turn for the worse, and we and Gen Alpha will have to live with the consequences. 

So please, let‚Äôs stop wasting time and get out the vote!",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"The first time I voted  was in 2004. I went with my mom & dad. Mom asked who I picked on the way home. I said Kerry. She hit my dad‚Äôs arm and said ‚Äútold ya so!

The first election that I could vote in was 2012. Despite it being uncommon for people my age to vote, I did so.

But then when the 2014 midterms came about... I figured... it's not a presidential election, what's the point? So I did not vote in that one.

But I was wrong and voting is important. To this day, that is the ONLY election that I was able to vote in and didn't. And I deeply regret it, even now, a decade later.

Reminder that Donald Trump was found to be a sexual abuser by a jury of his peers in May 2023.

"I don't understand this either. I heard so many sad, and painful stories of my family's time in Cuba. How can they not see the blatant red flags that they taught me?

My mom was always republican, and even since I was a child, I was always liberal leaning.

I remember taking a political party quiz in school and how my mom paraded it around to my family. All of them laughing and bringing up communism.

I remember the Bush/Gore election and following it closely. My parents tuned in watching everything about it.

My classmates followed closely too. We were deep into climate change and we were so hard core Gore fans.

I remember the disappointment in my mom when she told me she voted Bush. She was proud and smug about it too.

It was years later when Obama was on the ticket and  things changed for my mom.

She said that she was tired of the republican party. She was disappointed in Bush and she really didn't like Romney.

That year, she voted for Obama. When his re-election came, I voted with her and Obama stayed in office.

Through all of it, my mom begged me not to tell our family of her betrayal. 

My mom sadly passed away a few years ago. However, I'm always proud of her for finally seeing things as they were and going against all odds. I'm sad she had to go during Trump's term. I'm glad she went before the insurrection, though. She never liked Trump. I was happy to vote Biden in, and I know she smiled down at me as I voted Harris this time.

Before anybody says it, yes, more people than just that group fled from Cuba, especially in the years after the initial rise. But regardless, many of the Cubans who fled to the US carried inherently conservative views with them as a result. They mainly voted for the Democrats because they were more in line with their interests as immigrants, but over the years this has started to shift, as it has for other Latino groups. In particular with Cubans, they've started to feel that various social programs are precursors or a run-up to another communist regime, thanks to plenty of mud-slinging today.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"There is a lawsuit in Pennsylvania regarding voters who failed to sign the correct date (or did not put any date) on the envelope which contains their mail ballot. 

Argument: the ballot cannot be received before the election authority prints it; the ballot will not be accepted after Election Day. Therefore, the written date is irrelevant. 

Counter-argument: the writing of the date is a critical element of voter intent and any deviation of one of the many required elements (inner envelope, outer envelope, voter written address, voter written date, voter signature, voter signature matches the voter signature on file as judged by a volunteer election official who may belong to a political party who knows the voter‚Äôs party affiliation, the envelopes are all correctly sealed, the ballots are marked with the correct ink color, the ballots are turned in with the proper time period. 

A second lawsuit regards the ‚Äòcorrection‚Äô if any error above. The federal Help America Vote Act allows voters to ‚Äòcure‚Äô any ballot defect by replacing it with a corrected one. This is because ballots are not counted until Election Day, and voters should be able to replace their older ballot with a ‚Äòprovisional ballot‚Äô. Provisional ballots are reserved and the election authority decides whether they can be counted or not. 

Republicans sued, arguing that any error cannot be fixed as the vote has already been cast - just not yet counted.

A third issue is there have been criminal cases of voters unsure about whether they can cast a vote, and casting a ‚Äòprovisional ballot‚Äô. In these cases, instead of the election authority deciding whether the ballot can be counted or not, the district attorney of that jurisdiction held the voter responsible for knowing whether their ballot would be counted or not. These voters went to jail.

"The water bit is ridiculous, but the history behind the concept is pretty interesting and goes back to our earliest elections. When the country was first founded, it was common practice to provide alcohol as an incentive to get people to vote.

Over time, providing an inconsistent reward for voting was viewed as a form of buying votes (to be fair, that was very much the point) so it was banned. 

In an ideal world, there shouldn‚Äôt be lines so long that forms of sustenance are required, but it should also be mandatory that polling places have water available for anyone in line.

"Read my lips: repealing Roe v. Wade is going to be their undoing.

It's not rocket science. For the past, I don't know, 10 years or so, we've been running somewhere around 48-52 and the only real shift was which party held the majority. The states that were gerrymandered had supermajorities, but at the Federal level things were close.

Repealing Roe is (I believe) going to push about 5%, maybe as high as 10%, towards the Democrats. My evidence is simple: Ohio, a red state by any measure, carried Issue 1 (2023) at 57% for. In 2022, JD Vance won Ohio at 53%. I think based on that, it's reasonable to say that in Ohio Issue 1 carried by 10% over its baseline.

I'm a Republican. I'm not these Republicans. They've lost their way, and this party needs to burn to the ground. The party of the Bull Moose it is not.

I'd also like to take a moment to acknowledge how fucking ridiculous Mike Johnson looks in his Trump Vance flight jacket.

"Or, now hear me out, this is pump meet dump. The election betting odds they are referring to are determined by ‚Äúprediction markets‚Äù such as Polymarket. According to Forbes:

> Prediction markets should work more or less like financial markets. Participants buy or sell financial instruments or contracts which Polymarket ‚Äì a leading Prediction Market ‚Äì refers to as ‚Äúshares.‚Äù Others have called them ‚Äúidea futures‚Äù or ‚Äúevent derivatives.‚Äù All of these terms are metaphorical. These contracts are really more like wagers that pay off based on a particular outcome. However, unlike most simple wagers, they are tradable, and are sometimes referred to as ‚Äúoptions‚Äù 

That means you can basically trade bets like you would futures options for pork bellies (pun intended). If you know about options trading (if you don‚Äôt, school up), options have an expiration date. On that date you should only still own an option if you need to buy or sell the underlying asset (ie the pork bellies, bushels of wheat, etc.).  There‚Äôs no underlying asset in the case of an election.

So if you want to make money you need to sell your futures contracts before the Election/Pay day. Bro trader in France pumped the options on trump, probably with the help of his supporters, and now needs to dump to make their payday come true.

To make those adjustments, they're essentially making a prediction about what will happen in the election, and other polls can help them make that prediction. So things get ""herded"" toward rhe consensus.

Selzer, I believe, still does tons of un-persin interviews, and the organization knows Iowa inside and out -- so she is less prone to getting nonresponse, less prone to have biased nonresponse, and more capable of creating a model of the situation that doesn't heavily rely on the conventional wisdom.

"Polling is and always has been about applying assumptions to the Raw numbers. 

Supposed to you have a poll of a thousand random people in North carolina. Ignore the mechanism for the moment. 

You get numeric responses and demographic data. But then you realize you had 380 African-American respondents to your poll. 

Well that's not going to be right. North Carolina is only 22% african-american. So your poll is going to be skewed based on the inadvertent oversampling of african-americans.   

So you weght the results of your poll to account for the oversampling. 

You also see that the ages in your poll skewed older than average. Maybe it's because young people don't answer their phones when a strange number calls.  So you weight the responses to account for that undersampling of young people. 

And then you have the question of how you translate your raw pole responses into actual election data when no one knows exactly what voter turnout numbers you're going to look like. See you make some assumptions about voter turnout and apply those to create a likely voters result. 

If you apply those assumptions and get a result that's in the ballpark of what other people are getting, you assume that you were probably fairly accurate. 

On the other hand, if you get a result that's 10% points off, you are more likely to question your result.  

It's scientific of A Sort but it's all about hypothesis compared to the final vote. And that's the tricky part because you can't know whether you are predictions or assumptions are accurate until we get to the final vote.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Across the number of polls we've seen, there should be more outliers in both directions. The lack of them is what makes the herding obvious. The reasons for the herding aren't really important, only that they devalue the polls.

The interesting point with the Selzer poll is that it is an outlier from probably the most consistently accurate and independent pollster in the business.

"This is anecdotal and I'm biased BUT:


Trump's performance in 2016 and 2020 were nearly identical (he barely won, then barely lost), so his support was pretty sticky.


Then AFTER the 2020 election he orchestrated an insurrection, his party and Supreme Court choices started banning abortions and most of his own cabinet says he's a threat to our Republic and cannot be given back power.


It seems he's gained ground in young, low propensity voters and almost certainly gets a boost from racists and exists compared to when 2 white males were the choices. However, I generally think he already had that vote locked in anyway.


The 2022 mid-terms surprised in favor of Democrats pretty much everywhere.


I simply don't see how Trump being on the ballot is going to improve upon that when Dems tend to do better in Presidential elections compared to midterms, the midterms surprised for Democrats, and in the last elections he hadn't yet committed insurrection, become a convicted felon, stolen national security secrets, or been tied to banning abortion yet.


Not to mention the economy is strong, unemployment low, inflation normalized and markets at record highs, which favors the incumbent party.


It just doesn't add up to me. I know multiple Reoublicans who voted for him once or twice and will still be voting down ballot for Republicans, but are voting for Harris. These coworkers, friends and family have never once voted for a Democrat in their lives.


Yet I know of no one that is switching to Trump from voting Democrat their whole lives. Even ones that were Bernie supporters and didn't vote for Hillary (generally by not voting) are voting for Harris.

Since it‚Äôs not a bookie in the traditional sense where a bookie would constantly be changing the odds to try to get equal money on both sides of a bet (all while having a Vig built in), Polymarket odds only change as a function of people actually buying the smart contracts. 

So if you have a bunch of right-wing rich assholes that want to skew the odds to make Trump look better by buying a bunch of Trump-to-win smart contracts and increasing the price of those contracts (and as a result, increasing his implied odds); then arbitrage bettors can take hella advantage.

Warren v. District of Columbia (1981): The District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that police do not owe a specific duty to provide police services to specific citizens based on the public duty doctrine. This decision was later affirmed by the Supreme Court.

During his rally in Greensboro, N.C. on Saturday night, Donald Trump bragged, ‚ÄúWe have had the biggest rallies in the history of any country, and every rally is full. You do not have any seats that are empty. You did not have anything.‚Äù

But immediately after that comment, a cameraman for NTD.com smartly panned the stadium, zooming in on sections of empty seats and people exiting the arena, although it‚Äôs unclear whether those attendees are leaving the venue entirely.

"There's a MAGA supporter somewhere who is frustrated because the libs keep making a big deal over Trump's rally crowd sizes instead of more substantive things.

But Trump is to blame for this.  Trump is the one who makes a big deal over his rally crowd sizes.  The ""libs"" are just riffing on that.  If MAGA folks want them to stop, they should tell Trump to stop bringing it up so much.

Trump has the power to be a ""substantive"" statesman rather than a buffoon. He could hire good speech writers and actually give the kind of compelling speeches at these rallies that would draw big crowds at future rallies. 

But instead, what does he do?  He wastes everyone's time complaining about microphones and how he isn't going to pay people. [He complains about his hair.](https://www.the-express.com/news/politics/153476/trump-pauses-rally-meltdown-bad-hair-day.)

I already know how MAGAs will defend Trump.  ""He's probably unable to see all the empty seats because the lights from the stage are blinding him! LEAVE HIM ALONE!""

He's promising to ban vaccines, get fluoride out of the water, destroy healthcare, set women's rights back 100 years, imprison gay people, and put one of the worst oligarchs in charge of dismantling the federal government even though he came and worked here illegally. 

Only a nation of selfish, stupid assholes could vote for this guy and the fact that it's so close that it's a nail-biter shows that we have a lot of stupid, selfish, violent assholes and lunatics out there.  Rather than admit he might lose an election, he's already making excuses for losing, including telling the part of the country that has formed a cult around him that he can't lose because it would be ""cheating"" if he loses.

Meanwhile, his voters are out there setting ballots on fire, they're trying to file lawsuits instead of letting the election happen as it's supposed to, they're making up nonsensical rules that would allow them to basically throw the results out if he loses.

There are bad apples on both sides (GOP has disproportionately more though) but IMO all of those should be punished. We shouldn't build democracy on top of corruption.

I'm of a belief that people can have different opinion what's best for the country, but as long as they want the best for it they will modify their beliefs if an evidence is presented.

Good luck with that one. 

On the other hand, the rest of us (again, personal anecdote) are voting for Harris. Most of us voted early. I 100% believe there are additional trump supporters, but they don't talk about it publicly. I'm not just speaking as a Texas transplant, because I‚Äôm a Virginia native, but I also know quite a few people along the east coast (mainly D.C.) and a couple of Black people in the midwest. If they did or plan to vote for him, they don't talk about it.

"Fundamentally a lot of blacks are fairly aligned with social conservative thought.  They don't like LGBT+, are fairly religous, and believe in more paternal thought.  So the republicans courting them makes sense as if that demographic switched or became a swing voting group, it would be hard for Democrats to win.  
  
The consistent problem they run into is 2 fold: 1.  blacks are in general in favor of social programs as they're group is still dealing with massive issuesin their community.  So they would like to have social programs to help their group try to rise above.  I honestly think this could be overcome but.... 

The biggest (and not surprising) issue is the racism.  They can't court black people because a great majority of their people use blacks as the boogy man for various social, economic, and poltical woes.  So if they actually were to try to court blacks a lot of their base will see it as a betrayal and start to not vote making it a net loss.

If you twist the facts enough, you could argue there is a kernel of truth here because there was a warning 2 years before that his unit _could_ eventually be deployed. Not ‚Äúwill be‚Äù, ‚Äúcould be‚Äù.  He served 24-years including a stint where he reenlisted after 9/11 which meant he could have been called up at any time. 

He retired to run for office. Not to avoid combat. 

However you want to twist the facts I‚Äôll take that over Trump getting his doctor to say he had bone spurs so he could avoid the draft.

"As a lawyer... we actually need lawyers there.  We are trained in how to reason through something to all possible conclusions, and that is a fundamentally critical skill for the actual job of voting on legislation.  

But, we also need more of a certain type of lawyer.  Really, what we need is people who have the written description of what a lawyer is supposed to be, someone who follows our basic rules of ""diligence and competence"" and also the rules that we are more known for ignoring, such as civility and professionalism.  

Many lawyers in government fail at rule one, competence, because they tend to have no freaking clue what they are talking about when it comes to the Constitution.  I would say that at best, conservatives are lying 80% of the time when they claim that something is or is not constitutional, and that is truly bizarre.  I remember sitting in my first constitutional law class and wondering how on earth anyone could possibly exit the class believing in GOP talking points, and yet the Federalist Society and other things actually exist and are full of lawyers who took and ignored con law 1.  But then I took a few upper level con law classes and I guess you could say it got worse.  Dang near nobody in politics speaks correctly about executive power, except for Obama and Biden, who have been really impressive in their deference to the Constitution, especially when their move was compliant and controversial.  There are things that each of them did that I do not personally like but where I am impressed by how they followed the rules.  They were, after all, both lawyers, just like Hillary and Kamala, and Bill Clinton and I suspect most other Democratic Presidents, though I don't really want to take the time to count.  I don't know why I haven't memorized that; I can confirm that prior to Trump, every President had served as a governor, senator (or at least VP), or general back more than a century, and really all of those jobs are generally dominated by lawyers just by nature.  We have relevant training, and it's fair to say that a majority of people who leave high school intending to become politicians go to law school specifically to learn the trade.  Lawyers are to government as engineers are to manufacturing, and yet, nobody complains when there are too many engineers running businesses.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Teenage babysitters get paid like 10 bucks an hour. A teacher supervises and instructs 25 kids for 6 hours per day, drawing on specialized knowledge that they trained for years to teach. Let's pretend they got paid 10 bucks per hour per kid.

25 kids x 10 bucks an hour x 6 hours teaching per day = $1500 per day

$1500 x 180 days per year (typical minimum number of school days) = $270,000 per year

And that's just for hours actually giving instruction. This doesn't factor in hours spent on lesson plans, grading papers, parent teacher conferences, staff meetings, and all the other things these people do every day. $400k is a conservative valuation on all of this time and effort.

Kind of a separate issue back in recent news is the role of experts and career regulators - ideally, a statute should be left blank as to specific scientific details, such as the numbers that are set as limits in certain regulations, with the Executive Branch regulatory process spelling out those details with more input from scientists than lawyers.  This should actually be a team process, with the ""office"" of the legislator containing all of these advisors and the actual representative being kind of the leader of that team but ultimately following its collective advice.

"CEOs are paid in a fairly irrational way.  There is not necessarily any correlation between their compensation and their competence.  It's more political than politics and it's debatable how much work many of them even do.  

Teachers perform fundamentally important work.  It is a physically hard job, with variable hours that can be extremely arduous, and are often untracked for compensation.  Most teachers are salaried, and get no overtime pay, but often do hours and hours of work at home throughout the year, with certain time periods and deadlines being more extreme.  There is a reverse variation to that, as well; some teachers may get more efficient with their prep work over time, but the best ones still devote more time than they are paid for even after they've developed their curricula very thoroughly.  And of course, that doesn't really work forever for anyone, as textbooks and standardized tests are always changing along with curriculum standards that filter in sometimes confusing ways between agencies and layers of democracy.  A teacher could spend five years refining a curriculum only for the local school board to decide for some arbitrary reason to switch textbooks and shake everything up, and there is never compensation for that.

The biggest problem is how teacher salaries are set, though.  This is because schools are primarily funded by local property taxes, and usually approved in public votes.  It's very hard to get the majority of voters to agree to raises for teachers, and the majority of voters often don't seem to understand how salaries should work.  If you look at how it works and who gets to vote, a lot of the voters don't have kids so see paying teachers as a burden and not worthwhile.  Then you've got residents who do have kids but don't make that much money... often, the families of grade school kids have below median household incomes, and so they themselves might not want to vote for a raise that has some teachers getting paid more than they do.  

I think it seems likely that these structural factors tend to put downward pressure on school boards when setting teacher pay, and also make the problem very hard to solve.  I personally think the whole system of funding needs to change.  Schools should not be funded by local taxes that individuals can directly vote to lower.  

There are a number of ways to reform this.  I think that the simplest, and this has been done in a handful of states, is to set the salaries according to an index that is set at the state level, taking that power away from the local taxpayer.  Of course, I can hear immediately the replies about how it's fundamentally wrong to take power away from the local taxpayer... and unfortunately, it takes longe than a bumper sticker to explain the problem.  So, it's quite hard to accomplish.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Borrowed from guess who? He is more of a thief than a genius.

[Fake video of Georgia voter fraud is Russian misinformation, US officials say](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/01/georgia-voter-fraud-video-fake-russia/75993122007/)


Friday‚Äôs disclosure follows the ODNI‚Äôs public attribution of three other fake videos in recent weeks to Russia. They included one falsely accusing Harris of paralyzing a teenage girl in a hit and run and another falsely accusing her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, of sexual abuse.

A third fake video made and circulated by Russia purported to show pro-Harris voters illegally ripping up Trump mail-in ballots in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, an ODNI official said.

‚ÄúThis Russian activity is part of Moscow‚Äôs broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans,‚Äù ODNI said. It was the latest of several election updates warning Americans of what it describes as ‚Äúforeign malign influence operations.‚Äù

The Elon Musk factor
The video is the latest salvo in an intensifying Kremlin campaign to smear Vice President Harris and boost what intelligence officials say is¬†Vladimir Putin‚Äôs preferred candidate,¬†former President Donald Trump, in the waning days of the razor-close Nov. 5 election.

[Investigating Musk‚Äôs far-fetched claim about Democrats importing voters](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd5l0d3794o)


Since endorsing Donald Trump for president in July, Elon Musk - the owner of X - has posted about the US election hundreds of times, attracting more than four billion views.
BBC Verify, working with data firm Node XL, analysed all of his posts since then - over 8,000 - and searched for key words to track the election issues he has been posting about most to his 200 million followers.
Immigration and voting emerge as key themes with Mr Musk engaging with misinformation online about ‚Äúillegal aliens‚Äù voting in this election.
He has also claimed repeatedly that Democrats have been ‚Äúimporting‚Äù immigrants who will vote for them in future elections.

Among the narratives being pushed in the community is one that has become a pet conspiracy theory of Musk‚Äôs. The SpaceX CEO has loudly and oftenmade the false claim that the Biden administration was ‚Äúimporting voters‚Äù in the form of ‚Äúunvetted illegal immigrants‚Äù. In the last few days, a Musk-funded super Pac has been pushing a fake pro-Kamala Harris initiative called Project 2028. The initiative has posted fake pro-Harris ads and sent texts to voters that include claims that Harris will be opening the country‚Äôs borders and is pushing for undocumented immigrants to be able to vote. Non-citizens are not allowed to vote in the US, and there is no available evidence they are voting in droves as claimed. Users in the community are sharing videosthey say provides evidence that Democrats are ‚Äúbussing‚Äù undocumented immigrants to cast votes in their favor.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"So trump won Texas by 5.5 points in 2020. He won Iowa by 8 points in 2020. That poll in Iowa that just came out put Harris up by 3 points there, or an 11 point swing from 2020, of the numbers actually translate to votes (big if, I realize). What's interesting about the Iowa poll to me is that Iowa doesn't exist in total isolation. If Harris truly has swung the electorate 11 points since 2020 in Iowa, she's almost certainly swung it in other states as well, and depending on demographics, by wider or narrow margins. Iowa is whiter than Texas, which means a bigger percentage of Iowa's population is Trump's core demographic. That, combined with an historically unpopular Senator running on the same ticket as Trump, and I'm starting to see a real possibility that Texas turns blue this year. 

I've been saying since 2016 that Texas would flip in 2028 regardless just because of shifting demographics, but the perfect storm of Cruz being a weird, awful human (well, allegedly human) while having a popular, charismatic opponent, plus the Dobbs decision, plus the complete lack of enthusiasm for team Trump this cycle, and I think there's a very real chance it could happen in 2024.

"I‚Äôve been following our early voter numbers compared to 2020 and 2016 (2020 is an outlier year because we had an extra week of EV and expanded mail-in ballots) as well as demographics of early voters.

What I can tell you, Texas already beat both the number and percentage of voter turnout in 2016 this year. At 8.5M we‚Äôre behind 2020‚Äôs number (remember there was one more week), but if 2020 had been like any other year Texas early voting is ahead. Considering in 2016 4M showed up on Election Day almost doubling the votes, in 2020 about 2M showed up, about 13% of total vote. Looking at both those years and making some adjustments for the outlier year, total voter turnout should be between 53%-88%, the average being 74% which would beat 2020‚Äôs recent record year. 

Also keep in mind Texas added 1.7M registered voters between 2020 and 2024, so the turnout percentage might stay the same, but total votes cast will likely exceed 2020.

Why does that matter? What we‚Äôve seen is that when more people turnout to vote the higher the chance for democrats, specifically in Texas. Yes, they haven‚Äôt won Senate or President since 1992, but the margins are shrinking.

Also demographically, our age and gender demographics look very similar to Georgia‚Äôs in 2020, minor exception early vote still has the under 29‚Äôs a bit lower than  Georgia. Women are way out voting men, even higher than the national average. 

Last thing 18% of Republicans voted for Haley in the primaries. I ran some numbers, if independents break even 1% more for Dems than 2020, Democrats go all in on blue, and that 18% of Haley voters don‚Äôt vote for Trump, the race could look like this 50% - 48% Kamala, a difference of about 200K votes, if vote total stays the same as 2020. 

I dabble in data analysis at my job, so this is not my forte especially political data, but I‚Äôve lived in Texas for 15 years and do understand basic premise of measuring the information. It is not impossible for this to happen. 

I think it could also potentially go the other way for Trump. At minimum it should be a close race. 

The big question, honestly is this, we have very high turnout of suburban voters, who are they breaking for in Texas? I think that will be the big decider. 

No matter what I‚Äôve said or the pollsters, go out and vote!! Nothing matters but the count on Election Day.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

It doesn't matter that there is literally no way for the husband to have proof. Modern conservatives haven't needed proof of anything for them to be moved towards violence. If they *feel* it, they believe it.

So if some poor woman's husband *feels* like their partner voted against Trump, that's enough of a justification to do whatever they want. 

Add in that Trump *himself* routinely advocates for violence for anyone who is against him (protestors at rallies, people in the press, for God's sake, he literally just said he'd have Liz Cheney executed by firing squad), and it is almost a certainty that a female partner of a MAGA male will be the victim of violence.

A basic theological concept is so-called 'saving grace' stating that faith not works confer entrance to eternal bliss or the lack thereof conferring eternal damnation.

Faith has always been shown or proven by loyalty to either the religion or the church or both.  Loyalty confreres eternal reward.

What if deeds were to be the case?  Might people try harder to be good to one another?  While christians claim that their religion puts that requirement to its devotees, loyalty to the church/religion is the ***real*** substance.

Sure some republicans may not be voting for Trump, but that number can‚Äôt be more than 5-10% max.  It‚Äôs probably significantly less.

That said, I feel we are at a tipping point here, albeit a day before the election. It‚Äôs truly like coach Walz has stated. It‚Äôs 4th down in the 4th quarter, we are down a point and have 3 yards to go with 10 seconds on the clock. All gas, no breaks. We‚Äôll sleep when we‚Äôre dead.

This year, it seems the prevailing wisdom is that part of the closeness is down to those pollsters leaning on ‚Äúit‚Äôs a toss up!‚Äù since it allows them to be wrong in a way that minimizes how much they look like schmucks for getting things wrong if they turn the whole thing into one data-toward shrug emoji.

In Michigan in September, he stated, ""If I lose - I'll tell you what, it's possible. Because they cheat. **That's the only way we're gonna lose, because they cheat.**""

">. I get why people outside the US would be more concerned about the outcome of the US election than even their own. 

Poilievre is a mini-Trump populist nightmare.

Let me tell you why women in Canada (ie: me) are equally as concerned about the upcoming election here: 

Contrary to popular belief, we do not currently have *any* enshrined abortion rights in Canada. That's also precisely why we have the most liberal access to abortion in the world. There are simply no laws governing it - it's not illegal, nor is it legal. 

What that also means is that there's nothing to overturn in order to ban abortion, or set limits on it. It just requires a majority government to unilaterally pass a law. 

The only reason it's been this way since R v. Morgentaler is that it's been a nuclear topic for any government since. With the populist creep over the border, that's no longer the case. 

There are currently ZERO pro-choice Conservative MPs. Not one. And they've already tried to sneak through legislation that would give fetuses personhood status (under the insulting guise of protecting pregnant women from abuse).

Edit to add: also, geographically speaking - do we want a Canadian PM who will fall in line with Trump and open up the Arctic ocean to Putin, putting our allies in Denmark at risk? Trump already has eyes on Greenland. 

Do we want a Canada that will diplomatically shift away from a Labour UK and closer to a Trump America? Do we want a Canada that will automatically side with Trump in trade disputes with Mexico?

Do we want a Canada that pulls its support for Ukraine, and halts peacekeeping missions in Cyprus, Sudan, the Congo, and Syria?",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"It's really hard to say.  The Trump voters are loud and unapologetic, and a lot of Harris voters are afraid to put a sign up because they don't want to have their house vandalized.  The Trump signs are also being bankrolled largely by one individual who is happily dropping off piles of signs at people's houses.

I had canvassers come to my house today, and they happily gave me a Harris sign. I think this is the first time I've ever had canvassers come around with signs, so that's awesome.  But my house is now the only one on our street with a Harris sign, versus 3 Trump houses.

"My bodily autonomy doesn't give a fuck about your opinion on a valid medical procedure. Abortions are healthcare whether you like them or not. You have no right to have an opinion on other people having abortions.¬†


- Abortions save lives
- Abortions save innocent lives
- Abortions prevent **innocent infants from being forcibly born only to suffer for hours before passing away**
- Abortions save mothers who already have children and their next wanted pregnancy risks their life by going sceptic
- Abortions prevent women from being murdered by partners who don't want them pregnant¬†
- Abortions prevent thousands of children from being forcibly born only to be neglected, abused, abandoned, or killed


Every child deserves to be born into or to a family that will love them and care for them. Abortions are healthcare. It's nice to hear you voting for the sane choice, a future president with **actual** policies and not full of bullshit and hate rhetoric, but it doesn't save you from being a terrible person.¬† You're only posting to get pats on the back to fuel your ego and not because you give a damn about doing the right thing. In other words, a typical post expected of a religious leader in this country.


Your congregation and fellow citizens deserve better. Your god expects better, if you even actually believe and don't just use him as an excuse to manipulate others.


I refuse to give you the ego fuel you clearly so desperately crave and instead say: shame on you. Do better. Be a better human being. A better leader. You don't have to like abortions or gay people but you do, as a memeber of a functioning society, have to accept that they are a part of life that does zero harm to you and your life and instead allow others to live their lives another day.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"100% serious answer:

They know Trump is not great. They do. (Well, most of them. Some actually are that deluded.). But it always and forever goes back to messaging. They have been primed for literal decades to see Democrats as the enemy. So even though Trump is ‚Äúflawed‚Äù, that‚Äôs better than ‚Äúevil.‚Äù So he‚Äôs their guy.

Plus, it doesn‚Äôt hurt that they‚Äôre constantly immersing themselves in media that works overtime to excuse everything he does. An entire industry has been built around that because it‚Äôs effective.

But here‚Äôs the other bit: many so-called Christians are Christian because they feel like it elevates them above everyone else. They‚Äôre not ‚Äúsinners‚Äù, or at least not sinners who will be eternally punished for it. They will be elevated above *those* sinners. They‚Äôre special. Trump‚Äôs rhetoric feeds into this ‚ÄúI‚Äôm special‚Äù worldview they have because he outright tells them that they are better than those others over there - it‚Äôs not coincidence that Trump‚Äôs targets are seen by his base as sinful even when it‚Äôs something the Bible never actually says a word on (like being trans, or *women* who seek an abortion since the only relevant passage there is the one where abortion was part of the priests‚Äô ritual if the mother had cheated, but I digress). Christianity has primed them to believe this, which is why the American Christian church and Republicanism were able to mesh themselves together so thoroughly.

The collective message of both groups isn‚Äôt ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make the world better for everyone‚Äù, but ‚Äúwe rightly deserve the benefits of society because we are the good ones; those who are not part of our group are a danger to us and our way of life. They are not like us.‚Äù",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"In my view, a lot of it has to do with conservative media exploiting the ""disgust"" reaction conservatives are vulnerable to: https://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/2525-politics-and-maggots  
  
____  
  
Politics and maggots  (Yale 2009)  
___  
Pus, maggots, vomit, feces, rotten food: in almost every human society, people share a knee-jerk revulsion for certain substances. Now, Yale psychologist Paul Bloom and his colleagues have found that the level of disgust a person feels can predict his or her political orientation. In a word: **""We found that conservatives are more easily disgusted than liberals.""**  
  
Using a standard political orientation scale and the Disgust Sensitivity Scale -- also a standard psychological measuring tool, developed in 1994 to compare individuals' reactions to such things as monkey meat, gore, and sex with animals -- the researchers tested 181 adults across the country. They discovered a significant correlation between conservatism and strong feelings of being grossed out. The correlation also held among 91 Cornell undergraduates and was strongest when the political issues tested involved gay marriage or abortion. (The research appeared in June in Cognition and Emotion.)  
  
Early in our evolution, disgust may have functioned as a way to ward us away from things that were bad to eat. Today it plays out in disagreements over policy. While Bloom finds disgust a ""terribly corrosive emotion,"" and wishes we could abandon it in favor of rationality, he feels there's a risk in ignoring it. ""Our findings reinforce the importance of the emotions in policy and morality. A lot of these issues are still driven by the gut.""",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"It's complex, but the first factor I'd mention is that religion serves as a tribal substitute in our lives, it's a set of customs that define an in group and ""linked family of families"" as a video game character and his writer put it. You often feel comfortable going to that community for support, you know who's contributing. Many of those tribes have a difficult time including those coming in with the tide of American demographic change, they are *racist.* Trump's racist as shit, and most other Republican candidates before him would never say the quiet part out loud at least due to their agency in that demographic change: they *need* specifically illegal immigrants.

The second part is that American religious life is characterized by ""great awakenings,"" every forty to sixty years a wave of charisma and revitalization affects its Protestant and frequently Calvinistically derived Christian stock (Evangelicals). I personally think it's because they largely lack a source of religious authority such as a Pope or a Metropolitan or a ""Supreme Governor,"" so when the tent revivals and super preachers come once a generation or two there's no institutional defense. Trump hit right at the same time those people were feeling lost and looking for guidance, when church attendance was dropping (they call it ""the Great Falling Away""), so he became a *de facto* religious leader. He promises a return to the good old days, what so many yearn for in their hearts. It's so obviously a lie, but we rarely have defenses against lies we want to hear.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

...maybe more than Trump, but not really. Karl Rove and Dick Cheney were definitely significant driving forces in how we got to where we are today. They are still awful human beings. It's just that the Trump administration was just so much worse than anyone before him.

To me, the biggest difference is that he made discourse so much worse, and made Americans hate each other more than ever before, all for his benefit. How politics is played has changed forever for the worse, and civility is pretty close to dead. And what's worse is the media continue to play into his hand because that's what's profitable for them.

> Kamala Harris made a last-minute appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to inject a little humor into the last days of the presidential campaign.

> Rudolph&#039;s Harris then asked for a minute to reflect before her last campaign speech, and looked into the mirror and saw the real Harris after saying, &quot;I wish I could talk to someone who&#039;s been in my shoes, you know, a Black, South Asian woman running for President. Preferably from the Bay Area.&quot;.

> Popular on Variety The duo then talks about how &quot;You can do something your opponent cannot do: You can open doors Like to a garbage truck.&quot; Real Harris then asks Rudolph about her impression, saying, &quot;I don&#039;t really laugh like that, do I?&quot; to which Rudolph responds, &quot;A little bit.&quot; They also mention how America needs to &quot;Keep Kamala and carry on-a-la.""

In the View, when she exchanges smiles with Whoopi and starts giggling, it was so warm and genuine. Or when she jokes in Kalamazoo, ‚ÄúI know you were about to say Kamala-zoo!‚Äù

It‚Äôs like she knew we needed more of her real human-ness compared to whatever the fuck lab rejects the Heritage Foundation and Putin let loose from their magma layer dungeons.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"This bit was actually done really well.  It was also hilarious for Maya to face Kamala and it did appear that they hadn't really rehearsed it together much because they kept cracking each other up.   The door comment was hilarious.  

Their puns around her name were pretty stellar too.

What was up with Trump not opening that door anyways?  He like fully missed the handle a couple of times with weird swipes - do both of his eyes work?  Seems like something that would happen to someone with only one good eye as depth perception gets messed up.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Roan really showed her age and immaturity when she went off on TikTok about it.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"I'll probably be downvoted, but oh well.

Roan is disappointing on many levels, IMHO.

She's co-opted drag queen looks for sale, but doesn't really show public support in ways that matter for drag artists.  Her musical skills and performances are actually kind of average beyond the ""look how I can dress!"" act.

It feels like an entitled dressup for eyeballs, where she is ignorant about the fact that she's representing a group of people who are very much under attack by Republicans and supported by Democrats.  But I don't see how she supports drag performers, despite all the benefit she gets for adopting their looks in performances.  An act or two comes out as supporting acts at her concerts now, but she doesn't talk or do anything else to consistently to help the people whose looks help sell her music.

She doesn't want to be fit into a box politically, but dropped the Biden White House invitation due to politics.

On that point, she won't support the only US political party that actually has been trying to ensure equality and special consideration for belequered minority groups over the years, including LGBTQ+, for someone who likes to drop mentions about her being gay somewhat regularly.

She's highly sensitive about criticism or even feedback that she doesn't feel is positive.  Fame came on fast, but again part of it is because of the persona she's adopted that is from other groups and which she uses to sell her act

Honestly, she comes off as an entitled white bisexual who wants to pick and choose which segment in LGBTQ+ matters while seeking PR benefits by alignment with them, and that segment appears kind of narrow and revolves around herself in interviews.  She's young, appears naive and doesn't understand how to look at the bigger picture.

There are zero plans to constantly and ever more egregiously break laws and use the growing protests that will create as an excuse to deploy the military domestically and use thr Project 2025 playbook to corrupt the DoJ and begin extrajudicially detaining political and social leaders for ""inciting riots, disturbing the peace, radicalization, insurrection, etc"".


And there's definitely ZERO chance this begins via the plan of rounding up millions of migrants, whose countries won't allow them to be returned, which means they simply have to be detained in camps.¬†


In that interview last week that advisor said that they can round up entire families... even if the babies/children/dependents are natural born U.S. citizens.¬†

By the time you get to the next election he'll have no choice but to selflessly stay in power until ""law and order"" is restored.


To really boil the pot and create domestic unrest you need to crash the economy by putting tariffs on everything which starts a tit for tat trade war of retaliatory tariffs with dozens of countries (like what happened just before the Great Depression). Growth will slow at the same time that inflation rises.

> Political observers expressed shock Saturday evening as the Des Moines Register released its final poll before Election Day showing Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris leading Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by three points.

> Lyz Lenz, a journalist based in Iowa, said she believed the poll could be linked to one major change in Iowa since the last presidential election: the six-week abortion ban that took effect in July, banning abortion care after fetal cardiac activity can be detected.

> &quot;Women are furious.&quot; Daniel Nichanian, editor-in-chief and founder of the digital magazine Bolts, said the result could preview losses for state Supreme Court justices who have upheld abortion bans in a number of states, including Iowa.

"I grew up in Iowa, spent nearly 40 years there before moving to Texas. My small town had 3,500 people, with a Co-op right in the middle of it.

Iowa is largely rural or smaller towns, with a strong Patriarchal tradition rooted in generational farming. They have traditional family and social values. The farmers are conservative but also exceedingly keen, not at all the rubes many expect. They're business owners in an extremely complicated business.

Over the last 30 or so years many farms have been purchased by commercial farming companies. Lots of smaller farmers sold outright (because their children went to college, moved away) and many continue to work the farm as employees.

Now privately owned farms are uncommon, and they fight hard to survive.

That's a bitter pill for many in the state.

They saw in Trump someone who at least appeared to hold those traditional values as much as they do, and out of frustration, anger at feeling cheated and forgotten they embraced him.

What they got instead were tariffs that killed their soybean contracts, subsidies meant to offset the loses which are expiring and those contracts are never coming back. That put a lot of hardship on a lot of farms, already struggling to survive.

The commercial farms are large enough to offset their losses and survive, or at the very least secure loans small farmers can't. The privately owned farms are fighting for their lives, with commercial farms waiting to swoop in like vultures.

Iowa farmers are tough, conservative to their core and some of the most stubborn people you will ever meet.

They don't like to admit they're wrong and rarely will, but one thing is certain above all:

"Selzer is the gold standard Iowa poll for a reason. With the exception of the 2018 governor election, her firm has correctly predicted the winner in every statewide race since the 2008 presidential election, and almost always within 1-2% of the actual result. 

Selzer was one of the first polls predicting Obama would win the 2008 Democratic caucus in Iowa, catching his late surge in support. They were also one of the only polls to predict Trump would win Iowa by a massive margin in 2016 (+7 predicted, +9.5 actual), catching a late surge when basically every other poll, including other reputable pollsters like Ipsos, Emerson, and Quinnipiac predicted a competitive election.

Even if we assume the 3.4% margin of error favors Trump *and* Selzer overestimated Harris by 2-3% (so Harris+3 is actually Trump +2 or +3), that‚Äôs a 5-6% reduction compared to 2020.

Well, I was told I needed to terminate because I had a blood clot a few months earlier and the chance of me surviving a pregnancy was slim, the fetus -
None. 

My sister had a fetus die at 20 weeks gestation. It was traumatic, mostly because of our evangelical parents shaming her for her D&C. She was 31 and long married at that time.

First off, economic policy generally lags a few years before having a significant impact. So you wouldn‚Äôt have seen the effects of trump admin policies until near the end of his term, or even the start of Biden‚Äôs term. 

Secondly, trump was handed a booming economy from Obama. But trumps trade wars and policies eroded that economy, so that even before Covid, the economy had already taken a downturn. 

Covid also majorly screwed up the economy. And only due to Biden‚Äôs policies did we recover as quickly as we did. The trump administration seriously messed up the Covid response, which made the economy significantly worse than it would have been if they had followed the pandemic playbook created by the previous administration. 

And inflation was not caused by Biden. It was caused by trump trade wars, Covid, supply chain disruptions from the Panama Canal, and a lack of regulations on businesses allowing unmitigated price inflation. Biden policies have reduced inflation, and in fact the US experienced less inflation than most other countries.

"The unifying thread behind trump support is not evangelicalism, or christianity. Almost 70% of americans identify as christian, if trump truly had the christian vote locked up, he would win all 50 states. 

The singular thread behind trump support is whiteness, and white supremacy. Christianity is just used as cover for white supremacy to instill its beliefs. There are literally millions of Christians who recognize and reject trump as a snake oil grifter, and understand he is the most non-christian to present himself as such. He doesn't believe in the bible or its teachings, [he's clearly never read it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERUngQUCsyE). He is a 'christian' that does not pray, that does not believe in redemption. That cheats on his wives, and sexually assaults women and children. He clearly does not believe in helping the poor, loving your neighbors, giving back to society or any of the actual teachings of christ. This is why whenever one tries to have a good faith debate with a trump supporter (be them christian or not), showing them evidence of what trump actually does (be it related to studying the bible, constitution, the first amendment, the second amendment, the economy, whatever), compared to what said trump supporter says matters to them, is fully disregarded despite the mountains of contrary evidence. Because those things are ultimately not what actually matters to trump supporters. 

What trump actually offers, is the upholding of the belief that whiteness is a natural good, and non-whites are evil. This is not new to GOP politics, but it has been decades since the mask was ripped off like this. The brazenness of it is what makes it so specifically attractive. People who were shamed for this racist mentality and had to hear it code-worded through things like 'busing rights', or 'welfare queens', suddenly had an outlet politician who shared and yelled their inner thoughts. They found a home in trump, but even more importantly they had a path to make their bigotry legal, to hurt the people they wanted to hurt. Trump offers the continuation of that historical white power that many white people yearn for the days of. Trump is not luring evangelicals to satan, he is simply empowering white supremacists in modern times.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

> The devil's second temptation is the offer of protection and safety. In the gospel, he urges Jesus to jump off the roof of the temple ‚Äî if he is truly the son of God, surely his father, will protect him. Jesus replies that we must not put the Lord God to the test. This is an interesting temptation that we often encounter in life. The desire for comfort, safety and protection is almost universal. In my career, I have greatly desired job protection, for example, but that is never guaranteed when you are committed to telling the truth. Diplomacy was never my strong suit and my working life has been a struggle. I wish it weren't that way, but over time it has taught me that sometimes security becomes more important to people than their own integrity.  
> 
> I see that in the evangelical support of Donald Trump. His offer of protection is clear, and something he discusses all the time. He promises to keep the Christians safe from the evil forces of liberalism. The left is coming for your guns, he tells them. They will persecute you for your Christian faith. Your children are in danger of conversion by the ""woke"" mob on college campuses, on television, in the big cities. Never fear, believing Christians, Donald Trump will keep you safe.
> 
> The problem with this message ‚Äî other than the fact that it comes from the devil ‚Äî is that there was no promise of safety for those who chose to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. Indeed, it is the follower who risks their own safety by choosing to love their enemies, heal the sick, serve the poor and love those who are cast out, imprisoned or powerless.

I used to be a devout member of the church. But no matter what we claim about our faith in Jesus, there‚Äôs often more value placed on acquiring material wealth. In my view, the church operates much like a multi-level marketing scheme. Trump resonates with church leaders because he‚Äôs a master marketer at a national scale, just as many pastors are at a local level. He sells his followers a distorted faith where they are the chosen people, and he is their messiah. He exploits insecurities around sexual freedom, a sensitive area in churches where repression and, too often, abuse are tolerated. Allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump mean little to his supporters, as many church leaders are guilty of similar offenses. At its core, the church seems driven by power‚Äîspecifically, power for men, mostly white, but some Black and Hispanic as well. We often label evangelicals as if it implies ethical or moral superiority, but I believe it‚Äôs a facade. The term has come to signify a loyalty to certain cultural and political ideals rather than a commitment to true Christian values like compassion, humility, and justice. Instead, what‚Äôs often upheld is a selective morality that serves to maintain control and reinforce existing power structures. This pursuit of power, cloaked in the language of faith, ultimately compromises the very principles the church claims to stand for.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

>¬†‚ÄúWhat was alarming to me is that in most of these scenarios, when the pastor would say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm literally quoting Jesus Christ,‚Äô the response would not be, ‚ÄòI apologize.‚Äô The response would be, ‚ÄòYes, but that doesn‚Äôt work anymore.

"Reminder: The Evangelical movement didn't start getting shitty with Trump, they were looking for someone like Trump to lead them. Modern American Christianity is entirely a product of the Reagan era and a response to Jimmy Carter's presidency and a more left leaning SCOTUS ruling against racism.

Look at some of their most popular thought leaders: Dr. James Dobson, Kenneth Copeland, Pat Robertson, Paula White, The Falwells, Franklin Graham (less his father Billy, who was actually anti-racist most of the time).

[Then read up on the history of the Religious Right/Moral Majority](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133/) and realize that it was a movement that started in preparation for the 1980 election, including their modern views on abortion, and you'll understand what's going on much more directly.

Regardless of whether or not God exists, the evangelical movement doesn't exist to serve any deity, it exists to serve the GOP. I actually believe that Christianity would be far, far less common in America without the religious right's rise in the late 1970s. This is not an attack on your own belief in Christ or the bible. This is not me saying Christianity itself is false. You can sincerely have them without following the GOP. But we need to recognize that the culture that has permeated throughout the modern churches since the late 1970s is not actually about faith for its own sake or a religious movement for its own sake, it's entirely a political movement using religion as a propaganda tool.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

As a Christian, it is chilling. It shows that these ""pastors"" who have taken his side have no spiritual discernment. That is, they are not guided by the indwelling Holy Spirit, nor do they even have enough awareness to recognize an obvious parallel of wording.

Trump's offer is so close to Satan's as to be a deliberate mockery. When I read it in the Times article, it was almost like a physical blow, and the writer didn't even draw the parallel himself.

"Yesterday, an [article introduced newly released audio recordings](https://www.thedailybeast.com/listen-to-the-jeffrey-epstein-tapes-i-was-donald-trumps-closest-friend/) of Jeffrey Epstein.  It's a snip from 100 hrs of recorded interviews in 2017 by a book author, while Trump was president, 2 years before Epstein died.

In the audio- which has captions since some audio is faint- he talks about Trump a lot.  He said he was Trumps closest friend for many years.  He talks about the good and bad:   Trump knew real estate extraordinarily well and was an incredible salesman; he liked what Trump was doing for policy 

To contrast with the life of Jesus:

- Epstein said any ‚Äúact of kindness‚Äù would have been an accident.  

- this echos what [Trump's nephew Fred said, when DT told him to let his severely disabled son die](https://youtu.be/iRoEpxA5G9Q?si=NezVrMZ3PlPz87oM);  

- similar to what his Chief of Staff, [General John Kelly said](https://news.yahoo.com/news/john-kelly-says-trump-praised-152833585.html) said- that Trump lacked empathy, based on the disparaging remarks he made multiple times, confirmed by other staff.  


From the Epstein tapes article:  
- he described how he would seduce his friends wives by offering to setup a sexual situation with his friend and a hot young female contestant, but do this while the wife was listening on the phone-- to anger them and later seduce them.

- Epstein alleged, Trump took a woman to what he called ‚Äúthe Egyptian Room‚Äù in an Atlantic City casino. Epstein alleged, ‚ÄúHe came out afterward and said, ‚ÄòIt was great, it was great. The only thing I really like to do is f--- the wives of my best friends. That is just the best.‚Äô‚Äù

There is no pretending, simply there wasn't some large shift exclusive to the 1960s, simply the continuation of previous trends due to the economic development of the South.

In 1952, Eisenhower already won 48% of the Southern vote (opponent 52%), in 1956 he won 50% (opponent 49%), and in 1960, a close election Nixon won 46% (JFK 50.5%), even though he was representing the administration that pushed through 2 civil rights acts and pushed Brown at gunpoint.

> RALEIGH, N.C. - North Carolina had already surpassed its early-voting record set in 2020, but the State Board of Elections announced Sunday that more than 4.2 million voters cast ballots at early in-person voting sites, with turnout in western counties hit by Hurricane Helene outpacing the rest of the state.

> People can simultaneously register to vote and cast ballots at early voting sites.

> Including absentee voting, 4,465,548 voters - or 57% of the state&#039;s 7.8 million registered voters - cast ballots in the general election as of Sunday morning, officials said, noting that turnout may be slightly higher because of a lag between when ballots are cast and when data is uploaded.

"> Including absentee voting, 4,465,548 voters ‚Äî or 57% of the state‚Äôs 7.8 million registered voters ‚Äî cast ballots in the general election as of Sunday morning, officials said, noting that turnout may be slightly higher because of a lag between when ballots are cast and when data is uploaded.

"To add context to the numbers which are great, 5,443,067 total ballots were cast in 2020. We are already at ~78% of the 2020 turnout in a state still recovering from a devastating hurricane, purely in early vote. Turnout in this election is going to be crazy, and can very easily overwhelm all the 50/50 polling. 

This is especially relevant in this case when you consider that polling methodologies have no way to account for enthusiasm especially with young voters who are far less likely to respond to polling. They do not have landlines. They do not answer calls from numbers they don't recognize. They're not clicking on links in texts from random numbers. And I think that goes further than the voters we would typically think of as 'young.' I'm 37. I'm not answering that call. I don't have a landline. I'm not clicking that link. I think we are running up on an era where polling just cannot be meaningfully reliable anymore. Too many people are not reachable by the methods used.

I also think we may have an inverse problem to 2016. Trump's support was under-represented, speculatively because people were ashamed to say they were voting for him. In 2024 the cult is in full swing, and they see participation as validation of their 'movement' because of all the messaging of things being rigged against them. I think your average Trump 'base' supporter is far more likely to respond to polling than your typical democrat, precisely because of the extent to which their devotion to Trump has become the largest part of their personality.

I am cautiously very optimistic.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Sadly it's going to be a long few weeks even after Tuesday, really no matter what.

- If there's a blue wave and Kamala crushes expectations, MAGA will cry foul because of the deviation from pre-election polls. They will use that deviation to justify extreme measures to overturn the result via the courts, by manipulating the certification process at the state level or in Congress, or simply with raw force.
- If it's close, MAGA will engage in whatever lawfare tactics they can to prevent counting of Democratic votes. There will be so much fuckery that we need to be on guard for, and we won't have a completely clear answer about the election results until January 21 when Biden's successor is sworn in.

"Yeah I've seen data that shows that in some states (I think I saw specifically in PA) that the increase in early voting overall shows that more republicans are converting from election day voters to early voters than we're seeing with democrats. Which I suppose means that a lot of those democrats voting early are net-new voters. Or that some republicans are staying home, and simply more of them are voting early this time. So already the numbers look good in early voting for Kamala, and there's a real risk that the election day vote is a disappointment for republicans.

Of course this all depends on democrats actually showing up for the election day vote, but I think there are reasons to be optimistic. And agree she has run an absolutely fantastic campaign. 

The gender gap in early voting to me is probably the most encouraging part. Women are MOTIVATED. And it makes sense. Sexual predator who overturned Roe and lied about it being what everyone wanted, vs the first ever female president? It's compelling.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

They also do online panels that recruit people to participate with ads, which I'd say also young people are going to be less likely to answer to. Physical mail which young people are going to be less likely to answer to, in some cases they'll even physically visit houses, etc.

It's an industry that's really struggling to figure out how to get people to respond in order to get good data. And I do not think they have it figured out.

Fortunately Kamala's campaign hasn't been making those mistakes. She's focused in the right places and has been running the whole time like she's behind.

But agree logic would dictate that the same tired candidate running on the same tired issues, but now with the dual albatrosses of Roe and Jan 6th around his neck should do worse.

"I think a very, very large portion of the voting public has PTSD from 2016.

If it helps, I've been predicting a landslide since the moment Trump declared his candidacy.  Right up to the moment Biden dropped out of the race.  And the moment after he did, up to this day.  Not because of Harris.

Because of January 6th.  I think January 6th was eye opening even for Republicans.  I think Roe V. Wade has been a slow burn that will add a lot of fuel to the fire, but I think January 6th and everything leading up to it was really a profound mask off moment that is not being given nearly enough credit.

Without it, I think it might be reasonable to think that Trump would see a similar increase in numbers like he saw in 2020 from 2016.  But after J6 and ""Stop the Steal,"" I do think it's very reasonable to think his support will drop from 2020.  I will be very surprised if Trump comes out of this with more votes than he did in 2020, and I will not be surprised at all if he fails to meet his 2016 numbers.

I think this is not just prior Trump voters staying home or voting for RFK - it's also a prior Trump voters *flipping against him*.  Some portion of those who even voted for him in 2020.  Maybe not many, but every single one of them increases the gap by 2 votes in Harris' favor.

How many of those do you think Trump is going to get?  My guess is near 0 - basically just the mental breakdown / midlife crisis cohort.

How many people who voted against Trump in 2020 do you think will fail to show up to vote against him in 2024?  My guess here is also near 0.  Even if you phrase it in terms of how many people who voted for Biden do you think will stay home when it comes to Harris?  I think Harris is actually the much stronger candidate in many respects.  Why would we turn out for the mediocre candidate and not the much more competent candidate, given the same opponent who is now 4 years older?

Remember, in race 1, we both get 1 vote, and the gap is +0.  In race 2, if your 1 vote flips to me, the gap becomes +2.  Depending on this particular population, we really could enter landslide territory.  I DO think this population exists.  I think some portion of them voted for him in 2016 but didn't vote for Biden in 2020 and now will vote for Harris in 2024.  And others who voted for Trump in 2020 and will flip to Harris in 2024.

But even without any Trump supporters flipping, the fact that Trump tried to throw away the record-breaking majority of voters who turned out against him in 2020 is about to bite him in the ass, *very hard*.  This isn't 2016.  Back then, we largely didn't grasp the damage the carnival clown show could do, or the sheer incompetency and stupidity we'd be subjected to.  Some of us, of course, saw it the moment the clowns started their advertising campaign, but not nearly enough of us.

We showed up in 2020 because we wanted the clown show to end, not because we were particularly supportive of Biden.  That same motivation is still driving things, your PTSD is a testament to that fact.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

I would struggle to think of a scenario that would motivate women to vote more than having one candidate be the sex predator who took away their reproductive freedom and lied to them that it's what 'everyone' wanted, while the other would be the first female president.

I'm choosing to think of the negativity of the polls as probably a net positive in the end. Kamala has run a great campaign running like she's behind. No Democrat is staying home because they think this thing is already won. And turnout so far would seem to support that. We're breaking records in early voting in every swing state. People are voting. And it says a lot about American politics that high turnout is specifically only good for one of our political parties.

> Per intel confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter, Lawrence&#039;s itinerary kicked off with a canvass launch at the campaign field office, where she met up with Nevada Democratic regional organizing director Craig Bakerjian and a group of volunteers.

> Lawrence sat for what is described as an intimate roundtable of seven guests, including first-time voters, small business owners and local activists.

Also, you have to buy your own postcard stamps, and that costs 50 cents a pop ($250 to mail 500 postcards). So there is physical, temporal, and financial effort put forth.

Aside from following the rules correctly, there's reasons to justify not giving the win to the plurality winner.

* It's not clear who would win in a Jackson-Adams only election.
* Jackson benefitted from the 3/5ths compromise, which along with slavery was controversial.

Edit: By comparison: For Bush-Gore you could argue the Brooks Brother's riot was a criminal conspiracy by Republican operatives to get the Republican elected, and that the Supreme Court used it's power incorrectly in stopping the recount.

"I didn't write this-- I found it on reddit. And obviously it was written pre-covid. But it's a solid narrative. Enjoy.  
\---  
""I really really hope this all ends with him arranging a summit with Putin in Moscow as a ruse for him to defect. That way it will be really hard for anyone to not reconcile with the fact that he is a self-interested coward.  
Imagine Trump in Russia. For the first couple of months it‚Äôs the biggest story in the world. He does interviews on Russian State TV, talking about how the Deep State caused him to flee the Country. Insisting he's still the President.  
But then, slowly but as sure as the changing tide, fewer journalists are calling. Fewer requests for an interview. For a couple months he can still call up reporters and have what he says to them be newsworthy. But eventually they stop returning his calls. America and the world has moved on. He was a blip, a flash in the pan. He exposed deep wounds that the American people need to address. But he was a complication, not the original infection.  
No one really wants to know what he has to say anymore. Because no one cares.  
He's now truly alone. In reality he has always been alone. He just hadn't realized it. Now he has regular contact with no one but his FSB bodyguards/handlers. He's stuck in a golden prison of his own making. He lives next to Yanukovych. But Viktor, being Ukrainian knows the culture and the language. Trump is never able to master anything but the ability to mumble some words that border on the incomprehensible in the language.  
His days are spent in a unexceptional (in his eyes), dacha on the black sea. He's never far from the ever present sight of Russian Security Services. He lives off a modest Kremlin funded stipend. But domestic pressure is building on the United Russia Party to scale it back. He has no income of his own anymore. His assets are frozen and seized around the World.  
His children are indicted. He didn't tell them of his plans to flee beforehand and they were as surprised as anyone. But, perhaps for the first time in their lives, Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric feel the curious absence of a pressure they can't explain. At first they can't figure it out. They each face years in prison yet they have never felt more free. They confide in each other and they soon realize that the weight lifted from their souls is that of their father.  
Free from his domineering presence they all plea to lesser charges. Putting the blame squarely on the narcissistic father whose ""Stockholm Syndrome"" like grip on them is slipping. They are sentenced. Don Jr. gets 18 months in Federal Prison. Ivanka and Jared are sentenced to staggered 12 month sentences. Eric cooperates fully and is not charged.  
They are forbidden from contacting their father as part of their plea agreements. But they have no such desires. They don't care.  
Melania files for divorce almost immediately after his flight. She gains full custody of Barron in uncontested hearings. Her and her son are slowly spending more and more time in Slovenia. Eventually they relocate permanently. Melania and Barron split their time between Ljubljana and the French Riviera. Very sparingly visiting the States anymore. Her autobiography detailing the mental, emotional, and at times physical abuse she suffered becomes an international best seller. Trump's American passport has long since been revoked and the Slovene Government, as well as the EU, bans him from entry into the Schengen Area. He never sees, much less talks to them, again  
Trump becomes increasingly paranoid. He frequently tears his dacha apart looking for listening devices planted by Mossad, the Democrats, CIA, MI6 or whatever globalist conspiracy is hunting him this week. Soon he has no use for the teenage sex workers he has always fancied. Never having been a drinker, food becomes his only vice. He begins to put on weight. A lot of weight. As he slips into morbid obesity he nears 355 pounds.  
He very often rants and raves at his bodyguards. His tenuous grip on reality is slipping. Some days he doesn't seem to know where he is. He is borderline catatonic on occasion. Spending days in his bedroom suite without leaving, only to eventually emerge in a fresh, albeit cheap and ill-fitting, suit. His wispy hair, long kept alive by the marvels of modern hair care technology, perfectly coiffed. During these fleeting moments of seeming sanity, he doesn't seem to remember much of the last decades. Believing himself to still be a pompous fixture of the New York real estate scene. He once even asked his handlers how the New Jersey Generals were fairing this season.  
But within two or three days he is once again disheveled and ranting about the Deep State. His speech becoming more slurred and incomprehensible by the year. A series of strokes leaves his body partially paralyzed on one side. He now requires round the clock nursing. Incontinence soon follows.  
Eventually he's found on the floor of his dacha, face down in a puddle of his own vomit. He is discovered by the morning nurse as she begins her shift. His breathing is slow, his heart rate is faint. He never again regains consciousness. He looks to have collapsed at some point in the night. During a mad, partially paralyzed slog to the bathroom in a vain attempt to avoid soiling his bed once again.  
The official cause of death is a heart attack. Which is likely true but having outlived his usefulness, the Russian government has long since seen him as an embarrassing liability. His asylum has been a sticking point in relations with the West for years and conspiracy theories alleging his assassination at the hands of the FSB or CIA abound.  
The Russians offer to repatriate his remains. Although his family, while not outright refusing, is lukewarm to the prospect. They have moved on. Barron and Tiffany don't even use his surname anymore. Unable to find a solution, the Russians bury him in a modest grave. It was originally planned to be temporary but a long term solution never comes to fruition. Before too long everyone has forgotten.  
In death he remains infamous. His name uttered in the same breath as other embarrassing episodes of American History. Although more as the butt of ridicule and scorn. After all, it's not like he was even competent enough get the country into a real disaster such as Vietnam or the Iraq War.  
In US History textbooks he is relegated to a few paragraphs. Not more than half a page. He's brought up in conjunction with a wider discussion on the Political gridlock of the late 2000s, 2010s and early 20s. In the end, he is nothing more than the answer to a few multiple choice questions on an 11th Grade History Final. His legacy once seemed destined to be that of a pompous, arrogant game show host and real estate fraudster. Nothing but a textbook example of that which one would describe as ""tacky"".  
Now he is simply: ""What was the name of the President who's often xenophobic campaign and subsequent election highlighted the deep political divisions of the late 2010s?""

"That precedent is flawed, though.

A) I've written about this elsewhere in the last month or so, but I can't find the comment now. In any event, the very short version of it was that while the *enlisted* might lean right, and have quite a few hard-righters in the ranks, the *officers* are more specifically educated in military history and military law as it relates to their duties and responsibility to the US Constitution. 

I got to pick the brains of quite a few mid-level officers who are, by now, among the very senior of the operational-level officers and lower-level Admirals. Almost universally, the takeaway I got was that the officers decidedly did *not* approve and appreciate Trump, at least in relation to his activities around the military. So many of his policies were slow-rolled to death, waiting out his vacating the office of the Presidency.

B) The Civil War was very much a war of geographical concerns - North vs South. It's much more muddled now - with the exception of the National Guard, there aren't units made up entirely of Minnesotans or Kansans. Soldiers from California fight and train side-by-side with soldiers from North Dakota. And since the services shuttle people all over the place, all the time, there is no real ability to build up any kind of certainty of building up a critical mass of like-minded people.

C) In the same vein as B above, the infrastructure and tools required are *extremely* different between the Civil War and now. Not just in the actual equipment, but also the scale of logistics. In theory, you *could* have a unit break away - and within just a few weeks their equipment will have broken down and be nearly worthless because where are they getting their replacement parts from? Where are they getting their fuel from?

In the Civil War, arms were quite regularly provided by the soldiers themselves - at least the basics, and especially for the separatists. Horses were plentiful, and grass was everywhere to feed them - and they could always purchase food from a sympathetic farmer. Cannon and shot were a big deal, of course, but war could still be fought without it.

I've worked on equipment that needed replacement parts *every day* - and good luck getting those parts of the DOD calls up the one government contractor that supplies the parts and says, ""Shut it the *fuck* down, right now, to <*insert breakaway unit here*>."" 

Bottom line - there's too many reasons for the military to stay the fuck out of this, and possibly even work *against* Trump. There's almost no real way for more than a handful of dissidents to break away from the military, and they're certainly not going to have the equivalent of the South's General Staff to help legitimize the effort.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Three of those were placed outside of my workplace. Somebody took them all down as they should because its not a political sign for a person. Its just promoting a terrorist group.

So i say all of that to also tell other NC voters to please turn this fucking state ONCE AGAIN. Those people are the ones that support Trump. The Republicans that keep getting re-elected every year do not do anything to benefit the average North Carolinian. The NC GOP has sought to tale away women‚Äôs rights, they have refused to increase the state‚Äôs minimum wage while prices keep inflating, they are why we rank the lowest in worker rights, the reason why nothing can get accomplished. They have gerrymandered this state and fucked everybody here and groups like Patriotic Front are who supports the NC GOP. 

Rant done. Fuck the NCGOP. Wake me up when they actually do something for the people besides fucking us daily",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Honestly, what's ridiculous is he still has supporters that are not white racists or religious nuts.

The guy has effectively insulted minorities/people of color of all types. The only ones he really hasn't insulted are white people.

He's committed fraud.

He's misogynistic and has treated women like crap.

He's committed treason.

He doesn't live up to any moral ideals of Christianity.

He's ripped off the people who work for him.

He's insulted veterans, POWs, members of the military. 

He's taken secret, classified information and likely has disclosed or discussed with people he shouldn't about sensitive information.   

And there's more stuff that should have made anyone that's not a white racists say, no thanks.

Anyone who is religious/nonreligious, patriotic, decent, human being would consider what he's done (compared to his opponent) as inferior.

> According to Miles Taylor, a top Homeland Security official who accompanied Trump to Puerto Rico the month after the hurricane, Trump referred to Puerto Rico as &quot;Dirty&quot; and &quot;Poor&quot; and suggested the U.S. swap it for Greenland.

> The question is: Will Puerto Rican voters, including about 100,000 registered in North Carolina, make Trump pay a price this year for that long history of insults?

"I believe the reasons why ‚Äúmoral character‚Äù stopped being a deciding factor for leadership and the presidency are twofold:

Evangelicals:  

We have a few things to thank for Trump‚Äôs rise in the Evangelical community, who were not supportive of Trump until Jerry Falwell, Jr. came out with a strong endorsement. Of course, later we learned the truth. Jerry Falwell, Jr., the former Evangelical Liberty University President, accepted an offer from Michael Cohen and Donald Trump to bury his threesome sex scandal between himself, his wife, and the 20 year old poolboy, in exchange for Falwell promoting Trump with Evangelicals to help him win the election. You cannot make this up.

Evangelicals also threw their values under the bus in exchange for conservative Supreme Court justices and the chance to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Fast-forward to today, and women are suffering severe medical complications and dying as a direct consequence of Trump being elected.  Evangelicals are going to need to answer for Trump‚Äôs presidency someday.  

Billionaires: 

Then you have billionaires. We saw the likes of Jeff Bezos fold like a cheap suit when he told Washington Post not to endorse Harris. Then there‚Äôs Elon Musk spending millions of dollars to help elect Trump, no doubt because he thinks it will be financially advantageous. But these billionaires are making a Faustian bargain.  Trump‚Äôs loyalty is a one-way street. For CEOs of corporations, who care only about profits, morals are not in the equation. They want more tax cuts and Trump has promised more tax cuts and more money in their pockets, shifting more wealth to the top and increasing inequality. 

There is a direct line between massive inequality and the rise of far right populism. Politicians are great at distractions, pointing the finger at immigrants, instead of addressing the real issues at hand. Of course, the extreme example of that is the economic and political instability in the late 1920s and early 1930s that played a role in helping the Nazis rise to power.

Just as Trump‚Äôs attempt to stop the peaceful transition of power on January 6, the Nazis had a failed coup d'√©tat in 1923.  They were not held accountable, and in 1933, Hitler came into power.

Similar to Project 2025, the Nazi‚Äôs Enabling Act of 1933 allowed the Chancellor, Adolf Hitler, to bypass the system of checks and balances in the government. As John Oliver explained in a segment on Project 2025, their plan for the separation of powers is a game of rock, paper, scissors, except rock crushes paper and scissors every single time.

Just as Trump has promised to go after political enemies, Hitler and the Nazis declared a state of emergency through the Reichstag Fire Decree and began a violent crackdown against political enemies.

For those who think a right wing extremist movement cannot happen in America, one only need to watch video of the January 6 attack and the documentary, A Night at the Garden, to know that it can. Watching Trump speak at Madison Square Garden, with the vile, hateful comments he made, was surreal in light of this history and his escalating violent rhetoric. Vote for a positive path going forward.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"I think this comes from facts not mattering, because every side now has their own ""facts"" which are propagated and supported by their own ""institutions"" (e.g. CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, News Max).

Because moral quality does matter. Most of Trump's followers aren't holding their noses voting for the man -- they're completely dedicated to him and think Biden/Harris as corrupt, weak, evil. In fact, it's quintessentially framed as a battle of good vs. evil on both sides.

The inability to really digest Trump as a convicted felon and rapist, for hiding classified documents in his Maralago resort, for supporting dictators, for mocking disabled persons and fallen soldiers.. all of this stem from the growth and presence of institutions that offer alternative facts. 

And most of it can be traced to various legal rulings that allowed Fox News to propagate alternative facts under the guise of ""entertainment"", and then today the various alt right far right children it has spawned.

It's a post-truth society now.

"I‚Äôm by no means a Nixon apologist or a G*P sympathizer, but I disagree. 

I believe that Ford was dealt a bad hand and played it the best he could. The scandal was more or less politically ‚Äòsettled‚Äô after Nixon willingly fucked off to avoid a senate conviction. The country needed to move on, and a proper trial that would drag on for years was not the ideal course of events, considering the turbulent time that was the mid to late 70s.  

Ford inherited an administration plagued by Watergate, the inglorious end to the war in Vietnam, the worst recession since the Great Depression, and the worst inflation in U.S. history. 

In his efforts to deal with inflation, unemployment, and the energy crisis, he had switched policies several times. As a result, Republican liberals felt he was too conservative, and conservatives felt he was too liberal. He was the nominee of a party that could claim the loyalty of only about 20 percent of the electorate, and he had no regional base of support. 

He was in a prime position for the Democratic party to run circles around him. It was Carter who had implemented a ‚Äúsouthern strategy‚Äù in ‚Äò76, though I say this without the racist connotations of the term. The man just recognized that the south was up for grabs, and begging for a clean swipe. When the returns were in, it was clear that Carter‚Äôs strategy had paid off. The Solid South except Virginia had returned to the Dems for the first time since 1960.

It also helps that the bible does not even indirectly forbid abortion, and instead seems to lean on the side of supporting it by inference. The irony for me is that Christians have hitched their entire moral system to a thing that the bible does not forbid, and then subordinated all the things the Bible *does* command or forbid to their imaginary rule.

It is, without a doubt, a heresy under the orthodox understanding of scripture.

Seriously, one can spend weeks trying to tease out some sort of anti-abortion interpretation of scripture that largely requires you to ignore certain scriptures and then take other ones completely out of *both* their cultural and literary context, and ultimately fail to come up with anything compelling. But if you spend two seconds trying to figure out how you should treat immigrants, the result is clear and exeedingly obvious. And yet Christians go the *exact* opposite way with immigrants, valuing our money over their lives.

"Fluoride in drinking water is considered important because it helps prevent tooth decay, especially in children. When fluoride is added to water, it strengthens tooth enamel, making teeth more resistant to cavities. This process, known as fluoridation, has been studied for over 70 years and is supported by organizations like the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Both report that communities with fluoridated water have seen a significant drop in dental cavities, which can lead to fewer dental problems and costs over a lifetime.

Here are some well-researched articles and studies that support the continued use of fluoride in drinking water:

	1.	‚ÄúWater Fluoridation and Dental Caries in U.S. Children and Adolescents‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Published in the Journal of Dental Research, this study shows a clear link between fluoridated water and reduced cavities in children.
	
	2.	‚ÄúCommunity Water Fluoridation: A Review of Its Health Effects and Risks‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	This review published in the Public Health Reports discusses the benefits of fluoridation, including fewer cavities and improved oral health, while outlining the safe levels set by health organizations.

	3.	‚ÄúEconomic Evaluation of Community Water Fluoridation: A Community Guide Systematic Review‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Published by the CDC, this systematic review shows that fluoridation is cost-effective for preventing cavities, making it beneficial for communities with limited access to dental care.
	

The Opposing View

Some research suggests that fluoride might have negative effects if consumed in very high levels, though these levels are much higher than those in community water systems. Critics argue that fluoride could potentially cause health issues, such as dental fluorosis (a cosmetic issue causing white spots on teeth), and raise concerns about possible effects on the brain.

	1.	‚ÄúDevelopmental Fluoride Neurotoxicity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	This study published in Environmental Health Perspectives reviewed the impact of fluoride on children‚Äôs IQ in areas with high fluoride levels (often above recommended levels). It‚Äôs important to note that these levels are typically much higher than what‚Äôs found in U.S. water systems.
	
	2.	‚ÄúFluoride Exposure and Kidney and Liver Function among Adolescents in the United States‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Published in Environment International, this study examined fluoride exposure and its potential effects on kidney and liver health. Again, the findings are relevant primarily in cases of high fluoride levels, not those commonly found in regulated water supplies.
	

Overall, the general consensus among public health organizations is that fluoride in water at regulated levels is safe and beneficial for dental health, while higher-than-recommended levels may pose risks.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"This movement comes from a fundamental lack of understanding of the difference between correlation and causation.

There are research studies which show that counties which put more fluoride in their water on average have lower IQs, which is true. For some people that's all they needed to hear; they assume that the IQs are lower because of the higher levels of fluoride. 

What they don't consider is WHY those higher levels of fluoride were instituted in the first place. Areas with a lower standard of education have fewer people going to medical school, so they have fewer dentists. As a stopgap against widespread tooth decay, they increased the amount of fluoride in the water.

So really it's the opposite; fluoride is higher because the IQs were already lower.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"This is a tricky one because fluoridated water/ingestion is one of the least studied public health policies out there. The more studies come out, the more apparent it is that higher than *average* consumption is likely quite bad, and that we need to study in depth both higher consumption levels but also normal consumption levels. Fluoride definitely acts topically, and there are plenty of studies showing that fluoridated toothpaste works great. **The idea that fluoride might work systemically without significant side effects is scientific conjecture - it simply hasn't been studied in that regard.** And recent studies point to the need to study exactly that.

So an administration that makes health policy based on science would push for this to be studied in depth, which should have been in the works for decades. It's a real problem for a crazy person to say this because a lot of people will have the knee-jerk reaction that they are absolutely wrong. But in this case, scientifically, that can't be determined either way, though evidence shows a real need to study this in more depth because we currently don't know. 

As for my family, we'll continue *not* drinking fluoridated water and continue brushing with fluoridated toothpaste, and ignore any health advice coming from political nutjobs. Our kids have zero cavities/fillings by the way. 

There's also the sad fact that 25% of US kids literally don't drink any plain water during an average day, so even if it turns out to be systemically effective without side effects, it's lost on a lot of people.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

The answer largely boils down to how the fluoridation helps fight tooth decay. It‚Äôs not doing so by direct surface application when it‚Äôs taken into the body, it‚Äôs done by absorption of fluoride into the body, which is then released in the form  of fluoride ions in the saliva over the course of time. To have the same effect, you have to be pretty much constantly using mouthwash and brushing your teeth a dozen or more times over the course of the day, or be swallowing mouthwash and toothpaste at a pretty good clip. 


If *all* you‚Äôre drinking is unadulterated spring water, then yeah, toothpaste and mouthwash will help, but remember that pretty much all fountain beverages are made with tap, same with brewed coffee and tea, and the water for soups, and everything else, is almost certainly using tap water, which is fluoridated. 


Putting fluoride in toothpaste and mouthwash helps, but not significantly compared to fluoridated water, it‚Äôs mostly a marketing gimmick by the manufacturers.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Fluoride in toothpaste is great but very young children can't use toothpaste with fluoride in it because the concentration is too high for ingestion. The recommended fluoride concentration in drinking water (also called the optimal level) is 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/index.html)) which is 0.0007%. Toothpaste generally has about 0.15% fluoride so that would be *significantly* (200+ times) higher. Young children swallow a lot of the toothpaste they use. This is why ""training toothpaste"" is a thing, it has no fluoride and lets kids practice brushing until they learn how to brush without swallowing the toothpaste.  

Putting fluoride in water in a safe to consume concentration allows these young children to get the benefits of fluoride without the risks of consuming too much. 

I think it's also worth noting that some water has naturally occurring fluoride and the guidelines on fluoridated water actually prompted communities to *reduce* the amount of fluoride in their water to match the recommended level.

If you're an adult who drinks bottled water but brushes with fluoride toothpaste twice a day, you're probably fine. Just make sure you do NOT rinse the toothpaste away. Spit but don't rinse. Let the fluoride do its job. :)",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"I‚Äôm pasting the beginning and the end, and will get to the middle:)

Beginning:

‚ÄúJeannie Gaffigan is an actress, producer, writer, philanthropist, mother of five and all around comedic force. She is most well-known for the comedy empire she created with her writing, producing partner, and husband, Jim Gaffigan, and is a New York Times Bestseller for her book, When Life gives You Pears.

A lot has happened in my life as a Catholic mother over the past four years, the main event being that four of my five kids are now teenagers, which has me in crisis mode most of the time. As I struggle to keep my children from falling off the boat, I have managed to avoid navigating the turbulent waters of the political scene. But alas, time flies by, and here we are on the cusp of a presidential election.

When I pulled my head out of stalking my kids‚Äô secret social media accounts, I could not suppress my shock and alarm about how little has changed in the world despite their evolving into highly intelligent life forms capable of outsmarting me. I wish my nature was as gentle as it used to be, but I‚Äôve become hardened by the scrapes and bruises of traversing a teenage wasteland. In the past, I might have written this essay asking fellow faithful Catholics to examine their consciences and figure out how we can best align our voting choices with our values, but instead, I will say only this: 

*As a Catholic, I simply cannot in good conscience vote for Donald Trump.‚Äù*",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Ending:

‚ÄúAs Election Day approaches, I call on my Catholic brothers and sisters to take a second look at what drives us to support Donald Trump. Do we genuinely believe that he leads in a way consistent with our most cherished principles? Or are we backing him out of fear? I have a hard time seeing how you can support a guy who is so evidently a bull in the china shop of democracy and who shows so little regard for so many lives‚Äîespecially the most vulnerable, who we are called to see as God‚Äôs image and likeness. I just can‚Äôt see how following that path would lead to any good for democracy, for equality, for the church or for the lives we see as especially precious.

Let‚Äôs call for leaders who embody the principles of our faith. This faith calls us to care for the marginalized and to uphold the dignity of every person. It calls us to work for a future that is rooted in love and justice. It calls us to insist on leadership that aligns with the values we hold sacred. While we are going to continue to advocate for the dignity of the unborn, let‚Äôs admit Ms. Harris has Catholic cred on other important issues:

* Advocating for policies that support working families, a big deal in Catholic social teaching? Check.¬†
* Affordable health care? Check.¬†
* Family leave? Yes, please.¬†
* Her focus on environmental issues aligns nicely with Pope Francis‚Äô call to care for our common home in ‚ÄúLaudato Si‚Äô.‚Äù¬†
* And on immigration, even though her primary campaign message on this has been cracking down on asylum claims, she‚Äôs been firm about providing humane policies and a pathway to citizenship, which the Catholic Church has long supported.‚Äù

1,437,304 democrats voted
1,478,761 Republicans
1,492,799 independents


If we assume all democrats voted for Harris, 10% of Republicans, and half of independents which should be accurate give or take just based off gender.


1,437,304 + 0.1(1,478,761) + 0.5(1,492,799) = 2,331,580 Harris votes


Taking out the Republicans and Independents remaining


2,331,580 - 0.9(1,478,761)-0.5(1,492,799) = 254,295 votes Harris is up by.


There's about 900,000 R voters left, 1,000,000 democrats voters, and 1.5 million independent.


Assuming 80% of the remaining voters vote that totals. 2,720,000 voters left.


He should need to get around [0.5(2,720,000) + 254,295]/2,720,000 = 59% of the remaining vote on election day. Not impossible but hard and why he's spending extra time here.

Trump Says ‚ÄòI Don‚Äôt Mind‚Äô if the Media Gets Shot
Peter Wade
November 3, 2024

At the beginning of his first rally on Sunday, said, ‚ÄúI love being off these stupid teleprompters because the truth comes out.‚Äù That statement was an omen of what was to come when if a would-be assassin had to ‚Äúshoot through‚Äù members of the media in an attempt to kill him.

‚ÄúI have a piece of glass over here,‚Äù Trump said during a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, pointing to his far right. Since the assassination attempt against Trump in July, both he and Vice President Kamala Harris have spoken behind panels of bulletproof glass as a safety measure.

‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt have a piece of glass there,‚Äù Trump added, pointing between the panes of glass.

‚ÄúI have this piece of glass here,‚Äù Trump continued, pointing forward. ‚ÄúBut all we really have over here is the fake news, right?‚Äù The crowd laughed.

‚ÄúAnd, to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don‚Äôt mind that so much. I don‚Äôt mind. I don‚Äôt mind that,‚Äù he said.


As , ‚ÄúThe riser facing [Trump] head-on is full of reporters and cameras.‚Äù

The former president then breezed by essentially wishing death upon reporters and camera operators, likely including employees of outlets that are friendly to him, and started to talk about how the glass means he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúlook great on television.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo I have a piece of glass,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand the problem with the glass is I don‚Äôt look great on television when you have a four-inch piece of glass that a Howitzer can‚Äôt go through. When you see yourself on television, you say‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre really not very recognizable to be honest with you, which is good.‚Äù (Trump is, in fact, extremely recognizable, in part because of .)

Even though Trump quickly moved on from his dangerous remarks, it‚Äôs important to point out his threatening rhetoric for what it is: a call to violence.

The Trump campaign released a statement following the former president‚Äôs remarks, making a pathetic attempt at rewriting history: ‚ÄúPresident Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the Media constantly talks and jokes about,‚Äù Trump Communications Director Steven Cheung wrote. ‚ÄúThe President‚Äôs statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else. It was about threats against him that were spurred on by dangerous rhetoric from Democrats. In fact, President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also. There can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!‚Äù

During the rally, Trump also commented that he ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt have left office‚Äù after he lost the 2020 election. ‚ÄúIt said we had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have left, I mean, honestly.‚Äù He then continued, ‚ÄúWe did so well, we had such a great‚Äî‚Äù but stopped short. He then said, ‚ÄúSo now, every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there.‚Äù

As The New York Times pointed out (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/trump-pa-rally-election.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes), Trump repeatedly said at the end of his term that he was not going to leave. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not going to leave,‚Äù he told one aide. Another aide heard Trump say, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre never leaving‚Ä¶ How can you leave when you won an election?‚Äù

"> Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.

I saw a comment a while ago saying that the discourse around Biden and Trump is showing who's spent time around dementia patients and who hasn't. Biden reminds me of my 85 year old dad, he's clearly older, slower, and can't be trusted to run the country for another 4 years, but he's still there. Trump reminds me much more of my Grandma, who got less patient and angrier as her memory deteriorated, well before we could tell.

I'm not *positive* Trump has dementia, nor am I positive Biden doesn't, though it's obvious that neither are the same as they were eight or even four years ago. But if I had to bet on one, it'd be Trump in a heartbeat. Blustering loudly is actually a really common way for people with dementia to try to hide it, and since Trump has a preternatural knack for bluster, it'd be easy for decline to go relatively unnoticed.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

And it‚Äôs not just old men. We had an old woman who was a total sweetheart, but she masturbated anywhere and everywhere. She also had the hots for one of our male CNAs, and that was super awkward for him. Another lady was NOT a super sweetheart, but she had a thing for a young male CNA. She once had him verbally trapped, and he looked at me and mouthed ‚ÄúHELP ME!‚Äù I had to make up an excuse that I really needed his help so he could extricate himself.

"For what it‚Äôs worth, dementia is not slipping into blissful ignorance and living your days out peacefully. It is a scary process for everyone involved, but especially the dementia sufferer. At many times, it means being in constant fear.

That fear coupled with lack of comprehension causes a person to lash out at everyone around them. It basically reverts their reasoning to a toddler‚Äôs, so they only know the most basic of emotions, and get instantly cranky when they don‚Äôt get their way.

What we‚Äôre seeing with Trump: the ataxia, slurred speech, listless expressions and violent anger at the most minor inconveniences (like the permanent microphone stand on a podium not being at his preferred height); these are all very strong indicators that The Dump is actively experiencing dementia.

This bag of poo is having a miserable time, and everyone propping him up is as well. Dementia is not a free pass from his sins; if anything, it‚Äôs the only real consequence he‚Äôs seen in his entire life.

As someone who wanted to die many, many times because of the laws his people have pushed, and also as someone who has lost their whole family to his evil cult, I hope the suffering is as drawn out as possible.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"A dozen Black canvassers were tricked, threatened, and driven in seatless U-Haul vans. They were fired en masse after WIRED reported on their plight‚Äîwithout full pay or a way back home.

This comes after the canvassers and paid door knockers for Donald Trump, contracted by a firm associated with America PAC, told WIRED they were subjected to poor working conditions: A number of them have been driven around in the back of a seatless U-Haul van, according to video obtained by WIRED, and threatened that their lodging at a local motel wouldn‚Äôt be paid for if they didn‚Äôt meet canvassing quotas. Tyra Muldrow, one of the canvassers who has since been fired said she didn‚Äôt even know they were signing up for anything to do with Musk or Trump.

"‚ÄùMuldrow and the rest of her canvassing group of roughly a dozen people had just been fired en masse, after¬†[WIRED reported](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-america-pac-blitz-canvassing-michigan-uhaul/)¬†that they had been tricked and threatened as part of Musk‚Äôs get-out-the-vote effort. Speaking publicly for the first time about her ordeal, Muldrow says that the canvassers in her group were fired with little explanation beyond a complaint that someone had spoken with the press. Many, including her, were still owed money. Muldrow had to find her own way home; others are still stranded in Michigan.

A representative for Musk and America PAC did not return a request for comment.

On October 15, Muldrow‚Äôs cousin Ebony Jones recruited her for the job, offering upwards of $2,000 per week and a return flight, per emails reviewed by WIRED. Muldrow signed a nondisclosure agreement the same day, and was then flown to Michigan on October 18 as part of a campaign for Blitz Canvassing, a subcontractor which had¬†[received more than $9 million from America PAC](https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00879510/1844622/se)¬†for presidential campaign canvassing as of October 29. Only upon her arrival in Michigan did Muldrow realize what this job would really entail: canvassing for Trump.

No one in her group of contractors‚Äîreferred to internally as a ‚Äúcell‚Äù‚Äîhad a driver‚Äôs license. They were initially transported via Ubers, and were then driven back and forth for nearly two weeks in a pair of seatless U-Haul vans between their targeted neighborhoods, staying in a series of motels and AirBnBs in the Detroit suburbs of Warren, Livonia, and Mount Clemens.‚Äú

> Speaking publicly for the first time about her ordeal, Muldrow says that the canvassers in her group were fired with little explanation beyond a complaint that someone had spoken with the press.

> Muldrow had to find her own way home; others are still stranded in Michigan.

> On October 15, Muldrow&#039;s cousin Ebony Jones recruited her for the job, offering upwards of $2,000 per week and a return flight, per emails reviewed by WIRED. Muldrow signed a nondisclosure agreement the same day, and was then flown to Michigan on October 18 as part of a campaign for Blitz Canvassing, a subcontractor which had received more than $9 million from America PAC for presidential campaign canvassing as of October 29.

> The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and its subsequent reauthorizations recognize and define two primary forms of human trafficking:

"I hate titles like this.  It absolutely does not point to a Harris landslide.  It points to Harris possibly winning Iowa within the margin of error.  It doesn't apply, at all, to other states, the popular vote, or in particular the electoral college vote.

That said, it doesn't mean positive moves in Iowa won't be reflected elsewhere, but it's *possible* the changes in Iowa will be reflected elsewhere.  The Bulwark podcast had Anne Seltzer on today which gives a good overview of the poll.  The most promising aspect is that there was a sizable swing in older female voters from Trump to Harris (which is probably why Harris has been courting moderate Republicans quite heavily), what's most impressive is that move was done without either candidate doing much in the way of advertising in the state.  The other reason is in Iowa there was anti-abortion legislation that recently passed so female voters in particular are motivated to vote.  That also applies in some other states but not all, though the right to to manage their own healthcare is obviously the huge issue with female voters this time around.

All that's to say it's still likely to be very, very close.  I hope Harris blows Trump out of the water on both the EC and the popular vote, but what goes in Iowa doesn't necessarily go anywhere else (except maybe Wisconsin to a degree).",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Hillary made it through the primaries as the appointed nominee but the consistent unexpected success of a token challenge from Bernie Sanders hinted that a lot of voters weren‚Äôt happy with her as nominee.

The polls consistently showed her as ahead until a couple of ones in October showed warning signs that her support was slipping. An October surprise reminded a lot of voters about what they didn‚Äôt like about her and they stayed home or switched to her opponent. 

Trump has played out an echo of the same thing. The GOP primaries hinted at a potentially devastating divide in the GOP. He did well in the first debate and thought he was cruising to an easy victory. Then everything since September onwards has reminded voters why they don‚Äôt like him and booted him back in 2020.

2008 - Obama +17 (+9)

~~2004 - Bush +3 (+0.7%)~~

**2004 - Kerry +5 (Bush won 49.9% - 49.2%)**

(EDIT - I was wrong on 2004, she missed that one)

She has been very accurate, with the exception of 2008 with Obama (*EDIT -- and missed the call for 2004, my original comment was wrong*). She did correctly predict Obama's victory in Iowa that election, but she was off by 8 points.

I sure hope she keeps her streak. It would be a stunning reversal for Trump in the state to win it by 8 and 9 points in the prior two elections, only to lose this year. The hope is that the difference this year compared to 4 years ago isn't so much party-switchers, but motivating new voters to the polls, especially older women who weren't reliable voters in the past.

"Yeah but margin of error for a lead works differently than the margin of error for gauge of support. 

So using your example, if we asked people if they preferred red or blue, and we got 55% red and 45% blue and the margin of error for a single color is 5%, that means we expect 50-60% support for red 95% of the time. 

However, the margin of error for the lead of Red vs Blue would be double than the margin of error for individual support. Since it follows that if you overestimated one colors share, you underestimated the other colors share. 

So if it‚Äôs 5% for individual support, then the margin of error for the lead is 10% in each direction. So the lead for red can be as much as much as +20 or it can be a tie. If the margin of the lead does not contain 0, then it usually means it‚Äôs statistically reliable, if it does contain 0, then it might be due to sampling. 

So the margin of error for Kamala‚Äôs lead in this poll is 6.8%. So she could be ahead as much as 9.8 or only trailing as much by -3.8. Even if the poll is within that margin of error for her lead, Trump leading by just 3.8% in a non-swing state, which he won by about 10% each time before, it looks promising.

"Statistician here! Thing to remember -- states don't exist in total isolation. State boundaries are basically imaginary lines. People in Iowa really aren't terribly different from people in Texas. Sure there are things like the urban/rural divide that result in places like California being _really_ blue or Alabama _really_ red, but in general, whatever variables are dragging one state in a direction will frequently drag other states in the same direction.

Case in point, in 2016, the entire country got redder. Even though Clinton got more votes, she got them in the wrong places, specifically in large urban places. She ran a bad campaign and she lacked the enthusiasm of the Trump campaign, and more first time voters and low propensity voters broke for Trump.

Now, I'm sure there are plenty of reasons to speculate exactly _why_ the country seems to be getting bluer, but if the Seltzer report is to be believed, Iowa has experienced an 11 point shift towards Harris. That would mean she's all but certain to clench the swing states, and we should expect that other ""lean Republican"" states to flip as well.

Now to actually get to the point I'm trying to make. Trump won Iowa by 8 points in 2020. He won Texas by 5.5 (and by 9 points in 2016). Texas is getting bluer anyway due to shifting demographics, but if that Iowa polling shift translates to votes, Texas would only need _half_ of that shift to flip to Harris.

If a normally red state like Iowa is polling a +3 Harris victory, then a normally swing state like PA should be polling a solid Harris victory.

"I hope you heard him this weekend 

He said - When I heard the death toll after Helene I knew it was going to be bad for the election. 

He means VP Harris. 

Look at who voted against FEMA funding before the hurricane, his MAGA members of congress. Most likely because he knew if a hurricane was big enough to cause damage it would ‚Äúbe bad for the Democrats‚Äù. However that meant putting FL, GA, NC, SC, TN, and VA in harms way. That meant letting some republicans die, letting Republican towns get destroyed, letting republican businesses get washed away, letting history and family farms be destroyed to gain some election points. 

Then President Biden asked to get money because the damage was done and historic and without it more people will suffer. Americans will suffer. Speaker Mike Johnson (R) said no. 

Knowing another hurricane is inbound to the Republican stronghold of FL Biden again makes a request and is denied. The MAGA party is telling people President Biden controls the weather and is targeting red states. If true they made no effort to force Speaker Johnson to vote for more money for FEMA as a historic disaster threatened FL. Likely because if one disaster was good for the election then two is great.

> ‚ÄúThe new political philosophy must be defined by us [conservatives] in moral terms, packaged in non-religious language, and propagated throughout the country by our new coalition,‚Äù Weyrich wrote in the mid-1970s. ‚ÄúWhen political power is achieved, the moral majority will have the opportunity to re-create this great nation.‚Äù Weyrich believed that the political possibilities of such a coalition were unlimited. ‚ÄúThe leadership, moral philosophy, and workable vehicle are at hand just waiting to be blended and activated,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIf the moral majority acts, results could well exceed our wildest dreams.‚Äù
>
> But this hypothetical ‚Äúmoral majority‚Äù needed a catalyst‚Äîa standard around which to rally. For nearly two decades, Weyrich, by his own account, had been trying out different issues, hoping one might pique evangelical interest: pornography, prayer in schools, the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, even abortion. ‚ÄúI was trying to get these people interested in those issues and I utterly failed,‚Äù Weyrich recalled at a conference in 1990.
>
> Weyrich, Falwell and leaders of the emerging religious right enlisted an unlikely ally in their quest to advance abortion as a political issue: Francis A. Schaeffer‚Äîa goateed, knickers-wearing theologian who was warning about the eclipse of Christian values and the advance of something he called ‚Äúsecular humanism.‚Äù Schaeffer, considered by many the intellectual godfather of the religious right, was not known for his political activism, but by the late 1970s he decided that legalized abortion would lead inevitably to infanticide and euthanasia, and he was eager to sound the alarm.
>
> Schaeffer teamed with a pediatric surgeon, C. Everett Koop, to produce a series of films entitled ‚ÄúWhatever Happened to the Human Race?‚Äù In the early months of 1979, Schaeffer and Koop, targeting an evangelical audience, toured the country with these films, which depicted the scourge of abortion in graphic terms‚Äîmost memorably with a scene of plastic baby dolls strewn along the shores of the Dead Sea. Schaeffer and Koop argued that any society that countenanced abortion was captive to ‚Äúsecular humanism‚Äù and therefore caught in a vortex of moral decay.

">I don't need to google things.

Maybe you should because the inflation data is particularly embarrassing for Trump.

Inflation started going through the charts basically as soon as Biden stepped into office.  It very clearly did *not* have actually have anything to do with Biden.  How could it?  It began its crazy upward journey in January 2021.  He wasn't even president until the January 6th.

It's very obviously the result of Trump administration policy and legislation.  The data is very clear on this.

It reaches its peak some time around June 2022, and then it starts dropping back to previous levels, where it likely would have been had it not started to spike like it did.

The graphs genuinely look like someone set fire to things right before leaving and the Biden administration came in with a fire extinguisher.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Look, I get where you‚Äôre coming from, but there are some things to consider. Obama inherited an economy in freefall and managed to turn it around with steady job growth and recovery. Trump came into office with that momentum already in place, yet his policies‚Äîlike tax cuts that mostly benefited the wealthy‚Äîled to a bigger national debt. And then there‚Äôs his trade war with China, which actually hurt American farmers and businesses more than it helped.

When Biden took over, he faced an economy wrecked by both the pandemic and some of Trump‚Äôs decisions, yet we‚Äôve managed to avoid a recession so far. Supporting Trump might seem appealing to some, but the long-term effects of his policies‚Äîballooning debt, alienating allies, and unstable markets‚Äîcould do more harm than good.

"That doesn't really matter if inflation started going up as soon as Biden got into office. His horrendous, evil energy policy combined with insane government spending and the flooding of the country with illegal immigrants forced the hand of the fed to move the interest rates and created the disaster that we're in now. The president can take actions to control inflation, his actions exacerbated it. And to add insult to injury, he had an ""Inflation Reduction Act"" which contained absolutely no remedy to inflation as some sort of horrific Orwellian nightmare. And you're STILL going to vote for these lunatics.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"The ""steady job growth and recovery"" was at the expense of issuing highly attractive free loans to rich bankers who were the ones who helped crash the economy in the first place. Most of the problems we see now with these predatory companies coming in and swooping up everything with full financial control is a direct result of Obama's policies. 

Tax cuts did not lead to bigger national debt. Prior to world war 2, there was virtually no income tax. What happens is when you tax incomes, be it for the middle or upper class, it causes wealthy people to hire less and middle class and poor people to work less. If the tax cuts are aligning with GDP growth then it is a net benefit for the economy.

The trade war with China did not hurt anyone. People say that but it just didn't happen. Inflation was exactly where it needed to be in an optimal U.S. economy at the time Trump was president. The inflation we see now started with the Biden administration's second year, which was a direct result of excessive government spending and the most atrocious, evil energy policy in United States history. The reason things are even worse are because the Biden administration had no idea how to set controls or limits on anything they were doing, so they forced the hand of federal reserve to hike the interest rates which instantly made everything even more unaffordable and killed much of the hot job market, which we now see in the recent jobs report which shows a net loss of public sector jobs. And all this is before we even get into the disasterous economic results of letting 20 million poor people seeking shelter and resources, some being criminals, into the country.

What you're saying just simply isn't true, but I don't blame you because the media sources you digest probably don't even report on it. The record high inflation and terrible job market are a direct result of Biden's policies and people who vote for Kamala Harris are sadly just going to prolong this misery for four more years.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Honestly, there‚Äôs a lot to unpack here, so let‚Äôs look at a few things.

First, on the ‚Äúfree loans to bankers‚Äù during the Obama years‚Äîyeah, it‚Äôs frustrating. The Fed did support banks, but Obama also led the economy out of the 2008 crash with consistent job growth that benefited a lot of everyday people. Corporate influence is a huge issue, but it‚Äôs been around for decades; he didn‚Äôt create it.

On Trump‚Äôs tax cuts: it‚Äôs a stretch to say they didn‚Äôt add to the debt. Those cuts tacked on over a trillion dollars, mostly benefiting corporations and the wealthy. The promised job boom didn‚Äôt really happen; instead, we saw increased corporate profits without much trickle-down to everyday workers.

The trade war with China? That hit American farmers and manufacturers hard, leading to billions in government bailouts just to keep some businesses afloat. Plus, U.S. businesses relying on imports saw costs rise, which often means higher prices for consumers. Even if inflation was stable then, the ripple effects of those tariffs are part of the supply chain mess we‚Äôre dealing with now.

And on inflation‚Äîit‚Äôs not just a ‚ÄúBiden issue.‚Äù Inflation is up around the world due to supply chain disruptions, energy markets, and global recovery from COVID. Biden‚Äôs energy policies might feel like a tough shift, but they aim to reduce our dependence on oil long-term, which most experts agree is critical.

When it comes to proposals from Harris (and the Biden administration) versus Trump‚Äôs approach, economists generally favor Harris‚Äôs focus on investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and workforce training, seeing them as steps to create sustainable growth. By contrast, experts criticized Trump‚Äôs policies for prioritizing short-term gains, like tax cuts for the wealthy, over long-term economic resilience. Even on trade, many economists saw Trump‚Äôs tariffs as disruptive without a clear benefit for American workers or consumers. 

In short, experts tend to agree that Harris‚Äôs proposals are aimed at building a more stable, resilient economy, while Trump‚Äôs policies often prioritized short-term wins but left some significant vulnerabilities behind. Other than the economy, are there other reasons you support Trump? Thanks for sharing your thoughts in more detail by the way.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

And I‚Äôm guessing that if you or your loved ones somehow found their way back into the fold, you would gladly take up the conservative cause under the Republican banner once again",2024_11_04,06_23_09

I mean yeah they are allowed to but tons of GOP policies are fucking objectively harmful for citizens and the nation or, depending on the issue, even scientifically unfounded. The problem people have is this: being vocally against Trump is a good thing and he's a threat to democracy. HOWEVER, GOP policies pre Trump and clearly after he's gone are ALSO harmful to democracy and society. So yes, taking down the figure head is good but the GOP barely has any policies and they ones they do have are harmful and yet they keep rallying around them.

>What‚Äôs different about Trump is his temperament, willingness to undermine institutions and trajectory towards fascism.

Only in the sense that he's trying to speedrun the process the GOP has been trying to do for decades. They stole a court seat, they gerrymander more commonly and more severely than Democrats, they stand for voter suppression policies and tactics, they don't believe in social equality...

Like look man its awesome some prominent Republicans are speaking out against Trump. We need that. But the GOP doesn't suddenly become a legitimate or serious party when Trump is gone. 

>Cheney has stood up when almost all of her colleagues remained silent; clearly to the detriment of her own career and her personal safety. I respect her enormously for it.

Sure and I mostly agree.... but I'm a somewhat cynical guy and all I can see is ""I can be the face of a pseudo rebranded GOP that does all the same shit but just does it less conspicuously and then I can be president!""

Time will tell. Right now it's good to have her speaking out. As soon as Trump is gone she should be shown the door just like the rest of the GOP who enabled him.

My favorite example of that is John McCain, whose overaggressive pursuit of banking deregulation was directly responsible for the S&L crash of the 1980's and a deep recession that forced George H.W. Bush out of office. Despite that, he continued to stump for deregulation all the way up to 2008, when then-presidential-candidate McCain declared that the economic fundamentals of the heavily-deregulated subprime mortgage industry were ""sound"" immediately before it all crashed and caused a depression.

"A lot to explain to you here. I was clear when I said ""modal"" politician. Respond to that point if you want to, but I won't engage in some contrived situation that is clearly not what I meant.

You are confusing ideology with partisanship, which is an incredibly common mistake that people make. People who always vote for Democrats don't, inherently, mindlessly follow a party for example. It is simply because the Democrats are the closest to their preferred policy positions. Someone can easily be an extreme far leftist and consistently vote Democratic simply because there is no better option. That doesn't mean they are as you describe partisans. 

However, by saying you are a centrist what you are saying is that you don't have policy positions because your ""central"" position is simply a function of the Downsian median voter theory. There is no policy position or ideology about centrists because centrism is inherently, and necessarily, bereft of those. It has to be, by definition.

That is the whole problem with centrists in any political context, their ideological position is simply a function of the electoral system they live in, not one based in theories of democracy, human rights, and economics. Of course some people do just mindlessly vote for parties, but that isn't what we are talking about here.

"You seem rather confused. I am responding to someone who posited a specific definition of centrism, which is a faulty one as it conflates ideology and partisanship. You put forth an even more faulty definition that is fully undermined by the logical failures in it. The issue, beyond your bad definition of the word, is that it is not how centrism is deployed in any scholarly or colloquial context.

But fine, let's take your definition. It is nonsensical. What it comes off as you are trying to say is you are pragmatic. Being a non-centrist doesn't inherently mean you don't know the world is complicated or that you have to live in a society. Moreover, many ""centrist"" policies have serious second-order effects or are downright ineffectual simply because of their needing to fit competing worldviews. Centrist policies aren't ""better"" they are just what can pass in a particular electoral system. A different country would produce a different ""centrist"" policy.

There is no value or superiority to being ""centrist"". People who claim they are centrist don't understand the world better, or know more. Research on political independents in the United States places them as being no better informed than the more extreme political ideologues.

Now if you want to call yourself a pragmatic, fine. That is one way to look at the world, but it is also not a political ideology (which is what kicked off this whole conversation).",2024_11_04,06_23_09

That happened because they were doing a first full test launch of a new heavy lift rocket.

"I suspect Musk tilted just because Trump offered him something that money can't buy so easy... an authoritative position in government that would allow Musk to put a chokehold on his corporate competitors (domestic and foreign) while changing laws and throwing Federal taxpayer money into his own business interests.  And, of course, Musk businesses get waivers from Trump's universal tariffs. 

In return, Musk turned Xitter into a Trump political machine. 

The security clearance is a real and serious concern, but probably not one that was influencing Musks decision making.  Billionaires live their lives with no real belief that consequences exist, and if you look at the world that's generally how things play out. 

But they go apeshit over opportunities to get even more money and power. 

If Harris does win the election, however, Musk is in a world of hurt because he became overtly political, and this is something that people with criminal liability really should not do.  Including, hopefully, some investigation to Musks very high security clearance and very high friendship with Vladimir Putin. 

The US seems to have adopted a very high tolerance for traitors and seditionists, and that should probably change.  Harris, a prosecutor and DA, is just the kind of person to make that change.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Society/the economy are *straining* to feed him and are getting sickened in return.  We need to stop this.

Trump is his ticket to that: Trump will give him direct power and influence, which will lead to more wealth, more praise on X from his fans, etc.  And he has already admitted it will create vast harships and struggles for average Americans to feed Musk's ego and endless hunger.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

">¬†Is that why Elon ran to Trump when Harris put the business pants on immigration?

There is a possibility that Musk really means what he says when he claims Trump is the only president that could get humanity to Mars.

Musk has been experiencing a lot of frustration with the FAA about delayed licenses for his Starship launches because of ‚Ä¶ well, due process. Inhibited by some bad faith actors, it seems, but due process nonetheless.¬†

Musk sees that Trump doesn‚Äôt care about due process whatsoever and may think that if he supports Trump, then Trump will let him launch however much he wants whenever he wants, which he probably thinks will speed up SpaceX‚Äôs road to Mars. Such a view, that the end justifies the means ‚Äì and humanity needs to get to Mars to survive ‚Äì would be consistent with Musk‚Äôs behaviour for the past two decades.¬†

Then again, Musk‚Äôs behaviour lately has been much more erratic than before, so I‚Äôm not even convincing myself here. To be honest, I think Musk has just lost it.¬†

But there may be some remnants of his former thinking about Mars that ultimately drives his now-erratic behaviour. Maybe what I described is what he tells himself.¬†",2024_11_04,06_23_09

A juxtaposition that most Christian conservatives don't care about.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
"This is a short but interesting article about Harris's religious life. She identifies as a Baptist. Her Hindu mother sent Harris and her sister to the Baptist Church so they would grow up to be ""strong Black women"". She is, of course, married to a Jewish man, and her family participates in both Christian and Jewish cultures. She calls her pastor to pray together before major decisions.

I'm an atheist, and I don't really like how much influence religion has on our politics. But Harris strikes me as the kind of Christian who emphasizes unity and kindness. I see her as probably similar to Obama: someone with the ability to draw from multiple faiths to reach across our divides. I can respect Christians like that.

> Kamala Harris told a Michigan church on Sunday that God offers America a &quot;Divine plan strong enough to heal division,&quot; while Donald Trump gave a profane and conspiracy-laden speech in which he mused about reporters being shot and labeled Democrats as &quot;Demonic.""

> Harris finished her remarks in about 11 minutes - starting and ending during Trump&#039;s roughly 90-minute speech at a chilly outdoor rally at the Lancaster, Pennsylvania, airport.

> Trump usually veers from subject to subject, a discursive style he has labeled &quot;The weave.&quot; But in Lancaster, he went on long tangents and hardly mentioned his usual points on the economy, immigration and rote criticisms of Harris.

Also rapist and abuser, and fraudster, and a liar and a cheat. The rapist part seems most significant in light of this story.

Back when I was teaching high school in the 1980s, one of my best students started missing classes. I asker her why and she said she was being abused by her step-dad. I reported this to the school counsellor, who called the police. I checked back with the school counsellor a week or so later, and I was told the police had  investigated, and had not found enough physical evidence to do anything. Meanwhile my student had started sleeping in the park.

If only I'd had half the brains of Kamala Harris! My student's best friend from kindergarten was in the class, and I could have brought them together. If I'd brought them together and we had talked out the situation, she probably would have been able to stay with her friend for the last semester of high school, instead of being a homeless person.

> It's more profitable for them to let some units sit empty than to start undercutting each other. 

No it isn't, that's not how any economics works anywhere, unless it's a monopoly. In which case there's STILL no incentive to leave units empty, since you STILL lose money as a monopolist having to pay upkeep and property tax with no income.

(The prices would all be higher than competitive ones but still low enough to fill the units).

Some units remain empty while just trying to find a good tenant, or if there's a solid reason why the market is known to shift soon like during the summer in a university town waiting for the next semester to start.

"Municipalities should enact a ""Vacancy Tax"", which taxes unoccupied residential dwellings. The proceeds from this tax should go to grants and loans to build low income housing, services like health and housing for homeless, rental assistance for low income, down payment assistance for first time home buyers, etc.

Short term stays like AirBnB do not count as ""Occupied"". ""Occupied"" would need to be defined as being occupied by the owner of the property for at least x months a year or having a renter living in the property as their primary residence.

If you don't wanna pay the ""Vacancy Tax"", sell it, or rent it out. If nobody wants to buy or rent it, lower your ask until it's occupied.

edit: Properties primarily used for AirBnB and other such businesses should be re-classified as some sort of ""Temporary Commercial"" and taxed appropriately. When the property is no longer used for commercial purposes, its classification should be reverted back to residential. Operating an improperly zoned business like this should have steep fines.

>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve demonstrated since 2017 that continually investing in organizing, especially young voters, is so important, and so I‚Äôm using the organization that I‚Äôve built and putting it back to work,‚Äù Ossoff said in an interview with POLITICO, after launching a canvass effort in a strip mall parking lot alongside Warnock, Democratic House candidate Wade Herring and Savannah Mayor Van R. Johnson.

>‚ÄúI have gone up to people to talk about the election and had them look me in the eye and say, ‚ÄòNo, I already voted for these people,‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThen, we have to explain to people, ‚ÄòYeah, we had a primary, then we had a primary runoff and now you‚Äôve got to go again.‚Äô‚Äù

>‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôll probably have to go in December and do it one more time,‚Äù he added.

>A post-election analysis of Ossoff‚Äôs field program, conducted by former campaign aides in the spring of 2021, estimated that Ossoff‚Äôs ‚Äúpaid relational‚Äù organizing program, paired with a traditional volunteer field organization, boosted turnout by 3.8 percent among 160,000 voters targeted. Ossoff and Warnock won their 2021 runoffs by 55,232 votes and 93,550 votes respectively.

>The idea behind paid relational organizing is this: Ossoff campaign hired 2,800 Georgians, particularly those with little or no voting history themselves, to become ‚Äúcommunity mobilizers‚Äù ‚Äî a term Ossoff coined for their role. The campaign suspected that those organizers would be well-positioned to influence irregular voters or nonvoters in their own personal networks to get involved.

>‚ÄúWe have been able to significantly increase turnout and participation by young voters and voters who are typically ignored and written off,‚Äù Ossoff continued.

>Ossoff‚Äôs efforts join a sprawling network of field operations in the state, spearheaded by Warnock and Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor. A number of get-out-the-vote nonprofits are also involved, as Democrats look for a way to close strong after several weeks of public polling gains by GOP Senate candidates, including Walker.

>I‚Äôve noticed one Democratic candidate who defies this trend. While consultants and organizers talk about the need for rural talking points and investments in rural newspaper and radio buys, this politician has deployed the most obvious strategy for making inroads with rural voters: He showed up in every county in his state.

>Then, he did something really remarkable: He showed up again.

>The attention a high-profile candidate like Fetterman has paid to rural areas of his state may begin to ease the rural inferiority complex that‚Äôs been festering for decades, as rural economies have stagnated, small towns have lost population and country folks have become the butt of jokes. One 27-year-old woman in Westmoreland County, part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area that struggles against the ‚ÄúPennsyltucky‚Äù stereotype, praised Fetterman for showing up and speaking bluntly.

She told me this acting proud of the situation. All I heard was:

-she deliberately went looking for a fight (trump shirt in the more liberal area)

-lashed out at the first potential target

-bragged about it to first person she could

-when lightly scolded she mocked the first person‚Äôs disability

Some people may be swept up in it. But a lot of these people were always assholes but had learned to keep their smassholery to themselves.

"It's okay to call Republicans Nazis when they support a man who says he needs his Generals to be more like Hitler's.

It's okay to call Republicans Nazis when they cheer for and support fascist policies. 

If Democrats were calling for the government to take control of all private business you'd be right in calling Democrats communist. If Kamala was going on about America's great leap forward you'd be right calling Kamala supporters communists.

Words have meaning, and if you act and support policies that are fascist and your leader wants America to closer resemble Nazi Germany... Well... What else would you call that person? 

""America is for Americans only"", ""immigrants are tainting the blood of America"", ""the immigrants are eating the dogs and cats""... That's incredibly on the nose and is Trump openly saying ""I'm a fascist.""

If you don't want America supporting our allies, you are a shitty American. 

If you don't like immigration, then don't vote for the man who tables the bipartisan immigration bill.

If you want a job and a strong economy, don't vote for the man promising to destroy it with a trade war and creating 33 Trillion dollars of debt (according to the American Tax Institute).

So if it isn't any of those things because Trump's plans are to actually make them worse... Then I am going to assume it's all the Nazi stuff you really like. Because that's the only thing that makes sense; why else would you want to run America into the ground?

Trump is a rapist. Trump is a criminal. Trump was best friends with Jeffrey Epstein. Trump tried to nuke a hurricane. Trump killed millions of Americans during COVID. Trump started a trade war with China costing us 27 billion dollars during his term alone just in agriculture. Trump ended his term with skyrocketing inflation and debt. Trump ended his term losing jobs. Trump ended his term by trump to subvert democracy and steal the election like a dictator. Trump stole our national security secrets and let our enemies see them.

It's worth noting that the MOE is ~6 percent, so Trump could feasibly have a 3 point lead in Iowa. But even if Harris doesn't win there, the relative closeness implies Trump is considerably weaker in the rest of the Midwest than most of the other pollsters seem to be saying.

"The key is supposed to be to look at a large number of polls and look for trends.  The margin of error is there because of math, and is basically impossible to get rid of.

Imagine an election between heads and tails that is as much of a 50-50 race as you can get. If you poll 200 people, you are mathematically very unlikely to get 100-100.  Numbers in the 90-110 range are what you would expect.  So you would report heads +5, but that would be within your 7 or so point margin of error.  (you can do this yourself if you want, either by flipping coins or making a quick excel program).  

What happens with pollsters is that they expect a 50-50 race, and they know if they say heads+5 they will be laughed at, so they weigh different numbers. For example they may say that every fourth flip is more representative, so instead of getting a value of .25, they will give it a value of .28.  And this makes the poll now say heads+1, and more in line.

As for Nate Silver, I think it's a bit more complicated. He has a vested interest in the polling industry being right, but at the same time if it *is* way off, he has a vested interest in being the first person to point that out, because he can then go down as the expert who saw the polls would be off when nobody else did. This is pretty much what happened in 2012, when he said Obama was the clear favorite even when everyone else said the election was a tie, and being right on that gave a huge boost to his career.

One Iowa detail to bear in mind is that they did ban abortions after 6 weeks. That‚Äôs one reason that Iowa might be particularly high for women turning out for Harris, although it‚Äôs not the only state that‚Äôs done this, its more than a dozen now.

It‚Äôs a bit off for NYTimes to do that as much as they are, but it‚Äôs better than everyone clustering around the wrong assumptions, which is what almost all the polls seem to be doing currently.

"Are you seriously unaware of Biden's entire record of 50+ years in politics?!

As President, he's moved a bit to the left (in American terms), thanks to Obama, but there's a mountain of reasons he was in last place in the 2016 Democratic primary before the 1% put their thumbs on the scales before Super Tuesday. 

For all of his years of public service, whenever the GOP held firm on an evil position, it was Joe leading the way in making the Democrats compromise.

But you can't ""compromise"" with evil. And some issues are black and white. And by compromising again and again with the GOP, we've now reached a place when there are now *establishment Republicans* supporting Harris for president, FFS. That's how indistinguishable the Democratic party has become from what the Republican party *used to be* (not MAGA, of course).

Now, don't get me wrong, Harris is better than Trump as president. There can be no question of that. No sane rational argument in Trump's favor can be made.

But the same billionaires who took Biden from last place to the presidency in less than a week also chose Harris within 24 hours of Biden stepping down. No primaries, no debates, no brokered convention. We got no choice in picking from a field of Democratic hopefuls...ALL of them more popular than Harris (who had dropped out in 2016 before last place Joe).

Unfortunately, though I like the guy and he's made some amends here as VP under Obama and as President for the past four years, Joe's been a huge part of that corruption of Democratic ideals for the overwhelming majority of this public service. 

And, as the 1% took control of both political parties in the USA over the past 50 years, Joe was there, compromising with evil, every step of the way.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"I get why Obama tried for bipartisanship. We are a democracy, and democracy requires compromise. The mistake he made was not having a Plan B for when the GOP stabbed him in the back. For instance, when it became clear that the American Restoration and Recovery Act was going to get almost no GOP votes after weeks of negotiations, the Democrats should have torpedoed their own bill and passed a more liberal one. In terms of the ACA, Democrats should have lowered the filibuster threshold to keep the public option; if the public option that covers everyone and everything passes, no one‚Äôs health care is disrupted, and people caught in the recession would feel that much less pressure to find a job, since they would have known that their health and that of their family would have been okay. It would have opened up a can of worms, but the filibuster is why people think government doesn‚Äôt work and that nothing changes; it would also encourage voters to turn out to protect us from going backwards. 

The Biden administration seemed to have learned from those mistakes. They tried negotiation for the American Rescue Plan, but when it became clear that was going to come up short, they passed a better bill. I was fine with Biden negotiating infrastructure on a bipartisan basis, as he‚Äôd promised to do so with there still being independents out there who, for reasons passing understanding, value bipartisanship over the quality of a bill. Then the Democrats didn‚Äôt even bother reaching out to Republicans to pass the Inflation Reduction Act. It would have been larger had Manchin not insisted that it would be fully paid for, which is fine; Kyrsten Sinema‚Äôs insistence on not taxing the rich basically killed the chance of it being a bigger bill. She even killed a provision to further tax hedge funds.

> Statewide, voters virtually tie in preference for a Democrat or a Republican for the U.S. House of Representatives, 45% to 44%. By a 16-point margin, likely Iowa voters prefer a Democrat over a Republican in the 1st District, where Democrat Christina Bohannan and Republican U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks are competing.

> The poll shows Democrats with an advantage in the 1st and 3rd congressional districts, which have been highly competitive this year, while voters prefer Republican candidates in the 2nd and 4th districts.

> The poll shows a slight plurality of likely voters statewide prefer a Democrat over a Republican for the U.S. House of Representatives, 45% to 44%.

My personal prediction as a 32 year life long Iowan resident is that trump will win by 2-3% this year and Kamala will likely win the election as a whole by a moderate landslide. 

After, I think you‚Äôre going to be hearing a lot about Iowa having the best chance for flipping a senate seat and governors house in the nation and we will be in the news quite a bit leading up to 26. People are so fucking sick of how much republicans have fucked our state since 2010.

"That's not a fraudulent act in her mother's name.  It might be considered fraud in her own name, but I personally don't think that's likely to be charged.  I think they will mostly try to avoid creating any type of precedent that might punish a witness for providing their own signature along with avoiding potentially muddying the case to the jury.

If they didn't have other charges, maybe, but since it's voting-related, there's a pretty big First Amendment area that's protected when providing your own... I'm not quite sure what it would be called off the top of my head.  Similar to testimony, but not related to a trial.  Your own personal opinion?  Official support of something?  We'll at least say an official statement related to voting in some manner.

Anyway, you have the right to be truthfully and honestly wrong in many cases.  There's a possibility that precedent already exists for somewhat similar situations and might make it more complicated for a jury to cleanly convict on the unquestionably fraudulent acts.

Edit: Or, if I were to empathize, her mom did recently die, so she's probably grieving and not making entirely rational decisions.  Signing her name as a witness on her mom's ballot might be part of her grieving process and isn't, by itself, wrong.  She crossed the line by forging her mom's signature (repeatedly) and submitting her ballot.

So why can't other democrats? If your leader can do it, so can you? Look what happens to Hilary ""the deplorables"" incident lost her the election. And online aggression does count. It is the driving force of extremist republicanism. 
Don't dismiss the power of the internet. I'm old enough to remember a time when the internet didn't really exist and neither did extremist groups because they had no loud voice. Now they have a voice and they easily manipulate people.

*****
> At the tail end of an arduous, hotly contested presidential election campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris managed to have the last laugh.

> The sketch, which focused on dueling rallies by Harris and former President Trump, offered a comic compendium of recent events from the trail, with references to Trump&#039;s appearance driving a garbage truck and President Biden&#039;s tendency to go off script in front of reporters.

> With her surprise visit Saturday to New York&#039;s 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Harris joined a roster of White House hopefuls who have appeared on the long-running sketch show, including her Republican opponent Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.

Hell, even the fun cameos that past Dems have made in TV shows. Michelle Obama‚Äôs appearance on iCarly, or Biden in the two episodes of Parks and Rec that he was in. Can you picture any prominent Republicans doing something like that? Although in fairness, I guess Newt Gingrich was in an episode of Parks and Rec too.

Adding to your point, most undecided voters are essentially ‚Äúlurkers‚Äù when it comes to politics. 

They don‚Äôt have enough bandwidth or care to do any meaningful research, but they still want to participate. As a result, they rely on co-workers, family members, celebrity endorsements, podcasts, social accounts, viral clips, memes, etc. to feed them the info.

"Honestly, as a man who is very liberal and considers himself a kind person, I hope more women can realize the power they have over men. Ultimatums and strong, unwavering stances that contradict the conservative outlook are often best served by the person who is most intimate with them. My partner lets me have it all the time and I feel the same way she does about everything. Men need reminders. We are pretty dumb.

I strongly feel that if a woman is with a man who plans to vote against her wellbeing, happiness, and autonomy the response should absolutely be proportional. I will never understand how men can look at what the right is planning and not realize how little desire women are going to have to be with them. 

Frankly speaking, and specifically in the realm hetero-centric thought processes, a man has a few primary motivators in life. Career, hobbies, and sex.   Sex is hands down the most potent for obvious reasons (sex rules). This simple fact has been so under-discussed and it makes me crazy. 

The answer to me is plain: If his vote turns you off, don‚Äôt be giving him any. Most importantly, tell him why and then tell him how he can turn the faucet back on. 

Spell it out and be strong. Men are weaker than you think. We (proverbial we) don‚Äôt tend to actually believe in the things we feel ‚Äústrongly‚Äù about. Men typically bitch about things like iMmIGratiOn, tAXeS, and tHe DeMs because we (proverbial we) don‚Äôt actually have any real, substantive problems. GIVE THEM A DIRECT PROBLEM and watch the fake ones melt before your very eyes. 

A Tactical suggestion for a woman who is with a man who they suspect is planning on voting for trump (an existing intimate relationship an obvious prerequisite): 

Bring up their favorite sexual act out of the blue. Really peak their excitement. Ask them if they would like to do said sexual activity. When they reply with an obligatory ‚ÄúYES‚Äù, say ‚ÄúCool. That‚Äôs great. If you would ever like to do that activity again, you won‚Äôt vote against my rights on Tuesday. I will know if you‚Äôre lying. The choice is yours to make, big guy.‚Äù

"I was definitely in the camp of being cautiously optimistic for a Kamala win, but this poll kind of pushes me to the point of being actually confident. This seriously appears to be the only pollster who knows what the hell they‚Äôre doing. I think this poll‚Äôs biggest miss was Iowa‚Äôs last gubernatorial race, where it predicted a 2 point win by the Democrat, but the Republican won by 2 or 3. So even if it‚Äôs off by this poll‚Äôs largest error to date, you‚Äôre still looking at a one or two point win by Trump - which is pretty much a 8 or 9 point swing from the last two presidential elections. Wisconsin and Iowa are very similar demographically, and I think if there‚Äôs that big a swing in Iowa towards the Democratic candidate, that will probably translate to Wisconsin as well. And since Biden won WI by 20k votes in 2020, a swing like that would basically mean Wisconsin goes to Kamala by a pretty huge margin. At that point, you have to wonder how many more states will experience a similar swing in voting towards Harris?

"Highlights from the Madison Square Garden rally include:

A disparaging joke about welcoming Latinos into the U.S. ‚Äúwith open arms‚Äù while making a shooing motion.

Disparaged Latinos with a crass joke about making babies and illegal immigration

Quipped that Puerto Rico is ‚Äúa floating island of garbage

Said that Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce ‚Äúmight be the next O.J. Simpson,‚Äù referring to the football star who was accused and later acquitted of murdering his ex-wife. Kelce is in a relationship with pop singer Taylor Swift, who earlier this year said she would vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.

‚ÄúThe whole party ‚Äî a bunch of degenerates,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúJew-haters and lowlifes, every one of them.‚Äù (talking about Democratic party)

Giuliani, a former personal lawyer to Trump, falsely claimed that Harris was ""on the side of the terrorists"" in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Multiple speakers also insulted Harris, with private equity fund manager Grant Cardone calling her a ""fake."" ""Her and her pimp handlers will destroy our country,"" he said.

Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson later made fun of Harris‚Äô mixed-race heritage. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be pretty hard [for Democrats] to look at us and say, ‚ÄòYou know what? Kamala Harris, she got 85 million votes because she‚Äôs just so impressive. As the first Samoan-Malaysian low-IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president. It was just a groundswell of popular support.‚Äô‚Äù

Carlson then went beyond insults, nodding to the racist ‚Äúgreat replacement theory‚Äù he has espoused in the past.

That sentiment was echoed later, when former Trump White House aide Stephen Miller told the crowd: ‚ÄúAmerica is for Americans and Americans only.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnce I take office, the migrant invasion of our country ends and the restoration of our country begins,‚Äù trump told the crowd.

Trump also took the time to address a recent interview with Fox News, in which he had characterized ‚Äúradical left lunatics‚Äù as ‚Äúthe enemy from within‚Äù and proposed using the military against them. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre smart and they‚Äôre vicious, and we have to defeat them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd when I say, ‚Äòthe enemy from within,‚Äô the other side goes crazy. Becomes a sound ‚Äì ‚Äòoh, how can he say‚Äô ‚Äì no, they‚Äôve done very bad things to this country. They are indeed the enemy from within.‚Äù

Trump spoke repeatedly about his plans to halt illegal immigration and deport migrants he described as ""vicious and bloodthirsty criminals"" if he wins the Nov. 5 election.

""On day one I will launch the largest deportation program in American history,"" he said. ""I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered.""

Trump called Harris a ""very low IQ individual""

He vowed to ban sanctuary cities

"[Biden had 78% of the Latino vote in PA in 2020](https://www.as-coa.org/articles/chart-how-us-latinos-voted-2020-presidential-election).

"I ran the numbers for how Independents leaned in 2020 against the current early voting numbers, and here‚Äôs what they came out with:

Arizona: With Republicans increasing their early voting share by 8 percentage points compared to 2020, this state might lean slightly towards Trump if 2020 independent trends hold.

Georgia: Independent voters leaned towards Biden in 2020. While early voting data does not show a significant party advantage here, if 2020 independent preferences hold, this could favor Harris.

Michigan: With early voting showing no significant shift in party advantage, if independents mirror 2020‚Äôs lean toward Biden, this could indicate an advantage for Harris.

Nevada: Republicans have boosted their early voting share by 4 points over 2020, suggesting a slight advantage for Trump if independents align similarly to 2020.

North Carolina: Independent voters were nearly split in 2020 with a slight lean towards Trump. With early voting still competitive, this could again lean towards Trump.

Pennsylvania: Democrats currently have an early voting lead, although Republicans have reduced the gap by 22 points compared to 2020. If independents trend like 2020, Harris might maintain an edge here.

Wisconsin: If early voting trends and 2020 independent preferences hold, Harris could retain an advantage here, as independents leaned towards Biden in 2020.

In summary, based solely on early voting patterns and assuming 2020 independent preferences are consistent:

Potential Trump Advantage: Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina

Potential Harris Advantage: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin

Trump: 239",2024_11_04,06_23_09

In 2016, the college educated crowd was much more split than it is today, for example, and the working class vote was also a bit more evenly shared.

Democrats' ability to outperform in 2018 and 2022 also point in favor of the hypothesis, since midterms tend to favor the party that best appeals to low-propensity voters.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

If Kamala wins at 270, that'll be a clear signal that he still has winning potential. In the scenerio I expect he'll announce his campaign sometime within a month after the election, with rally's by the end of the year.

But if Trump loses by a rate higher than 2020 or near that level, we might see some mutinies. The most obvious IMO will be JD Vance, who will think he has a chance to carry the torch.  There will also be a few Trump offsprings and cousins that will run.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Its a matter of perspective, though. He did best from a polling point of view, but he ultimately lost. When the turnout was low, he won. I think we might surpass 2020 totals when you look at early voting counts. That could just be people who normally vote on election day coming out early, which I'm sure to some degree it is, but we won't know that until after the election. I'm honestly pretty optimistic.

"Yeah, I really don't know what to think.  I live in ""deep red"" WV, and when I moved here I didn't think the redness was really that sincere.  Now that I've been here a while, the culture is different from my first impressions, but along the same themes I expected.  Issue by issue, people aren't all that conservative in general.  They want better worker protections, to be able to unionize, etc.  When I talk to my neighbors about specific issues, they often articulate complaints and positions that are extremely consistent with DNC talking points.  Yet, if I go as far as asking about particular candidates, all logic and issue positions gets quickly tossed, and they are emotionally wedded to the GOP and Trump.  I still struggle to really understand why, and I'm leaning toward just a lot of propaganda.  The TV commercials here are all about Democrats and government getting in the way and causing problems, but there's never any actual argument, it's just ""the democrats caused your problems, vote Republican to fix them.""  There is no acknowledgment at all that the only Democrats that have been significant in this state in the 21st century are Jim Justice and Joe Manchin, both now Republicans.  There is no acknowledgement that the GOP has been in control literally the whole time that things have been getting worse here.  Basically everyone around here agrees that the sexuality and gender stuff the state house is obsessed with is not something they agree with or want.  

However, there is a huge component of evangelical Christianity.  It's not quite an outright majority but it is huge here, and of course evangelical Christians for some reason completely unrelated to the Bible itself are absurdly passionate in their opposition to abortion, not that we have had any in this state for years anyway.  It's very puzzling to me.  

Anyway, early voting figures are showing that registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats by a fairly significant amount in early voting, but boy have we been showing up to vote.  The community facebook pages have daily questions about where and how to vote.  There was a significant line when I arrived to vote, and a lot more people arriving as I left.  There are a couple of Harris signs on the main road, although they are vastly outnumbered by Trump signs; in fact the total number of Harris lawn signs doesn't come close to the number giant Trump billboards and flags on display in yards in various kinds of neighborhoods including large well kept farms, trailer parks, and our handful of suburban developments.  

Meanwhile, there is some quiet opposition to a state program put in place to attract out of state remote workers like myself, but the program keeps paying people to move here from blue states... and we are bringing our values with us.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"It's actually likely to be a landslide, despite how close the polling has been. In part \*because\* of how close the polling has been. All the swing states are within the margin of error, so if there's any polling error one way or the other, then all the swing states could lean the same way and deliver a landslide.

For instance, if there's a large number of ""hidden Harris voters"" and most polls are underestimating her, then a few extra points across the board could see Harris sweep the swing states and blow it out. This Selzer poll opens the question of whether such an error might be big enough to see a few red states flip as well.

On the other hand, if the polls are underestimating Trump, then we could see him sweep the swing states and win in a landslide.

It's possible that the swing states will split and deliver a very close contest, but that would require the polling to have been very accurate, which is actually less likely.

By current standards it's no longer 375. Closest to that definition is Obama in 2008. Winning 365 electoral votes. Nobody in today standards will reach that level any time soon.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
"I was planning to travel to the nearest swing state to help out on election day, but this year no concrete plan has materialized, and the official campaign doesn't seem to be even accepting any volunteers for election day itself.

"There are still places in rural America where there is no cell service or internet. I have friends who bought a house in upstate NY and they have no useable cell service and just got very slow internet in the past couple of years. Their entertainment is renting movies from the gas station that also serves as their grocery store. 

There‚Äôs about 500,000 square miles in America with no cell coverage. That‚Äôs about 14% and highly concentrated in rural states. If you live in a lot of the Midwest, you have to have a landline to communicate. Even in places that technically have coverage, it can be very spotty.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Our landline had never gone out in 27 years and has a lovely call-blocker feature that requires a caller to press #, so we get no junk phone calls at all. Our lines are buried...don't know how they connect beyond our road and really don't care. We are in a rural area, so cell service is sparse or just plain unreliable.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Old-school landlines are powered at the source, so if you have a connection you have the ability to make a call. Electricity is a separate grid.¬†


If you have a modern 3 in 1 fiber connection with a voice over IP phone line, then the telecom company probably installed a battery pack for the fiber line connection. Last mile (meaning the connection from the last terminal to the house eof the user) fiber does not have power. (and really only transoceanic fiber has Power lines to power repeaters along the line). The battery is a UPS that provides 24 hours or so of connectivity should the power go out. With many natural disasters power cna be out for a week or more.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Flood insurance is becoming mandatory everywhere over the next three years, flood zone or not. Chances of a claim to being paid right now is 30%, 70% are currently being denied. Chances that your claim will be altered and lowered by 70% is near 100%. These ‚Äúpop up back room insurance companies‚Äù the state brought in are under capitalized, just deny claims or pay well short of what they should and when they have had enough they just declare bankruptcy and leave it to state owned Citizens to pick up the pieces. As a homeowner there the state can, and do, assess every single homeowner a ‚Äúfee‚Äù in addition to their own insurance premiums to cover Citizens if it falls short of cash.

"Maybe once upon a time but not anymore, carriers don‚Äôt care to maintain that infrastructure any longer and it‚Äôs been that way for years. A lot of landlines now run over fiber or coax and split at the modem. I remember back in 2016 having to deal with POTS lines for out of band networks and emergency lines constantly getting knocked out to where we had to constantly validate them.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Wow, that's crazy. It sounds super grim when you describe it like that. Is it causing people to leave the state or think about leaving? I know Florida has been one of the fastest growing states the last few years, but I would have to assume the situation you described would put a damper on that",2024_11_04,06_23_09
Why even pay the insurance company if you only have a 30 % chance of getting them to honor their contract,2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Its more about emergency service - police, fire etc.   Buildings are hardlined, so you can get a call into a service or hospital.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"It caused me to leave the state. Lot of people would like to leave but can‚Äôt for financial reasons, condo owners especially. With recent changes to their properties regulations for upkeep and repairs their HOA fees are astronomical rendering their homes un-sellable. Nobody is going to pay 500K for a condo and assume a 50k a year maintenance fee. It really IS grim and that reality is coming due sooner rather than later.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Lot of people don‚Äôt and are going without insurance. Mostly older people who have paid their homes off. Unfortunately those who have mortgages don‚Äôt have a choice pay or foreclosure.

> In a statement, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung defended the former president&#039;s Sunday comments, saying, &quot;President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the Media constantly talks and jokes about.""

Its an issue. I do kinda believe there should be vetted institutions that can present unbiased 'just the facts, ma'am' reporting and follow up reporting but the truth is they have become outmoded and lost the trust of the populace anyway.

So *finding* clear, unbiased, accurate reporting takes work. More work than just turning on Channel 2 used to be.

And as much as I like Brian Tyler Cohen and his reporting, or Leigh McGown (Polititcs Girl) I dunno that they offer that. I *do* like him calling out MAGA - its a fun listen and I  agree but theres hundreds and hundreds  of these personalities reporting.

From Wikipedia:  ‚ÄúWarren was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City on June 22, 1949.[14][15][16][17] She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (n√©e Reed, 1912‚Äì1995), a homemaker,[18] and Donald Jones Herring (1911‚Äì1997), a U.S. Army flight instructor during World War II, both of whom were members of the evangelical branch of the Protestant Methodist Church.‚Äù

"You‚Äôre stretching and making things up to fit a narrative, not a good argument.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"I'm confident that the US will never payout reparations for slavery. The argument won't go much farther than this.

Short Intro of the History: After the Civil War, freed slaves were supposed to get land and livestock. This land proposed was coastal swamp lands. President Andrew Johnson rescinded the offer to appeal to the Southern leaders. Thus freed slaves had little choice but to migrate or share crop under hostile conditions with little pay. Entering the era of Jim Crow, African Americans had little to no civil rights, despite being able to serve in both world wars. I think you know the rest.

It's not about who should or shouldn't feel guilty, it's about acknowledging the economic advancement of the nation through means of the business of slavery. White privilege exists across a spectrum for both domestic and foreign peoples. Black people couldn't advance (post slavery) in a nation not of their own choosing due to racism and discrimination based in policies and culture.

I feel you when you mention the frustration of paying for something you or your ancestors had no control of because that's the plight of african americans and our ancestry. Here's some perspective/questions:

1. Can we say that America would be what it is today without slavery? Would immigrants still have migrated here in the same numbers? 

2. Black people are still very much a minority, so paying into reparations wouldn't be the end of the world. Let's say money goes to families at a certain income level. Same social programs are ran today for the taxes you pay.

3. Last but not least, when do we start talking about the indigenous native americans and how they deserve more attention and resources?",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Taxes aren't a punishment. When used properly, it's meant to pay into welfare, infrastructure, education and anything beneficial to society as a whole that we pay for collectively. Not everything taxes pay for, you will benefit from directly. 

Once again, the problem did not end at emancipation. Many people still preyed on and profited off of the position that black (and brown/non white ethnicities) to get ahead. Even if unintentional and unaware. Everybody did not get to eat at the same table, and instead of sharing - people say ""no, that's mine!"" when they only got a seat because then people on the ground weren't afforded one. 


You don't care about justice, or maybe you are misinformed about where all your taxes go and how complex this issue goes in the United States.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Or maybe if you need a control to this anecdotal data to try to turn it into proper longitudinal data, it would be other wealthy people who aren‚Äôt elected officials, or other elected officials whose ancestors did not own slaves but were present here, or wealthy politicians whose families lost it all and then gained their fortune back in a different community, or politicians who came from an impoverished generation and/or without genealogical knowledge and then who made individual fortunes in their lifetimes and then got elected‚Ä¶I suppose I could blather on, but referencing yourself, someone without major wealth or an elected position is not relevant.

[Un Chien Andalou (1929) by Luis Bu√±uel and Salvador Dal√≠](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inTUNOB7qv4)

A man sharpens a razor and tests it on his thumb. He gazes at the moon, which is about to be bisected by a thin cloud. A young woman stares straight ahead as he brings the razor near her eye. A cut occurs to the cloud passing in front of the moon, and then to a close-up of the razor slicing open a calf's eye.

"Article:

Donald J. Trump, who sought to overturn his loss of the 2020 election, also joked that he didn‚Äôt mind if reporters were shot.

Former President Donald J. Trump told supporters on Sunday that he ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt have left‚Äù the White House at the end of his term during an end-of-campaign rally where he vented angrily about a spate of new public polls showing him losing ground to Vice President Kamala Harris and joked about reporters being shot at.

The former president also described Democrats as a ‚Äúdemonic‚Äù party at the rally, at an airport in Lititz, Pa., his first of three swing-state stops planned for his second to last day on the campaign trail. Mr. Trump‚Äôs voice was audibly hoarse and his speech sluggish as he made unfounded claims about election interference. He praised himself for ditching his prepared remarks, saying it meant the ‚Äútruth‚Äù could come out.

‚ÄúWe had the best border, the safest border,‚Äù Mr. Trump said of his time in the White House. He said that the economy had been in good shape, before mentioning the chart he had been pointing to featuring immigration statistics when he was shot at during a rally in Butler, Pa., in July.

‚ÄúIt said we had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have left, I mean, honestly,‚Äù Mr. Trump continued. He added, ‚ÄúWe did so well, we had such a great‚Äî‚Äù and then cut himself off. He then immediately noted ‚Äúso now, every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there.‚Äù

The remark echoed what Mr. Trump told some aides within days of his 2020 election loss: that he wasn‚Äôt going to leave the White House.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not going to leave,‚Äù Mr. Trump told one aide. He told another, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre never leaving,‚Äù and added: ‚ÄúHow can you leave when you won an election?‚Äù

Mr. Trump never conceded the race to Mr. Biden. And his denials that he had lost that election were issued by himself and a ring of mostly outside advisers and lawyers, who pushed every avenue possible to overturn President Biden‚Äôs victory. Those efforts culminated in an attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6, 2021, as Mr. Biden‚Äôs electoral college victory was being certified.

Hundreds of people have been charged in connection with that attack. Mr. Trump has been indicted in Georgia and by a federal special counsel in connection with his efforts to stay in power.

Mr. Trump also complained about a series of recent polls. His campaign had sent out a memo suggesting a Des Moines Register poll of Iowa showing Mr. Trump losing the state by four points and a new batch of New York Times/Siena College polls of battleground states were incorrect.

Mr. Trump, however, took the complaints to a different level. He spent nearly 20 minutes trying to instill doubts about the election, reviving a host of baseless claims of widespread fraud that he made in 2020.

He claimed that voter machines would be hacked, that elections needed to be called by 11 p.m. on Tuesday night and that efforts to extend polling hours to allow more people to vote ‚Äî something his own party has pushed for in Pennsylvania ‚Äî were tantamount to fraud.

Mr. Trump, while riffing, also pointed to the protective glass encasing him now at outdoor rallies since he survived the assassination attempt in Butler. ‚ÄúTo get to me, somebody would have to shoot through fake news, and I don‚Äôt mind that much, ‚Äôcause, I don‚Äôt mind. I don‚Äôt mind,‚Äù he said, as some in the crowd laughed and howled.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"I watched part of his NC rally. It's real bad. Starting to seem like the crowds are not just thinning but possibly fake. You know how laughs or cheers can just seem scripted? It's that vibe.

He's complaining about being there and being weirdly desperate, pleading and pushing for votes: 

> Look if I don't win this thing after all this talk I'm in trouble. Would you please go and vote? I mean I came here, whatever the hell time it is who the hell knows. I'm giving you the full bore. You wouldn't let me leave in half an hour. I could have run up here done it... start screaming make America great again for five or six times and then leave to the cheers of the crowd, I would have been home sleeping right now. I hope to hell that you're going to get your asses out and vote. Did you all vote?
