"4-0 for Harris here.  My 92 yo FIL is sitting out this one....he voted Occupant 45 first cycle, but someone who was 12 years old, in Berlin, right after WW2, he has recognized  history repeating.....we are in NY so it's OK.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"My sister and I are both Gen X. Opposite sides. We both early voted. She wouldn’t stop going on and on about how Harris is wrong, Trump was right, etc. I told her that we’re not gonna talk politics. She kept going. I told her “well, your vote didn’t  count. I specifically cancelled out your Trump vote”. We have not talked in a week….",2024_11_04,06_23_09
Both of my Gen Z kids (20 & 22) voted.  They did not cancel out my or my wife’s votes.  +4 for Kamala.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
Gen X here. Fortunately my Gen Z kid and I both voted for Harris. No need to cancel my vote,2024_11_04,06_23_09
"From one Gen Z person to another, listen up: 

Your vote matters. Why? Because politicians are more inclined to listen to those who vote than those who don’t. Who you vote for is private, but whether or not you vote is public. If we sit out this election, then our government will not listen to us. So, that’s why we need to step up and vote today, tomorrow, and Election Day. 

And to those who don’t want to vote for Harris and Walz because of Israel and Gaza, I know that what Israel, more specifically Netanyahu, is doing to the Palestinians is horrible and I hate how our government has not done enough to call out Netanyahu for his actions. But let’s be real, Trump is going to give Bibi *everything* he wants on a silver platter, including wiping out the Palestinian people. Do you honestly believe that letting Trump win the election is worth the cost of our country and the lives of the Palestinian people?

[Here’s a link to Bernie Sanders’ take on the matter. I think that it’s important that you and I watch this in case we still have doubts.](https://youtu.be/Vf5MThSniiY)

On top of that, there are other issues on the ballot that are more important than anything in Gaza. Electoral reform, education, economics, healthcare, abortion, LGBTQ, climate change, etc. Those are the things that we need to focus on when we are voting on Tuesday. If Trump and Vance are elected, things will take a turn for the worse, and we and Gen Alpha will have to live with the consequences. 

So please, let’s stop wasting time and get out the vote!",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"The first time I voted  was in 2004. I went with my mom & dad. Mom asked who I picked on the way home. I said Kerry. She hit my dad’s arm and said “told ya so!

The first election that I could vote in was 2012. Despite it being uncommon for people my age to vote, I did so.

But then when the 2014 midterms came about... I figured... it's not a presidential election, what's the point? So I did not vote in that one.

But I was wrong and voting is important. To this day, that is the ONLY election that I was able to vote in and didn't. And I deeply regret it, even now, a decade later.

Don't make the same mistake I did.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

It feels so good to break the cycle and to cancel out their votes. I just want to leave this world better than I found it and be happy…. I’ve been so anxious and scared lately, though I’m starting to feel a little bit of hope.

Reminder that Donald Trump was found to be a sexual abuser by a jury of his peers in May 2023.

But now this melding of evangelical doomsday craziness and GOP fascism is here again - on steroids after Reagan and Lee Atwater’s destruction of the middle class. 

My WW2 US Army Dad is still alive at 100. Nine years ago he said “I fought against corrupt Mussolini fascism and this is it again but under the name of Trump.”  My Mom (deceased at 95) was so upset in 2015 at the rise of Trump she could not stop cautioning us kids.

"> Your vote matters. why? Because politicians are more inclined to listen to those who vote than those who don’t. Who you vote for is private, but whether or not you vote is public. If we sit out this election, then our government will not listen to us.

I have been telling my students this for decades: I don’t care who you vote for, just get out and vote. There’s a reason that politicians care so much about seniors and so little about young people—because seniors vote, and young people don’t. And the only thing that will change that is young people voting.

And this is why it absolutely infuriates me when I see trolls on this sub cynically saying that politicians need to “earn” their vote before they bother to show up.

"I don't understand this either. I heard so many sad, and painful stories of my family's time in Cuba. How can they not see the blatant red flags that they taught me?

My mom was always republican, and even since I was a child, I was always liberal leaning.

I remember taking a political party quiz in school and how my mom paraded it around to my family. All of them laughing and bringing up communism.

I remember the Bush/Gore election and following it closely. My parents tuned in watching everything about it.

My classmates followed closely too. We were deep into climate change and we were so hard core Gore fans.

I remember the disappointment in my mom when she told me she voted Bush. She was proud and smug about it too.

It was years later when Obama was on the ticket and  things changed for my mom.

She said that she was tired of the republican party. She was disappointed in Bush and she really didn't like Romney.

That year, she voted for Obama. When his re-election came, I voted with her and Obama stayed in office.

Through all of it, my mom begged me not to tell our family of her betrayal. 

My mom sadly passed away a few years ago. However, I'm always proud of her for finally seeing things as they were and going against all odds. I'm sad she had to go during Trump's term. I'm glad she went before the insurrection, though. She never liked Trump. I was happy to vote Biden in, and I know she smiled down at me as I voted Harris this time.

Before anybody says it, yes, more people than just that group fled from Cuba, especially in the years after the initial rise. But regardless, many of the Cubans who fled to the US carried inherently conservative views with them as a result. They mainly voted for the Democrats because they were more in line with their interests as immigrants, but over the years this has started to shift, as it has for other Latino groups. In particular with Cubans, they've started to feel that various social programs are precursors or a run-up to another communist regime, thanks to plenty of mud-slinging today.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"There is a lawsuit in Pennsylvania regarding voters who failed to sign the correct date (or did not put any date) on the envelope which contains their mail ballot. 

Argument: the ballot cannot be received before the election authority prints it; the ballot will not be accepted after Election Day. Therefore, the written date is irrelevant. 

Counter-argument: the writing of the date is a critical element of voter intent and any deviation of one of the many required elements (inner envelope, outer envelope, voter written address, voter written date, voter signature, voter signature matches the voter signature on file as judged by a volunteer election official who may belong to a political party who knows the voter’s party affiliation, the envelopes are all correctly sealed, the ballots are marked with the correct ink color, the ballots are turned in with the proper time period. 

A second lawsuit regards the ‘correction’ if any error above. The federal Help America Vote Act allows voters to ‘cure’ any ballot defect by replacing it with a corrected one. This is because ballots are not counted until Election Day, and voters should be able to replace their older ballot with a ‘provisional ballot’. Provisional ballots are reserved and the election authority decides whether they can be counted or not. 

Republicans sued, arguing that any error cannot be fixed as the vote has already been cast - just not yet counted.

A third issue is there have been criminal cases of voters unsure about whether they can cast a vote, and casting a ‘provisional ballot’. In these cases, instead of the election authority deciding whether the ballot can be counted or not, the district attorney of that jurisdiction held the voter responsible for knowing whether their ballot would be counted or not. These voters went to jail.

"The water bit is ridiculous, but the history behind the concept is pretty interesting and goes back to our earliest elections. When the country was first founded, it was common practice to provide alcohol as an incentive to get people to vote. George Washington actually lost an election because he didn’t offer any, so the next round he made up for it. 

Over time, providing an inconsistent reward for voting was viewed as a form of buying votes (to be fair, that was very much the point) so it was banned. 

In an ideal world, there shouldn’t be lines so long that forms of sustenance are required, but it should also be mandatory that polling places have water available for anyone in line. Someone in my neighborhood posted a photo of an early voting line that wrapped around the building, and there have been years where the line actually causes a backup onto the highway.

"Love it. Locked Harris +160. What a joke the political betting market is. Only money moves the line. Couple million get placed on Trump, now the books have to get money to come in on the Harris side so they can make money without actually being on one side or the other. Trump becomes the big favorite-250 and Harris now is the dog, that pays + money depending on when you jump on it. It’s down to +105 since money is now pouring in on Harris. I saw it as high as +185. I got +160. Biggest bet of my life. Only $500. Pays $800.

"Read my lips: repealing Roe v. Wade is going to be their undoing.

It's not rocket science. For the past, I don't know, 10 years or so, we've been running somewhere around 48-52 and the only real shift was which party held the majority. The states that were gerrymandered had supermajorities, but at the Federal level things were close.

Repealing Roe is (I believe) going to push about 5%, maybe as high as 10%, towards the Democrats. My evidence is simple: Ohio, a red state by any measure, carried Issue 1 (2023) at 57% for. In 2022, JD Vance won Ohio at 53%. I think based on that, it's reasonable to say that in Ohio Issue 1 carried by 10% over its baseline.

I'm a Republican. I'm not these Republicans. They've lost their way, and this party needs to burn to the ground. The party of the Bull Moose it is not.

I'd also like to take a moment to acknowledge how fucking ridiculous Mike Johnson looks in his Trump Vance flight jacket. I didn't realize you could look like a bigger stooge than GWB did with his Mission Accomplished banner, but he managed to pull it off - and I say that as someone who thinks GWB isn't a horrible president (by comparison).

"Or, now hear me out, this is pump meet dump. The election betting odds they are referring to are determined by “prediction markets” such as Polymarket. According to Forbes:

> Prediction markets should work more or less like financial markets. Participants buy or sell financial instruments or contracts which Polymarket – a leading Prediction Market – refers to as “shares.” Others have called them “idea futures” or “event derivatives.” All of these terms are metaphorical. These contracts are really more like wagers that pay off based on a particular outcome. However, unlike most simple wagers, they are tradable, and are sometimes referred to as “options” 

That means you can basically trade bets like you would futures options for pork bellies (pun intended). If you know about options trading (if you don’t, school up), options have an expiration date. On that date you should only still own an option if you need to buy or sell the underlying asset (ie the pork bellies, bushels of wheat, etc.).  There’s no underlying asset in the case of an election.

So if you want to make money you need to sell your futures contracts before the Election/Pay day. Bro trader in France pumped the options on trump, probably with the help of his supporters, and now needs to dump to make their payday come true.

But Democratic analyst Simon Rosenberg, who predicted the arrival of these polls weeks before they appeared, is calling them out — along with sites like **FiveThirtyEight, which acknowledges the polls are bad data, but includes them anyway.**

“Since late August more than 70 right-aligned polls have been dropped into the polling averages,” Rosenberg writes. “The two states that have been worked the hardest are North Carolina and Pennsylvania. **In October of the 27 Presidential polls released in Pennsylvania, 16 are from right-aligned pollsters, a majority.**”

"The issue is less that pollsters lack integrity - although some are just partisans trying to achieve a certain political outcome - and more that no one knows what the exact nonresponse bias is. They have to figure out how they're going to adjust for that.

To make those adjustments, they're essentially making a prediction about what will happen in the election, and other polls can help them make that prediction. So things get ""herded"" toward rhe consensus.

Selzer, I believe, still does tons of un-persin interviews, and the organization knows Iowa inside and out -- so she is less prone to getting nonresponse, less prone to have biased nonresponse, and more capable of creating a model of the situation that doesn't heavily rely on the conventional wisdom.

However, because of her past reliability *and* this poll’s dramatic difference from others, she’s making national headlines for it.

"Polling is and always has been about applying assumptions to the Raw numbers. 

Supposed to you have a poll of a thousand random people in North carolina. Ignore the mechanism for the moment. 

You get numeric responses and demographic data. But then you realize you had 380 African-American respondents to your poll. 

Well that's not going to be right. North Carolina is only 22% african-american. So your poll is going to be skewed based on the inadvertent oversampling of african-americans.   

So you weght the results of your poll to account for the oversampling. 

You also see that the ages in your poll skewed older than average. Maybe it's because young people don't answer their phones when a strange number calls.  So you weight the responses to account for that undersampling of young people. 

And then you have the question of how you translate your raw pole responses into actual election data when no one knows exactly what voter turnout numbers you're going to look like. See you make some assumptions about voter turnout and apply those to create a likely voters result. 

If you apply those assumptions and get a result that's in the ballpark of what other people are getting, you assume that you were probably fairly accurate. 

On the other hand, if you get a result that's 10% points off, you are more likely to question your result.  

It's scientific of A Sort but it's all about hypothesis compared to the final vote. And that's the tricky part because you can't know whether you are predictions or assumptions are accurate until we get to the final vote.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Across the number of polls we've seen, there should be more outliers in both directions. The lack of them is what makes the herding obvious. The reasons for the herding aren't really important, only that they devalue the polls.

The interesting point with the Selzer poll is that it is an outlier from probably the most consistently accurate and independent pollster in the business. That makes space for an argument that it should carry *more* credibility than the herded results, which we basically know aren't based on sound data.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"This is anecdotal and I'm biased BUT:


Trump's performance in 2016 and 2020 were nearly identical (he barely won, then barely lost), so his support was pretty sticky.


Then AFTER the 2020 election he orchestrated an insurrection, his party and Supreme Court choices started banning abortions and most of his own cabinet says he's a threat to our Republic and cannot be given back power.


It seems he's gained ground in young, low propensity voters and almost certainly gets a boost from racists and exists compared to when 2 white males were the choices. However, I generally think he already had that vote locked in anyway.


The 2022 mid-terms surprised in favor of Democrats pretty much everywhere.


I simply don't see how Trump being on the ballot is going to improve upon that when Dems tend to do better in Presidential elections compared to midterms, the midterms surprised for Democrats, and in the last elections he hadn't yet committed insurrection, become a convicted felon, stolen national security secrets, or been tied to banning abortion yet.


Not to mention the economy is strong, unemployment low, inflation normalized and markets at record highs, which favors the incumbent party.


It just doesn't add up to me. I know multiple Reoublicans who voted for him once or twice and will still be voting down ballot for Republicans, but are voting for Harris. These coworkers, friends and family have never once voted for a Democrat in their lives.


Yet I know of no one that is switching to Trump from voting Democrat their whole lives. Even ones that were Bernie supporters and didn't vote for Hillary (generally by not voting) are voting for Harris.

Not sure if that’s still possible or if the gap has closed any. If it’s still around later tonight I might figure out my VPN situation and take advantage of some free money. 

I guess that’s the one advantage of the blockchain “democratization” of betting markets like Polymarket. Since it’s not a bookie in the traditional sense where a bookie would constantly be changing the odds to try to get equal money on both sides of a bet (all while having a Vig built in), Polymarket odds only change as a function of people actually buying the smart contracts. 

So if you have a bunch of right-wing rich assholes that want to skew the odds to make Trump look better by buying a bunch of Trump-to-win smart contracts and increasing the price of those contracts (and as a result, increasing his implied odds); then arbitrage bettors can take hella advantage.

This man, a supervisor of a division of law enforcement officials, is saying if you don’t vote a certain way he will not respond or do his job… he is a supervisor and he speaks for his division so now it is a declarative statement for the officers under him. 

So if you live in the community where he and his department serve you are being told (days prior to an election) if you don’t vote for Donald Trump the police will NOT help or assist you. This is clear voter intimidation and he should be removed from office immediately and charged federally.

Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales (2005): The Court ruled that police do not have a constitutional duty to protect a woman and her children from her estranged husband, even though a court had issued a protective order against him.

Warren v. District of Columbia (1981): The District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that police do not owe a specific duty to provide police services to specific citizens based on the public duty doctrine. This decision was later affirmed by the Supreme Court.

In 2022, the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that police could not be held liable for failing to protect students in the 2018 Parkland, Florida school shooting.

There are always always small groups of extremists in every country. Sometimes, they get an effective mouthpiece like trump and grow. Their supporting media will distort the truth and eventually, they will succeed in rising to power or they will fail. 

It happens all the time all over the world. The better the democracy, the harder is it for them to succeed. 

In this case it appears that they will fail. When they do, they will splinter and the GOP will be replaced with something more aligned to the people. The more extreme groups will splinter and form domestic terrorist cells as an outlet for the anger that has been fed to them over the last decade (or more).

I’d go on but Trump is exhausting and I just can’t wait to see him very publicly rejected a 3rd time with not just a threepeat loss of the popular vote but a second loss of the electoral college.

A savvy camera operator fact checked Donald Trump live.

During his rally in Greensboro, N.C. on Saturday night, Donald Trump bragged, “We have had the biggest rallies in the history of any country, and every rally is full. You do not have any seats that are empty. You did not have anything.”

But immediately after that comment, a cameraman for NTD.com smartly panned the stadium, zooming in on sections of empty seats and people exiting the arena, although it’s unclear whether those attendees are leaving the venue entirely.

Many of them will not be able to handle a black woman president. It will permanently dislodge them from polite discourse and rationality.

"There's a MAGA supporter somewhere who is frustrated because the libs keep making a big deal over Trump's rally crowd sizes instead of more substantive things.

But Trump is to blame for this.  Trump is the one who makes a big deal over his rally crowd sizes.  The ""libs"" are just riffing on that.  If MAGA folks want them to stop, they should tell Trump to stop bringing it up so much.

Trump has the power to be a ""substantive"" statesman rather than a buffoon. He could hire good speech writers and actually give the kind of compelling speeches at these rallies that would draw big crowds at future rallies. 

But instead, what does he do?  He wastes everyone's time complaining about microphones and how he isn't going to pay people. [He complains about his hair.](https://www.the-express.com/news/politics/153476/trump-pauses-rally-meltdown-bad-hair-day.)  [He says patently weird things.](https://www.yahoo.com/news/slurring-trump-rambles-aimlessly-biden-030529862.html).  And, as the camera person has shown us, he tells the kind of blatant lies that only a pathological liar would tell.

I already know how MAGAs will defend Trump.  ""He's probably unable to see all the empty seats because the lights from the stage are blinding him! LEAVE HIM ALONE!""

Why would we want to elect someone who is too blinded by the limelight to see what's right in front of him?  Whether literally or metaphorically, it's not a good look.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"I believe that no matter what happens, the country deserves what it gets at this point. It's tolerated, cooperated with, and allowed abuses and expansions of governmental power and corruption for far too long and the fact that Trump is possible is a result of this.

He's promising to ban vaccines, get fluoride out of the water, destroy healthcare, set women's rights back 100 years, imprison gay people, and put one of the worst oligarchs in charge of dismantling the federal government even though he came and worked here illegally. 

Only a nation of selfish, stupid assholes could vote for this guy and the fact that it's so close that it's a nail-biter shows that we have a lot of stupid, selfish, violent assholes and lunatics out there.  Rather than admit he might lose an election, he's already making excuses for losing, including telling the part of the country that has formed a cult around him that he can't lose because it would be ""cheating"" if he loses.

Meanwhile, his voters are out there setting ballots on fire, they're trying to file lawsuits instead of letting the election happen as it's supposed to, they're making up nonsensical rules that would allow them to basically throw the results out if he loses.

His life would have been so much better if he'd just decided *not* to be all of our problem and stay out of politics. And so would our lives.,2024_11_04,06_23_09

Damn he's looking rough.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Damn, dude is really letting the desperation show. If he had to keep this up much longer he'd definitely be badmouthing the towns he's campaigning in. I can totally see him let slip a ""I came to this town, let's be honest it's not a nice town. I'm sure you like it but it's not nearly as nice as the places I live"" kinda line. 

He absolutely thinks ""I dragged myself out to your shit hole town so you owe me your vote""",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Seemed to me he got more desperate when the dems started sharing the message to women that ""you know your vote is secret.""

Now the MAGAs are worried their red hat wearing subservient wives are gonna vote for Kamala without them knowing.  

THAT really struck a nerve.  I love it.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
That crowd looks genuinely bored,2024_11_04,06_23_09
I mean celebrity endorsements are coming left and right. Heck Jennifer Lawrence went door knocking. He’s getting desperate. I think he will try to claim some excuse to declare we need to redo it or something like let someone who will pardon him run. We all know it won’t work but he’s getting desperate.,2024_11_04,06_23_09

Those crawlers are insane.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
If he wasn't such an immediate threat to the country and the world I could almost enjoy this as cringe comedy.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
Not a word in that rant about policy or what he’d do for his constituency and the country. Just babbling about saving his own ass from legal woes.,2024_11_04,06_23_09

He can t get competent people and he won't pay for backup equipment. He isn't putting money and resources into organizing and preparation. Harris's mics aren't failing because she knows the value of preparedness.,2024_11_04,06_23_09

In order to continue to criticize the cameraman after that, they would have to acknowledge that the arena actually was mostly empty.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"The cameraman was most likely a college student contracted to do events at the Greensboro Coliseum. Funnily enough, basically every college in Greensboro is super liberal (UNCG is the most liberal UNC public school campus, NCA&T is the largest HBCU in the nation) except for Elon, which is super small and is 50/50 like most private liberal arts colleges in North Carolina. ",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"But most cameraman for a venue like that are freelance, and that venue will never be getting Trump back anyway, so really nothing will happen to them.

Plus, the live event community is overwhelmingly liberal aside from a few outliers, so if anything he or she has garner themselves for more work if they choose to advertise it .  Camera op are so in demand that chances are even a right leading venue won’t look into who they are as long as they have the qualifications",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"> although it’s unclear whether those attendees are leaving the venue entirely.

They cut the livestream when they noticed what he was doing.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
I can't help but think this sort of camera work is what someone who doesn't pay their bills gets for their shitty business practices.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
Probably a relative of the sound guy he threatened at the last rally. You really shouldn't fuck with the workers.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
Nah he’s gonna try and sue him as well.,2024_11_04,06_23_09

I will love for that to happen but lets get real. The records for any properly contested election are 49 states won (set by Nixon in 72' and repeated by Reagen in 84') and 61.1% of the popular vote (set by Johnson in 64')

The country is too divided for Harris to win all 50 states or get 61.2% of the popular vote.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"> MAGA business 

Yeah not done with the GOP as there will always be a rightwing business owners party.   Tbf the GOP will remain competitive overall even if Harris wins. 

Trump will not return if he loses (he would be 82), but the GOP will just rebrand MAGA with maybe a sensible foreign policy to lure the non-Trumpers.  They’ll only slightly alter the mass deportation plan and “project 2025” will become “suggestion box 2029”.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

It’s not possible to ignore cold simple reality. Jean-Paul Sartre summed it up best with his words about about the anti-Semite:

“Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”

This narrative hasn't been 100% proven, but it seems realistic to me.  Trump clearly doesn't like politics, he just likes attention and grifting.

Really? Even after the jokes about black supporters ‘carving watermelons’ at his rally?,2024_11_04,06_23_09
">According to the final national NBC News poll of the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, is only earning 9 percent of Black support, lower than the 12 percent he received during the 2020 presidential election when he ran against Joe Biden.

>Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, leads Black voters with 87 percent, NBC News’ poll shows.

"“Well, as a Black person” (👋🏾) a Black woman in particular, the only possible trump “supporters” I've ever met are “Both-Siders” that defend him or think he's funny or claim the economy was better under him, but don't vote or vote third party in protest. Good luck with that one. 

On the other hand, the rest of us (again, personal anecdote) are voting for Harris. Most of us voted early. I 100% believe there are additional trump supporters, but they don't talk about it publicly. I'm not just speaking as a Texas transplant, because I’m a Virginia native, but I also know quite a few people along the east coast (mainly D.C.) and a couple of Black people in the midwest. If they did or plan to vote for him, they don't talk about it.

Many people with this opinion also just don’t vote.

"Fundamentally a lot of blacks are fairly aligned with social conservative thought.  They don't like LGBT+, are fairly religous, and believe in more paternal thought.  So the republicans courting them makes sense as if that demographic switched or became a swing voting group, it would be hard for Democrats to win.  
  
The consistent problem they run into is 2 fold: 1.  blacks are in general in favor of social programs as they're group is still dealing with massive issuesin their community.  So they would like to have social programs to help their group try to rise above.  I honestly think this could be overcome but.... 

The biggest (and not surprising) issue is the racism.  They can't court black people because a great majority of their people use blacks as the boogy man for various social, economic, and poltical woes.  So if they actually were to try to court blacks a lot of their base will see it as a betrayal and start to not vote making it a net loss.    


This makes it fairly clear to most blacks that even if you are conservative minded, democrats are the only of the two parties that makes sense.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

If you twist the facts enough, you could argue there is a kernel of truth here because there was a warning 2 years before that his unit _could_ eventually be deployed. Not “will be”, “could be”.  He served 24-years including a stint where he reenlisted after 9/11 which meant he could have been called up at any time. 

He retired to run for office. Not to avoid combat. 

However you want to twist the facts I’ll take that over Trump getting his doctor to say he had bone spurs so he could avoid the draft.

"As a lawyer... we actually need lawyers there.  We are trained in how to reason through something to all possible conclusions, and that is a fundamentally critical skill for the actual job of voting on legislation.  

But, we also need more of a certain type of lawyer.  Really, what we need is people who have the written description of what a lawyer is supposed to be, someone who follows our basic rules of ""diligence and competence"" and also the rules that we are more known for ignoring, such as civility and professionalism.  

Many lawyers in government fail at rule one, competence, because they tend to have no freaking clue what they are talking about when it comes to the Constitution.  I would say that at best, conservatives are lying 80% of the time when they claim that something is or is not constitutional, and that is truly bizarre.  I remember sitting in my first constitutional law class and wondering how on earth anyone could possibly exit the class believing in GOP talking points, and yet the Federalist Society and other things actually exist and are full of lawyers who took and ignored con law 1.  But then I took a few upper level con law classes and I guess you could say it got worse.  Dang near nobody in politics speaks correctly about executive power, except for Obama and Biden, who have been really impressive in their deference to the Constitution, especially when their move was compliant and controversial.  There are things that each of them did that I do not personally like but where I am impressed by how they followed the rules.  They were, after all, both lawyers, just like Hillary and Kamala, and Bill Clinton and I suspect most other Democratic Presidents, though I don't really want to take the time to count.  I don't know why I haven't memorized that; I can confirm that prior to Trump, every President had served as a governor, senator (or at least VP), or general back more than a century, and really all of those jobs are generally dominated by lawyers just by nature.  We have relevant training, and it's fair to say that a majority of people who leave high school intending to become politicians go to law school specifically to learn the trade.  Lawyers are to government as engineers are to manufacturing, and yet, nobody complains when there are too many engineers running businesses.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Teenage babysitters get paid like 10 bucks an hour. A teacher supervises and instructs 25 kids for 6 hours per day, drawing on specialized knowledge that they trained for years to teach. Let's pretend they got paid 10 bucks per hour per kid.

25 kids x 10 bucks an hour x 6 hours teaching per day = $1500 per day

$1500 x 180 days per year (typical minimum number of school days) = $270,000 per year

And that's just for hours actually giving instruction. This doesn't factor in hours spent on lesson plans, grading papers, parent teacher conferences, staff meetings, and all the other things these people do every day. $400k is a conservative valuation on all of this time and effort.

To me the ideal representative would have a range of competences, with law being one of the core ones.

Kind of a separate issue back in recent news is the role of experts and career regulators - ideally, a statute should be left blank as to specific scientific details, such as the numbers that are set as limits in certain regulations, with the Executive Branch regulatory process spelling out those details with more input from scientists than lawyers.  This should actually be a team process, with the ""office"" of the legislator containing all of these advisors and the actual representative being kind of the leader of that team but ultimately following its collective advice.  Some are set up that way, but there is no law really requiring them to consistently do so.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"CEOs are paid in a fairly irrational way.  There is not necessarily any correlation between their compensation and their competence.  It's more political than politics and it's debatable how much work many of them even do.  

Teachers perform fundamentally important work.  It is a physically hard job, with variable hours that can be extremely arduous, and are often untracked for compensation.  Most teachers are salaried, and get no overtime pay, but often do hours and hours of work at home throughout the year, with certain time periods and deadlines being more extreme.  There is a reverse variation to that, as well; some teachers may get more efficient with their prep work over time, but the best ones still devote more time than they are paid for even after they've developed their curricula very thoroughly.  And of course, that doesn't really work forever for anyone, as textbooks and standardized tests are always changing along with curriculum standards that filter in sometimes confusing ways between agencies and layers of democracy.  A teacher could spend five years refining a curriculum only for the local school board to decide for some arbitrary reason to switch textbooks and shake everything up, and there is never compensation for that.

The biggest problem is how teacher salaries are set, though.  This is because schools are primarily funded by local property taxes, and usually approved in public votes.  It's very hard to get the majority of voters to agree to raises for teachers, and the majority of voters often don't seem to understand how salaries should work.  If you look at how it works and who gets to vote, a lot of the voters don't have kids so see paying teachers as a burden and not worthwhile.  Then you've got residents who do have kids but don't make that much money... often, the families of grade school kids have below median household incomes, and so they themselves might not want to vote for a raise that has some teachers getting paid more than they do.  

I think it seems likely that these structural factors tend to put downward pressure on school boards when setting teacher pay, and also make the problem very hard to solve.  I personally think the whole system of funding needs to change.  Schools should not be funded by local taxes that individuals can directly vote to lower.  

There are a number of ways to reform this.  I think that the simplest, and this has been done in a handful of states, is to set the salaries according to an index that is set at the state level, taking that power away from the local taxpayer.  Of course, I can hear immediately the replies about how it's fundamentally wrong to take power away from the local taxpayer... and unfortunately, it takes longe than a bumper sticker to explain the problem.  So, it's quite hard to accomplish.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

It has been pretty heartbreaking, yeah... but what did it for me was a conversation I had in a remote place.  Whitehorse, Yukon, at a campground.  Some guy invited me to his campfire and started a conversation, and inevitably we ended up talking about politics.  He was from something like Wyoming or Montana, and ultimately we had a good conversation in which he said that he had learned a lot from me and would consider my ideas the next time he planned on voting.  But he said one detail that sealed it for me as pointless to run.  He said ""You have some really good and important ideas, but when you first started talking, I thought you were nuts for about the first five minutes.""  And that right there means I can't be a viable candidate.  You don't get five minutes with a voter.  Your position has to be compelling within - and this is real research - 7 seconds, or the voter stops paying attention.  That is a really old statistic too, from a study that I read in 2011.  It's probably worse now, as I see in my TikTok stats that the average view time on videos generally is under 5 seconds.  That's how long you get before someone writes you off forever.

Borrowed from guess who? He is more of a thief than a genius.

[Fake video of Georgia voter fraud is Russian misinformation, US officials say](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/01/georgia-voter-fraud-video-fake-russia/75993122007/)


Friday’s disclosure follows the ODNI’s public attribution of three other fake videos in recent weeks to Russia. They included one falsely accusing Harris of paralyzing a teenage girl in a hit and run and another falsely accusing her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, of sexual abuse.

A third fake video made and circulated by Russia purported to show pro-Harris voters illegally ripping up Trump mail-in ballots in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, an ODNI official said.

“This Russian activity is part of Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans,” ODNI said. It was the latest of several election updates warning Americans of what it describes as “foreign malign influence operations.”

The Elon Musk factor
The video is the latest salvo in an intensifying Kremlin campaign to smear Vice President Harris and boost what intelligence officials say is Vladimir Putin’s preferred candidate, former President Donald Trump, in the waning days of the razor-close Nov. 5 election.

[Investigating Musk’s far-fetched claim about Democrats importing voters](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd5l0d3794o)


Since endorsing Donald Trump for president in July, Elon Musk - the owner of X - has posted about the US election hundreds of times, attracting more than four billion views.
BBC Verify, working with data firm Node XL, analysed all of his posts since then - over 8,000 - and searched for key words to track the election issues he has been posting about most to his 200 million followers.
Immigration and voting emerge as key themes with Mr Musk engaging with misinformation online about “illegal aliens” voting in this election.
He has also claimed repeatedly that Democrats have been “importing” immigrants who will vote for them in future elections.

Among the narratives being pushed in the community is one that has become a pet conspiracy theory of Musk’s. The SpaceX CEO has loudly and oftenmade the false claim that the Biden administration was “importing voters” in the form of “unvetted illegal immigrants”. In the last few days, a Musk-funded super Pac has been pushing a fake pro-Kamala Harris initiative called Project 2028. The initiative has posted fake pro-Harris ads and sent texts to voters that include claims that Harris will be opening the country’s borders and is pushing for undocumented immigrants to be able to vote. Non-citizens are not allowed to vote in the US, and there is no available evidence they are voting in droves as claimed. Users in the community are sharing videosthey say provides evidence that Democrats are “bussing” undocumented immigrants to cast votes in their favor.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Ken Paxton has already started ratfucking this election in advance of election day. He announced that he is ""investigating"" the manufacturer of the voting machines, Dominion. 


 There's a law in Texas that gives the government the ability to throw out any votes that they think are ""suspicious"" and ""redo"" an election (as long as the population of the county the votes are from is over 2.7 million). 


 Why 2.7 million, you may ask? That's the break off that separated other counties from Harris County, which is where Houston is. Basically, the GOP has a law that will specifically allow them to throw all votes away from Houston. 


 They bragged about throwing away a million votes in 2020, and that if they hadn't, Texas would have gone to Biden.

"So trump won Texas by 5.5 points in 2020. He won Iowa by 8 points in 2020. That poll in Iowa that just came out put Harris up by 3 points there, or an 11 point swing from 2020, of the numbers actually translate to votes (big if, I realize). What's interesting about the Iowa poll to me is that Iowa doesn't exist in total isolation. If Harris truly has swung the electorate 11 points since 2020 in Iowa, she's almost certainly swung it in other states as well, and depending on demographics, by wider or narrow margins. Iowa is whiter than Texas, which means a bigger percentage of Iowa's population is Trump's core demographic. That, combined with an historically unpopular Senator running on the same ticket as Trump, and I'm starting to see a real possibility that Texas turns blue this year. 

I've been saying since 2016 that Texas would flip in 2028 regardless just because of shifting demographics, but the perfect storm of Cruz being a weird, awful human (well, allegedly human) while having a popular, charismatic opponent, plus the Dobbs decision, plus the complete lack of enthusiasm for team Trump this cycle, and I think there's a very real chance it could happen in 2024. Obviously it's still a bit of a long shot, but it's much less of a long shot than I'd have said it was a week ago.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"I’ve been following our early voter numbers compared to 2020 and 2016 (2020 is an outlier year because we had an extra week of EV and expanded mail-in ballots) as well as demographics of early voters.

What I can tell you, Texas already beat both the number and percentage of voter turnout in 2016 this year. At 8.5M we’re behind 2020’s number (remember there was one more week), but if 2020 had been like any other year Texas early voting is ahead. Considering in 2016 4M showed up on Election Day almost doubling the votes, in 2020 about 2M showed up, about 13% of total vote. Looking at both those years and making some adjustments for the outlier year, total voter turnout should be between 53%-88%, the average being 74% which would beat 2020’s recent record year. 

Also keep in mind Texas added 1.7M registered voters between 2020 and 2024, so the turnout percentage might stay the same, but total votes cast will likely exceed 2020.

Why does that matter? What we’ve seen is that when more people turnout to vote the higher the chance for democrats, specifically in Texas. Yes, they haven’t won Senate or President since 1992, but the margins are shrinking.

Also demographically, our age and gender demographics look very similar to Georgia’s in 2020, minor exception early vote still has the under 29’s a bit lower than  Georgia. Women are way out voting men, even higher than the national average. 

Last thing 18% of Republicans voted for Haley in the primaries. I ran some numbers, if independents break even 1% more for Dems than 2020, Democrats go all in on blue, and that 18% of Haley voters don’t vote for Trump, the race could look like this 50% - 48% Kamala, a difference of about 200K votes, if vote total stays the same as 2020. 

I dabble in data analysis at my job, so this is not my forte especially political data, but I’ve lived in Texas for 15 years and do understand basic premise of measuring the information. It is not impossible for this to happen. 

I think it could also potentially go the other way for Trump. At minimum it should be a close race. 

The big question, honestly is this, we have very high turnout of suburban voters, who are they breaking for in Texas? I think that will be the big decider. 

No matter what I’ve said or the pollsters, go out and vote!! Nothing matters but the count on Election Day.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"What is truly awful is that the current conservative movement is such a toxic ideology that I would be willing to comfortably bet a large amount of money that there will be a headline of domestic abuse and/or an actual murder that happens because of this movement.

It doesn't matter that there is literally no way for the husband to have proof. Modern conservatives haven't needed proof of anything for them to be moved towards violence. If they *feel* it, they believe it.

So if some poor woman's husband *feels* like their partner voted against Trump, that's enough of a justification to do whatever they want. 

Add in that Trump *himself* routinely advocates for violence for anyone who is against him (protestors at rallies, people in the press, for God's sake, he literally just said he'd have Liz Cheney executed by firing squad), and it is almost a certainty that a female partner of a MAGA male will be the victim of violence.

">I was born into a family that didn’t discuss politics at all, only religion,

The difference being what exactly?  Christianity in it's foundational theological framework is 100% political.  Everyone in your group 'goes to heaven' everyone else 'goes to hell'.  A basic theological concept is so-called 'saving grace' stating that faith not works confer entrance to eternal bliss or the lack thereof conferring eternal damnation.

Faith has always been shown or proven by loyalty to either the religion or the church or both.  Loyalty confreres eternal reward.

What if deeds were to be the case?  Might people try harder to be good to one another?  While christians claim that their religion puts that requirement to its devotees, loyalty to the church/religion is the ***real*** substance.

But you have to cope with the consequences of what you’ve done and so do millions of American women, even ones who didn’t vote for him.” She couldn’t understand why I told her I didn’t want to be friends with her anymore because she regretted her choice after all!

A higher percentage of white women voted for Trump the second time, but a lower percentage of white men did.

Even in the most recent Iowa poll that is the gold standard for Iowa predictions, Kamala wins, but women between 35 and 55 are voting for Trump.

"I had a coworker tell me that he voted for Obama and Biden, but that he's voting for Trump this year because ""I just don't think she's that smart, she can't even speak properly and laughs at everything"" and ""the economy"". I took that to mean he's just sexist and doesn't want to vote for a woman, because Trump objectively is worse at both.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of guys out there that just can't get over the fact that a woman can be smarter than them and lead just as well as a man. They are justifying it to themselves with bullshit to make themselves feel better.

"He was.  But at the same time he had a strategy of talking out of every side of his mouth.  Trump would promise to do whatever he thought the group in front of him wanted to hear. Never mind if it completely contradicted what he told the last group an hour earlier. 

While it’s almost a given that “candidates lie,” I think the American public was unprepared for this level of shamelessness.  They really expected them to try to appear to be honest even if they couldn’t or ultimately wouldn’t follow through. 

So Trump really became a Rorschach candidate.  Unable to determine what he wanted from all of the contradictory stories, people just assumed his “real” positions were whatever theirs were. 

Now there is a massive record as to just what a piece of shit he is.  “No taxes on tips / overtime / whatever else you might be taxed on” is empty promises and will be a full on “infrastructure week will be in 2 weeks” situation while “I will put Liz Cheney, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in front of a firing squad”.

Not *all* Republican women believe this. But the more religious they are, the more likely they are to believe it and be ""traditional"" wives who obey their husbands 100%.

That's why people are reminding women their vote is private. Liberal women who are Democrats don't need this reminder. They've voted their own conscience for decades.

Black men are being urged to vote for Kamala because [Dr. Cornel West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornel_West) is on the ballot in some states. He is a very well-regarded philosopher, theologian, political activist, politician, social critic, and public intellectual who is black.

Muslims, I assume, are being called on because some are considering Trump because of what's going on in Gaza.

""Minority of the week."" Wow. Okay.

ALL groups are being called to vote for Harris. Young voters. Rich voters. Minority voters. 

As in all marketing, they are different demographic groups with different priorities and reasons for what they do. They can often be addressed in large numbers in a single location. For instance rich groups in NYC. Young groups in college towns. Minority groups in cities with a large population of that group.

"All of these articles claiming small leads for either candidate are utter bullshit. The minimum margin of error for a poll is going to be around 4 points. But when you add in the fact that pollsters also apply a lot of corrections (e.g. guessing what voter turnout will be for each demographic group), the real margin of error is far larger. In single-state polls like Pennsylvania or Iowa, I wouldn't be surprised if the polls are off by 6+ points, because the reality is it is really f###ing hard to forecast elections accurately",2024_11_04,06_23_09

This year, it seems the prevailing wisdom is that part of the closeness is down to those pollsters leaning on “it’s a toss up!” since it allows them to be wrong in a way that minimizes how much they look like schmucks for getting things wrong if they turn the whole thing into one data-toward shrug emoji.

"15-25% based on what? If that happened she’d flip an insane number of red states. 

She only needs a fraction of that in the key states if turnout is good. Just 1% would probably be more than enough to comfortably win everything Biden won in 2020. Every single person who voted Trump in 2020 who votes Harris is a 2 point swing really. 

They might be a small % of all 2020 Trump voters but every single one who switches is massive and it won’t take many too ensure a solid victory. 

I don’t think you can use Trump signs or whatever on ground metric. The type of people switching are not going to be the diehards. They are typical GOP who are just tired of his nonsense and hearing about all of this. That silent block of voters is huge if enough switch.

"Reminder that Trump has said the following things:

On December 19th, 2020, he tweeted, ""Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election. Big protest in DC on January 6th.""

At a rally in AZ in August, 2024, Trump said, ""The only way they can do anything is if they cheat like hell, and we've been victims of that... We don't need the votes, we just want to make sure they don't cheat.""

In Michigan in September, he stated, ""If I lose - I'll tell you what, it's possible. Because they cheat. **That's the only way we're gonna lose, because they cheat.**""

Think about this. Trump is fanning the flames of disinformation by claiming the only way he loses is if the other side cheats. There is zero evidence to support this absurdity.

... If anyone looks at this and it *doesn't* raise red flags, then you're in a cult.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

">. I get why people outside the US would be more concerned about the outcome of the US election than even their own. 

Poilievre is a mini-Trump populist nightmare.

Let me tell you why women in Canada (ie: me) are equally as concerned about the upcoming election here: 

Contrary to popular belief, we do not currently have *any* enshrined abortion rights in Canada. That's also precisely why we have the most liberal access to abortion in the world. There are simply no laws governing it - it's not illegal, nor is it legal. 

What that also means is that there's nothing to overturn in order to ban abortion, or set limits on it. It just requires a majority government to unilaterally pass a law. 

The only reason it's been this way since R v. Morgentaler is that it's been a nuclear topic for any government since. With the populist creep over the border, that's no longer the case. 

There are currently ZERO pro-choice Conservative MPs. Not one. And they've already tried to sneak through legislation that would give fetuses personhood status (under the insulting guise of protecting pregnant women from abuse).

Edit to add: also, geographically speaking - do we want a Canadian PM who will fall in line with Trump and open up the Arctic ocean to Putin, putting our allies in Denmark at risk? Trump already has eyes on Greenland. 

Do we want a Canada that will diplomatically shift away from a Labour UK and closer to a Trump America? Do we want a Canada that will automatically side with Trump in trade disputes with Mexico?

Do we want a Canada that pulls its support for Ukraine, and halts peacekeeping missions in Cyprus, Sudan, the Congo, and Syria?",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"It's really hard to say.  The Trump voters are loud and unapologetic, and a lot of Harris voters are afraid to put a sign up because they don't want to have their house vandalized.  The Trump signs are also being bankrolled largely by one individual who is happily dropping off piles of signs at people's houses.

I had canvassers come to my house today, and they happily gave me a Harris sign. I think this is the first time I've ever had canvassers come around with signs, so that's awesome.  But my house is now the only one on our street with a Harris sign, versus 3 Trump houses.

- Abortions save innocent lives
- Abortions prevent **innocent infants from being forcibly born only to suffer for hours before passing away**
- Abortions save mothers who already have children and their next wanted pregnancy risks their life by going sceptic
- Abortions prevent women from being murdered by partners who don't want them pregnant 
- Abortions prevent thousands of children from being forcibly born only to be neglected, abused, abandoned, or killed


Every child deserves to be born into or to a family that will love them and care for them. Abortions are healthcare.

"100% serious answer:

They know Trump is not great. They do. (Well, most of them. Some actually are that deluded.). But it always and forever goes back to messaging. They have been primed for literal decades to see Democrats as the enemy. So even though Trump is “flawed”, that’s better than “evil.” So he’s their guy.

Plus, it doesn’t hurt that they’re constantly immersing themselves in media that works overtime to excuse everything he does. An entire industry has been built around that because it’s effective.

But here’s the other bit: many so-called Christians are Christian because they feel like it elevates them above everyone else. They’re not “sinners”, or at least not sinners who will be eternally punished for it. They will be elevated above *those* sinners. They’re special. Trump’s rhetoric feeds into this “I’m special” worldview they have because he outright tells them that they are better than those others over there - it’s not coincidence that Trump’s targets are seen by his base as sinful even when it’s something the Bible never actually says a word on (like being trans, or *women* who seek an abortion since the only relevant passage there is the one where abortion was part of the priests’ ritual if the mother had cheated, but I digress). Christianity has primed them to believe this, which is why the American Christian church and Republicanism were able to mesh themselves together so thoroughly.

The collective message of both groups isn’t “let’s make the world better for everyone”, but “we rightly deserve the benefits of society because we are the good ones; those who are not part of our group are a danger to us and our way of life. They are not like us.”",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"In my view, a lot of it has to do with conservative media exploiting the ""disgust"" reaction conservatives are vulnerable to: https://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/2525-politics-and-maggots  
  
____  
  
Politics and maggots  (Yale 2009)  
___  
Pus, maggots, vomit, feces, rotten food: in almost every human society, people share a knee-jerk revulsion for certain substances. Now, Yale psychologist Paul Bloom and his colleagues have found that the level of disgust a person feels can predict his or her political orientation. In a word: **""We found that conservatives are more easily disgusted than liberals.""**  
  
Using a standard political orientation scale and the Disgust Sensitivity Scale -- also a standard psychological measuring tool, developed in 1994 to compare individuals' reactions to such things as monkey meat, gore, and sex with animals -- the researchers tested 181 adults across the country. They discovered a significant correlation between conservatism and strong feelings of being grossed out. The correlation also held among 91 Cornell undergraduates and was strongest when the political issues tested involved gay marriage or abortion. (The research appeared in June in Cognition and Emotion.)  
  
Early in our evolution, disgust may have functioned as a way to ward us away from things that were bad to eat. Today it plays out in disagreements over policy. While Bloom finds disgust a ""terribly corrosive emotion,"" and wishes we could abandon it in favor of rationality, he feels there's a risk in ignoring it. ""Our findings reinforce the importance of the emotions in policy and morality. A lot of these issues are still driven by the gut.""",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"It's complex, but the first factor I'd mention is that religion serves as a tribal substitute in our lives, it's a set of customs that define an in group and ""linked family of families"" as a video game character and his writer put it. You often feel comfortable going to that community for support, you know who's contributing. Many of those tribes have a difficult time including those coming in with the tide of American demographic change, they are *racist.* Trump's racist as shit, and most other Republican candidates before him would never say the quiet part out loud at least due to their agency in that demographic change: they *need* specifically illegal immigrants.

The second part is that American religious life is characterized by ""great awakenings,"" every forty to sixty years a wave of charisma and revitalization affects its Protestant and frequently Calvinistically derived Christian stock (Evangelicals). I personally think it's because they largely lack a source of religious authority such as a Pope or a Metropolitan or a ""Supreme Governor,"" so when the tent revivals and super preachers come once a generation or two there's no institutional defense. Trump hit right at the same time those people were feeling lost and looking for guidance, when church attendance was dropping (they call it ""the Great Falling Away""), so he became a *de facto* religious leader. He promises a return to the good old days, what so many yearn for in their hearts. It's so obviously a lie, but we rarely have defenses against lies we want to hear.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

I have found that I can treat all people with dignity and respect, and help my fellow humans, without having to subscribe to a dogma that pushes fear and control.

"This is pretty philosophical but I think that a lot of people struggle with coming to terms with existential absurdity. Some people can’t deal with the fact that our lives only have the meaning that we give them in an uncaring universe. So instead of some things just being random good fortune, it has to be something that was accomplished which implies control over one’s existence and is a repudiation of the random chaos of the universe. Like I guess the world might seem like a less scary place to some people if they can rationalize it as a thing that is totally controlable via their actions and intentions. Or maybe I’m reading to much into it 🤷",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"My entire father's working career was due to good fortune. If a random manager during the 70s hadn't seen him cutting meat in a shop and ask if he wanted to work for him. My dad would have never told him he didn't actually have a license and just put on the job so the owner could save money, which caused that manager to pay for my dad to go get tested and get his actual license. And then my father wouldn't have been able to go start at HEB (We are Texan) as a meat cutter with that manager. And he wouldn't have been able to work his way up with only a High School education to becoming a Manager of Seafood and keep that position his entire life. 

But if you ask my mother and father, it was because of God and his work ethic that God gave him. Not the absolute dumb luck of 1) randomly being poached by a manager and 2) not having that manager actually decide to legally fuck my father for being an unlicensed meat cutter.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"> That’s because the old republican evil was still willing to respect the rule of law, was willing to work across the aisle and compromise, was focused predominantly on economic issues as opposed to social issues, and their leadership liked to appear intellectual

...maybe more than Trump, but not really. Karl Rove and Dick Cheney were definitely significant driving forces in how we got to where we are today. They are still awful human beings. It's just that the Trump administration was just so much worse than anyone before him.

To me, the biggest difference is that he made discourse so much worse, and made Americans hate each other more than ever before, all for his benefit. How politics is played has changed forever for the worse, and civility is pretty close to dead. And what's worse is the media continue to play into his hand because that's what's profitable for them.

An America divided is their goal and what they've exploited, whereas Cheney/Bush/Rove/Rumsfeld only cared about advancing their agenda. Granted their agenda was pretty awful, but the difference is Trump and his cultists have made our society so much worse in so many ways.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

The answer for any Christian who reads the Gospel is ""No."" We live in a physical world, and a physical world involves tradeoffs and luck. It involves processes and interactions - sometimes processes break down and sometimes interactions result in a winner and a loser.

What stays with me most now are using logic for pretty much everything, objective vs subjective observations, and to ALWAYS be able to back up my arguments with supporting facts. I still remember stressing tf out over writing essays! Plagiarism was a big deal back then, so either you had to footnote your writing if you took ideas from another source, and if you had your own thoughts/opinions, you STILL had to support them with some facts or arguments. 

I’m genuinely SHOCKED that this is apparently not the norm within large parts of the US.

Roan really showed her age and immaturity when she went off on TikTok about it.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"I'll probably be downvoted, but oh well.

Roan is disappointing on many levels, IMHO.

She's co-opted drag queen looks for sale, but doesn't really show public support in ways that matter for drag artists.  Her musical skills and performances are actually kind of average beyond the ""look how I can dress!"" act.

It feels like an entitled dressup for eyeballs, where she is ignorant about the fact that she's representing a group of people who are very much under attack by Republicans and supported by Democrats.  But I don't see how she supports drag performers, despite all the benefit she gets for adopting their looks in performances.  An act or two comes out as supporting acts at her concerts now, but she doesn't talk or do anything else to consistently to help the people whose looks help sell her music.

She doesn't want to be fit into a box politically, but dropped the Biden White House invitation due to politics.

On that point, she won't support the only US political party that actually has been trying to ensure equality and special consideration for belequered minority groups over the years, including LGBTQ+, for someone who likes to drop mentions about her being gay somewhat regularly.

She's highly sensitive about criticism or even feedback that she doesn't feel is positive.  Fame came on fast, but again part of it is because of the persona she's adopted that is from other groups and which she uses to sell her act

Honestly, she comes off as an entitled white bisexual who wants to pick and choose which segment in LGBTQ+ matters while seeking PR benefits by alignment with them, and that segment appears kind of narrow and revolves around herself in interviews.  She's young, appears naive and doesn't understand how to look at the bigger picture.

I also feel this ""sincere"" thing is a double standard people have for women, and obviously I was guilty of this in 2020. Like did people say Obama, McCain,  Romney, Bush, or Gore had problems sounding sincere? I don't remember ever hearing that about any of them.

The studio is smaller than most people realize, so an audience member might have trouble seeing a scene if it's on the farther side of their seats, or covered by sets, crew, cameras, etc. Some may see the surprises beforehand, but we all don't get the full reveal until we see it on the TVs that show what's on the live feed.

An example is last night's Duane Reade musical scene. The scene was done right in front of me, but I couldn't see much of it because of the sets so I didn't know that Pete Davidson was there until he showed up on the TVs. Also, there's an unwritten rule to save your cheering energy for the applause moments for greater affect on TV.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"It absolutely blows my mind how Covid was handled by the Republicans (and other conservative governments around the world).

I was 16 when 9/11 happened. I didn't know shit about politics back then, but it felt like the last moment in time when everyone was united. I even had a shirt with both the US and Canadian flags crossed that had some slogan like ""We are united as one"".

Of course they say the best way to unite people is to give them a common enemy.

Then many years later Covid happened, and I thought surely everyone would unite against this common enemy, right? This virus that doesn't care about your political affiliation, doesn't care about the colour of your skin, doesn't care about your gender, your sexual orientation, immigration status, citizenship, height, weight, how rich or poor you are, etc., it will kill you all the same.

Instead it was weaponized and used to divide people even further. It was literally made political even though it was an apolitical threat.

I truly don't think we'll ever be united again unless there's literally an alien invasion, and who even knows if that would do it. I don't know if the division in the US is recoverable. I hope it is.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

And there's definitely ZERO chance this begins via the plan of rounding up millions of migrants, whose countries won't allow them to be returned, which means they simply have to be detained in camps. 


In that interview last week that advisor said that they can round up entire families... even if the babies/children/dependents are natural born U.S. citizens.

"You are right about Catholics, but one of the big reasons Protestants exist is because they didn't like things that were outside the Bible (in addition to the whole church corruption thing). Catholics are at least more organized.

I would say evangelical Christianity, in particular, is more of a cult of personality, given that any person can claim to be a preacher and start their own church. No formal training or even uniform beliefs required. Catholics have their seminary schools and you can only be a priest if the church in Rome says so.

"I grew up in Iowa, spent nearly 40 years there before moving to Texas. My small town had 3,500 people, with a Co-op right in the middle of it.

Iowa is largely rural or smaller towns, with a strong Patriarchal tradition rooted in generational farming. They have traditional family and social values. The farmers are conservative but also exceedingly keen, not at all the rubes many expect. They're business owners in an extremely complicated business.

Over the last 30 or so years many farms have been purchased by commercial farming companies. Lots of smaller farmers sold outright (because their children went to college, moved away) and many continue to work the farm as employees.

Now privately owned farms are uncommon, and they fight hard to survive.

That's a bitter pill for many in the state.

They saw in Trump someone who at least appeared to hold those traditional values as much as they do, and out of frustration, anger at feeling cheated and forgotten they embraced him.

What they got instead were tariffs that killed their soybean contracts, subsidies meant to offset the loses which are expiring and those contracts are never coming back. That put a lot of hardship on a lot of farms, already struggling to survive.

The commercial farms are large enough to offset their losses and survive, or at the very least secure loans small farmers can't. The privately owned farms are fighting for their lives, with commercial farms waiting to swoop in like vultures.

Iowa farmers are tough, conservative to their core and some of the most stubborn people you will ever meet.

They don't like to admit they're wrong and rarely will, but one thing is certain above all:

When you piss off an Iowa farmer they will hold a grudge for the rest of their lives.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Selzer is the gold standard Iowa poll for a reason. With the exception of the 2018 governor election, her firm has correctly predicted the winner in every statewide race since the 2008 presidential election, and almost always within 1-2% of the actual result. 

Selzer was one of the first polls predicting Obama would win the 2008 Democratic caucus in Iowa, catching his late surge in support. They were also one of the only polls to predict Trump would win Iowa by a massive margin in 2016 (+7 predicted, +9.5 actual), catching a late surge when basically every other poll, including other reputable pollsters like Ipsos, Emerson, and Quinnipiac predicted a competitive election.

Even if we assume the 3.4% margin of error favors Trump *and* Selzer overestimated Harris by 2-3% (so Harris+3 is actually Trump +2 or +3), that’s a 5-6% reduction compared to 2020.

I have heard less about the abortion measure than I was expecting. Last time I checked the polls on that it was all over the place. Past history suggests it should bring out a lot of left leaning women which should have an impact on the top of this ticket but the polling hasn’t really shown that.

I was told that only sluts had abortions so I was conflicted and waited until the final weeks (10 weeks) because of that indoctrination. 

Well, I was told I needed to terminate because I had a blood clot a few months earlier and the chance of me surviving a pregnancy was slim, the fetus -
None. 

My sister had a fetus die at 20 weeks gestation. It was traumatic, mostly because of our evangelical parents shaming her for her D&C. She was 31 and long married at that time. 

Religious zealots have tunnel vision that aligns to their propaganda. Women aren’t having abortions for fun. D&C sucks; via pills or surgery, it is AWFUL.

But polls post-2016 wouldn’t be bullshit if you had an overwhelming amount of people voting for Kamala in a landslide. If you have a modern polling age where they’re doing as much as they can to account for the Trump factor, raising his score by a few points for a margin of error, and *that* reports in a landslide for Kamala, I would be inclined to believe that those results would transfer off to voting day, especially if she’s well beyond a margin of error.

"So you are admitting you don’t understand how economic policy and the economy works. Which is fine. But you should educate yourself before making baseless claims. 

First off, economic policy generally lags a few years before having a significant impact. So you wouldn’t have seen the effects of trump admin policies until near the end of his term, or even the start of Biden’s term. 

Secondly, trump was handed a booming economy from Obama. But trumps trade wars and policies eroded that economy, so that even before Covid, the economy had already taken a downturn. 

Covid also majorly screwed up the economy. And only due to Biden’s policies did we recover as quickly as we did. The trump administration seriously messed up the Covid response, which made the economy significantly worse than it would have been if they had followed the pandemic playbook created by the previous administration. 

And inflation was not caused by Biden. It was caused by trump trade wars, Covid, supply chain disruptions from the Panama Canal, and a lack of regulations on businesses allowing unmitigated price inflation. Biden policies have reduced inflation, and in fact the US experienced less inflation than most other countries. 

So blaming Biden for your economic situation is flat out wrong. You would be significantly worse off under a trump presidency.

Former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, unsure how much tax revenue would be collected, borrowed well over $1 trillion—but kept it in reserve, without ever spending it.

"The unifying thread behind trump support is not evangelicalism, or christianity. Almost 70% of americans identify as christian, if trump truly had the christian vote locked up, he would win all 50 states. 

The singular thread behind trump support is whiteness, and white supremacy. Christianity is just used as cover for white supremacy to instill its beliefs. There are literally millions of Christians who recognize and reject trump as a snake oil grifter, and understand he is the most non-christian to present himself as such. He doesn't believe in the bible or its teachings, [he's clearly never read it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERUngQUCsyE). He is a 'christian' that does not pray, that does not believe in redemption. That cheats on his wives, and sexually assaults women and children. He clearly does not believe in helping the poor, loving your neighbors, giving back to society or any of the actual teachings of christ. This is why whenever one tries to have a good faith debate with a trump supporter (be them christian or not), showing them evidence of what trump actually does (be it related to studying the bible, constitution, the first amendment, the second amendment, the economy, whatever), compared to what said trump supporter says matters to them, is fully disregarded despite the mountains of contrary evidence. Because those things are ultimately not what actually matters to trump supporters. 

What trump actually offers, is the upholding of the belief that whiteness is a natural good, and non-whites are evil. This is not new to GOP politics, but it has been decades since the mask was ripped off like this. The brazenness of it is what makes it so specifically attractive. People who were shamed for this racist mentality and had to hear it code-worded through things like 'busing rights', or 'welfare queens', suddenly had an outlet politician who shared and yelled their inner thoughts. They found a home in trump, but even more importantly they had a path to make their bigotry legal, to hurt the people they wanted to hurt. Trump offers the continuation of that historical white power that many white people yearn for the days of. Trump is not luring evangelicals to satan, he is simply empowering white supremacists in modern times.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

This is an interesting temptation that we often encounter in life. The desire for comfort, safety and protection is almost universal. In my career, I have greatly desired job protection, for example, but that is never guaranteed when you are committed to telling the truth. Diplomacy was never my strong suit and my working life has been a struggle. I wish it weren't that way, but over time it has taught me that sometimes security becomes more important to people than their own integrity.  
> 
> I see that in the evangelical support of Donald Trump. His offer of protection is clear, and something he discusses all the time. He promises to keep the Christians safe from the evil forces of liberalism. The left is coming for your guns, he tells them. They will persecute you for your Christian faith. Your children are in danger of conversion by the ""woke"" mob on college campuses, on television, in the big cities. Never fear, believing Christians, Donald Trump will keep you safe.
> 
> The problem with this message — other than the fact that it comes from the devil — is that there was no promise of safety for those who chose to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. Indeed, it is the follower who risks their own safety by choosing to love their enemies, heal the sick, serve the poor and love those who are cast out, imprisoned or powerless. That is hard to do under any circumstances, but especially for someone who is sitting at home on their couch and is only interested in the rights of people who agree with them and think as they do.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

I used to be quiet when people would rant about the latest thing they’re angry about but not any more.

I used to be a devout member of the church. But no matter what we claim about our faith in Jesus, there’s often more value placed on acquiring material wealth. In my view, the church operates much like a multi-level marketing scheme. Trump resonates with church leaders because he’s a master marketer at a national scale, just as many pastors are at a local level. He sells his followers a distorted faith where they are the chosen people, and he is their messiah. He exploits insecurities around sexual freedom, a sensitive area in churches where repression and, too often, abuse are tolerated. Allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump mean little to his supporters, as many church leaders are guilty of similar offenses. At its core, the church seems driven by power—specifically, power for men, mostly white, but some Black and Hispanic as well. We often label evangelicals as if it implies ethical or moral superiority, but I believe it’s a facade. The term has come to signify a loyalty to certain cultural and political ideals rather than a commitment to true Christian values like compassion, humility, and justice. Instead, what’s often upheld is a selective morality that serves to maintain control and reinforce existing power structures. This pursuit of power, cloaked in the language of faith, ultimately compromises the very principles the church claims to stand for.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"> Moore told NPR in an interview released Tuesday that multiple pastors had told him they would quote the Sermon on the Mount, specifically the part that says to “turn the other cheek,” when preaching. Someone would come up after the service and ask, “Where did you get those liberal talking points?”


> “What was alarming to me is that in most of these scenarios, when the pastor would say, ‘I’m literally quoting Jesus Christ,’ the response would not be, ‘I apologize.’ The response would be, ‘Yes, but that doesn’t work anymore. That’s weak,’” Moore said. “When we get to the point where the teachings of Jesus himself are seen as subversive to us, then we’re in a crisis.”

"Reminder: The Evangelical movement didn't start getting shitty with Trump, they were looking for someone like Trump to lead them. Modern American Christianity is entirely a product of the Reagan era and a response to Jimmy Carter's presidency and a more left leaning SCOTUS ruling against racism.

Look at some of their most popular thought leaders: Dr. James Dobson, Kenneth Copeland, Pat Robertson, Paula White, The Falwells, Franklin Graham (less his father Billy, who was actually anti-racist most of the time).

[Then read up on the history of the Religious Right/Moral Majority](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133/) and realize that it was a movement that started in preparation for the 1980 election, including their modern views on abortion, and you'll understand what's going on much more directly.

Regardless of whether or not God exists, the evangelical movement doesn't exist to serve any deity, it exists to serve the GOP. I actually believe that Christianity would be far, far less common in America without the religious right's rise in the late 1970s. This is not an attack on your own belief in Christ or the bible. This is not me saying Christianity itself is false. You can sincerely have them without following the GOP. But we need to recognize that the culture that has permeated throughout the modern churches since the late 1970s is not actually about faith for its own sake or a religious movement for its own sake, it's entirely a political movement using religion as a propaganda tool.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Trump made this offer, and they took it eagerly.

“Christianity will have power,” he said. “If I’m there, you’re going to have plenty of power, you don’t need anybody else. You’re going to have somebody representing you very, very well. Remember that.”

As a Christian, it is chilling. It shows that these ""pastors"" who have taken his side have no spiritual discernment. That is, they are not guided by the indwelling Holy Spirit, nor do they even have enough awareness to recognize an obvious parallel of wording.

Trump's offer is so close to Satan's as to be a deliberate mockery. When I read it in the Times article, it was almost like a physical blow, and the writer didn't even draw the parallel himself.

"Yesterday, an [article introduced newly released audio recordings](https://www.thedailybeast.com/listen-to-the-jeffrey-epstein-tapes-i-was-donald-trumps-closest-friend/) of Jeffrey Epstein.  It's a snip from 100 hrs of recorded interviews in 2017 by a book author, while Trump was president, 2 years before Epstein died.

In the audio- which has captions since some audio is faint- he talks about Trump a lot.  He said he was Trumps closest friend for many years.  He talks about the good and bad:   Trump knew real estate extraordinarily well and was an incredible salesman; he liked what Trump was doing for policy 

To contrast with the life of Jesus:

- Epstein said any “act of kindness” would have been an accident.  

- this echos what [Trump's nephew Fred said, when DT told him to let his severely disabled son die](https://youtu.be/iRoEpxA5G9Q?si=NezVrMZ3PlPz87oM);  

- similar to what his Chief of Staff, [General John Kelly said](https://news.yahoo.com/news/john-kelly-says-trump-praised-152833585.html) said- that Trump lacked empathy, based on the disparaging remarks he made multiple times, confirmed by other staff.  


From the Epstein tapes article:  
- he described how he would seduce his friends wives by offering to setup a sexual situation with his friend and a hot young female contestant, but do this while the wife was listening on the phone-- to anger them and later seduce them.

- Epstein alleged, Trump took a woman to what he called “the Egyptian Room” in an Atlantic City casino. Epstein alleged, “He came out afterward and said, ‘It was great, it was great. The only thing I really like to do is f--- the wives of my best friends. That is just the best.’”

Having to deal with a single toxic prominent public figure instinctively lying dozens of times a day, sometimes an hour, and a contingent of ravenous followers who echo and invent their own convenient lies has messed me up so badly. The only thing I am grateful for is that I have infinite examples of what to show my child \*not\* to do if he wants to be a good person.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

">I'm particularly fascinated by the post Civil/Voting rights period of the 1960s which saw large numbers of white conservatives switching political parties. A period Republicans tend to pretend doesn't exist, didn't happen, nope, nuh-uh.

There is no pretending, simply there wasn't some large shift exclusive to the 1960s, simply the continuation of previous trends due to the economic development of the South.

In 1952, Eisenhower already won 48% of the Southern vote (opponent 52%), in 1956 he won 50% (opponent 49%), and in 1960, a close election Nixon won 46% (JFK 50.5%), even though he was representing the administration that pushed through 2 civil rights acts and pushed Brown at gunpoint.

> RALEIGH, N.C. - North Carolina had already surpassed its early-voting record set in 2020, but the State Board of Elections announced Sunday that more than 4.2 million voters cast ballots at early in-person voting sites, with turnout in western counties hit by Hurricane Helene outpacing the rest of the state.

> People can simultaneously register to vote and cast ballots at early voting sites.

> Including absentee voting, 4,465,548 voters - or 57% of the state&#039;s 7.8 million registered voters - cast ballots in the general election as of Sunday morning, officials said, noting that turnout may be slightly higher because of a lag between when ballots are cast and when data is uploaded.

"To add context to the numbers which are great, 5,443,067 total ballots were cast in 2020. We are already at ~78% of the 2020 turnout in a state still recovering from a devastating hurricane, purely in early vote. Turnout in this election is going to be crazy, and can very easily overwhelm all the 50/50 polling. 

This is especially relevant in this case when you consider that polling methodologies have no way to account for enthusiasm especially with young voters who are far less likely to respond to polling. They do not have landlines. They do not answer calls from numbers they don't recognize. They're not clicking on links in texts from random numbers. And I think that goes further than the voters we would typically think of as 'young.' I'm 37. I'm not answering that call. I don't have a landline. I'm not clicking that link. I think we are running up on an era where polling just cannot be meaningfully reliable anymore. Too many people are not reachable by the methods used.

I also think we may have an inverse problem to 2016. Trump's support was under-represented, speculatively because people were ashamed to say they were voting for him. In 2024 the cult is in full swing, and they see participation as validation of their 'movement' because of all the messaging of things being rigged against them. I think your average Trump 'base' supporter is far more likely to respond to polling than your typical democrat, precisely because of the extent to which their devotion to Trump has become the largest part of their personality.

I am cautiously very optimistic.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"> I am nervous and just want Tuesday to get here. 

Sadly it's going to be a long few weeks even after Tuesday, really no matter what.

- If there's a blue wave and Kamala crushes expectations, MAGA will cry foul because of the deviation from pre-election polls. They will use that deviation to justify extreme measures to overturn the result via the courts, by manipulating the certification process at the state level or in Congress, or simply with raw force.
- If it's close, MAGA will engage in whatever lawfare tactics they can to prevent counting of Democratic votes. There will be so much fuckery that we need to be on guard for, and we won't have a completely clear answer about the election results until January 21 when Biden's successor is sworn in.
- If it's a red wave and Trump crushes expectations, we will have to deal with the horrible consequences for four years instead of just a few weeks.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Yeah I've seen data that shows that in some states (I think I saw specifically in PA) that the increase in early voting overall shows that more republicans are converting from election day voters to early voters than we're seeing with democrats. Which I suppose means that a lot of those democrats voting early are net-new voters. Or that some republicans are staying home, and simply more of them are voting early this time. So already the numbers look good in early voting for Kamala, and there's a real risk that the election day vote is a disappointment for republicans.

Of course this all depends on democrats actually showing up for the election day vote, but I think there are reasons to be optimistic. And agree she has run an absolutely fantastic campaign. 

The gender gap in early voting to me is probably the most encouraging part. Women are MOTIVATED. And it makes sense. Sexual predator who overturned Roe and lied about it being what everyone wanted, vs the first ever female president? It's compelling.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

They also do online panels that recruit people to participate with ads, which I'd say also young people are going to be less likely to answer to. Physical mail which young people are going to be less likely to answer to, in some cases they'll even physically visit houses, etc.

It's an industry that's really struggling to figure out how to get people to respond in order to get good data. And I do not think they have it figured out. If you're modeling the answers you get to demographic and historical turnout data, it's really hard to anticipate what's going to happen in an election where we're consistently seeing record turnout in early voting.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Fortunately Kamala's campaign hasn't been making those mistakes. She's focused in the right places and has been running the whole time like she's behind.

"I was talking specifically about 2016 as contrasted with today, when his followers weren't fully indoctrinated yet. In many cases they were (in my opinion anyway) afraid to openly express their support for him at that point in time.

I agree 2020 was likely his high mark. And polling for his support was better then than in 2016. I think his base is potentially smaller now, but just as eager to be counted. But agree logic would dictate that the same tired candidate running on the same tired issues, but now with the dual albatrosses of Roe and Jan 6th around his neck should do worse.

"I think a very, very large portion of the voting public has PTSD from 2016.

If it helps, I've been predicting a landslide since the moment Trump declared his candidacy.  Right up to the moment Biden dropped out of the race.  And the moment after he did, up to this day.  Not because of Harris.

Because of January 6th.  I think January 6th was eye opening even for Republicans.  I think Roe V. Wade has been a slow burn that will add a lot of fuel to the fire, but I think January 6th and everything leading up to it was really a profound mask off moment that is not being given nearly enough credit.

Without it, I think it might be reasonable to think that Trump would see a similar increase in numbers like he saw in 2020 from 2016.  But after J6 and ""Stop the Steal,"" I do think it's very reasonable to think his support will drop from 2020.  I will be very surprised if Trump comes out of this with more votes than he did in 2020, and I will not be surprised at all if he fails to meet his 2016 numbers.

I think this is not just prior Trump voters staying home or voting for RFK - it's also a prior Trump voters *flipping against him*.  Some portion of those who even voted for him in 2020.  Maybe not many, but every single one of them increases the gap by 2 votes in Harris' favor.

How many of those do you think Trump is going to get?  My guess is near 0 - basically just the mental breakdown / midlife crisis cohort.

How many people who voted against Trump in 2020 do you think will fail to show up to vote against him in 2024?  My guess here is also near 0.  Even if you phrase it in terms of how many people who voted for Biden do you think will stay home when it comes to Harris?  I think Harris is actually the much stronger candidate in many respects.  Why would we turn out for the mediocre candidate and not the much more competent candidate, given the same opponent who is now 4 years older?

Remember, in race 1, we both get 1 vote, and the gap is +0.  In race 2, if your 1 vote flips to me, the gap becomes +2.  Depending on this particular population, we really could enter landslide territory.  I DO think this population exists.  I think some portion of them voted for him in 2016 but didn't vote for Biden in 2020 and now will vote for Harris in 2024.  And others who voted for Trump in 2020 and will flip to Harris in 2024.

But even without any Trump supporters flipping, the fact that Trump tried to throw away the record-breaking majority of voters who turned out against him in 2020 is about to bite him in the ass, *very hard*.  This isn't 2016.  Back then, we largely didn't grasp the damage the carnival clown show could do, or the sheer incompetency and stupidity we'd be subjected to.  Some of us, of course, saw it the moment the clowns started their advertising campaign, but not nearly enough of us.

We showed up in 2020 because we wanted the clown show to end, not because we were particularly supportive of Biden.  That same motivation is still driving things, your PTSD is a testament to that fact.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"> How many people who voted against Trump in 2020 do you think will fail to show up to vote against him in 2024? My guess here is also near 0.

Anecdotally, I know one person who says he voted Democrat in 2016 and 2020, but will not be this time.

"Agree. Well said. Plus she isn't running with Jan 6th and overturning Roe hanging around her neck. In any sane world there's a price to pay for each of those things. And I think the gender split we're seeing in early voting points to that being true at least for abortion. I would struggle to think of a scenario that would motivate women to vote more than having one candidate be the sex predator who took away their reproductive freedom and lied to them that it's what 'everyone' wanted, while the other would be the first female president.

I'm choosing to think of the negativity of the polls as probably a net positive in the end. Kamala has run a great campaign running like she's behind. No Democrat is staying home because they think this thing is already won. And turnout so far would seem to support that. We're breaking records in early voting in every swing state. People are voting. And it says a lot about American politics that high turnout is specifically only good for one of our political parties.

> The Democrats and White House hopeful Kamala Harris got a boost in Nevada from two-time Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence, who landed in Las Vegas on Friday for a day of campaign activities that included door-knocking outreach and meetings with local officials.

> Per intel confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter, Lawrence&#039;s itinerary kicked off with a canvass launch at the campaign field office, where she met up with Nevada Democratic regional organizing director Craig Bakerjian and a group of volunteers.

> Lawrence sat for what is described as an intimate roundtable of seven guests, including first-time voters, small business owners and local activists.

If you live in a state that is solidly red or blue then door knocking in your own state won't do much. Don't go disparaging someone's efforts because they may not be able to afford to travel to a swing state and knock on doors. ,2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Let's not discredit the merits and hard work that goes into handwriting all those postcards to swing states. Handwriting 500 postcards by yourself is no easy feat; I wrote 200 of them and my hand was cramping like crazy. I can't imagine doing 500. All that handwriting takes a lot of time too. Hours. Also, you have to buy your own postcard stamps, and that costs 50 cents a pop ($250 to mail 500 postcards). So there is physical, temporal, and financial effort put forth. Add in the creation of a personalized message, and you also have empathy and emotional effort put forth.


You don't need to walk door to door to make an impact. And besides, something done is better than nothing done.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"First off, I’d love to see LBJ alive and kicking, he did a helava lot to advance civil rights.  And he had character:

Secondly, Republicans voting for Harris is definitely a thing this cycle,… taking away a woman’s right to choose, and January 6th, override party loyalty.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
What? Tons of Republicans will be voting blue this year.,2024_11_04,06_23_09

Nice knockers?,2024_11_04,06_23_09
Did you vote?,2024_11_04,06_23_09

"You’re preaching to the choir, I’d vote for him.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"LBJ and Biden are as close as we've come to our greatest hit, FDR. And if we go by the Republican obsession with his sons dong, by the transitory properties of Dong science, they both were well hung presidential heros. In opposition to our worst t8ny shroom president.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
I voted for Kamala but that seems cope. Trying to swing republicans and appease them seems like the same failing tactic we always use.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
Sadly that can cut both ways. I’m sure there are MAGAs who register as dem to steer the candidate.,2024_11_04,06_23_09

That's fair. I think both are wrong in this scenario though. ,2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Trump never did concede the 2020 election, the only major party presidential candidate in American history to refuse to concede an electoral loss. The narcissism and delusion are embedded as deep as his hate, greed, and vanity. They are who he is.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

">Mr. Trump, while riffing, also pointed to the protective glass encasing him now at outdoor rallies since he survived the assassination attempt in Butler. “To get to me, somebody would have to shoot through fake news, and I don’t mind that much, ’cause, I don’t mind. I don’t mind,” he said, as some in the crowd laughed and howled.

"I didn't write this-- I found it on reddit. And obviously it was written pre-covid. But it's a solid narrative. Enjoy.  
\---  
""I really really hope this all ends with him arranging a summit with Putin in Moscow as a ruse for him to defect. That way it will be really hard for anyone to not reconcile with the fact that he is a self-interested coward.  
Imagine Trump in Russia. For the first couple of months it’s the biggest story in the world. He does interviews on Russian State TV, talking about how the Deep State caused him to flee the Country. Insisting he's still the President.  
But then, slowly but as sure as the changing tide, fewer journalists are calling. Fewer requests for an interview. For a couple months he can still call up reporters and have what he says to them be newsworthy. But eventually they stop returning his calls. America and the world has moved on. He was a blip, a flash in the pan. He exposed deep wounds that the American people need to address. But he was a complication, not the original infection.  
No one really wants to know what he has to say anymore. Because no one cares.  
He's now truly alone. In reality he has always been alone. He just hadn't realized it. Now he has regular contact with no one but his FSB bodyguards/handlers. He's stuck in a golden prison of his own making. He lives next to Yanukovych. But Viktor, being Ukrainian knows the culture and the language. Trump is never able to master anything but the ability to mumble some words that border on the incomprehensible in the language.  
His days are spent in a unexceptional (in his eyes), dacha on the black sea. He's never far from the ever present sight of Russian Security Services. He lives off a modest Kremlin funded stipend. But domestic pressure is building on the United Russia Party to scale it back. He has no income of his own anymore. His assets are frozen and seized around the World.  
His children are indicted. He didn't tell them of his plans to flee beforehand and they were as surprised as anyone. But, perhaps for the first time in their lives, Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric feel the curious absence of a pressure they can't explain. At first they can't figure it out. They each face years in prison yet they have never felt more free. They confide in each other and they soon realize that the weight lifted from their souls is that of their father.  
Free from his domineering presence they all plea to lesser charges. Putting the blame squarely on the narcissistic father whose ""Stockholm Syndrome"" like grip on them is slipping. They are sentenced. Don Jr. gets 18 months in Federal Prison. Ivanka and Jared are sentenced to staggered 12 month sentences. Eric cooperates fully and is not charged.  
They are forbidden from contacting their father as part of their plea agreements. But they have no such desires. They don't care.  
Melania files for divorce almost immediately after his flight. She gains full custody of Barron in uncontested hearings. Her and her son are slowly spending more and more time in Slovenia. Eventually they relocate permanently. Melania and Barron split their time between Ljubljana and the French Riviera. Very sparingly visiting the States anymore. Her autobiography detailing the mental, emotional, and at times physical abuse she suffered becomes an international best seller. Trump's American passport has long since been revoked and the Slovene Government, as well as the EU, bans him from entry into the Schengen Area. He never sees, much less talks to them, again  
Trump becomes increasingly paranoid. He frequently tears his dacha apart looking for listening devices planted by Mossad, the Democrats, CIA, MI6 or whatever globalist conspiracy is hunting him this week. Soon he has no use for the teenage sex workers he has always fancied. Never having been a drinker, food becomes his only vice. He begins to put on weight. A lot of weight. As he slips into morbid obesity he nears 355 pounds.  
He very often rants and raves at his bodyguards. His tenuous grip on reality is slipping. Some days he doesn't seem to know where he is. He is borderline catatonic on occasion. Spending days in his bedroom suite without leaving, only to eventually emerge in a fresh, albeit cheap and ill-fitting, suit. His wispy hair, long kept alive by the marvels of modern hair care technology, perfectly coiffed. During these fleeting moments of seeming sanity, he doesn't seem to remember much of the last decades. Believing himself to still be a pompous fixture of the New York real estate scene. He once even asked his handlers how the New Jersey Generals were fairing this season.  
But within two or three days he is once again disheveled and ranting about the Deep State. His speech becoming more slurred and incomprehensible by the year. A series of strokes leaves his body partially paralyzed on one side. He now requires round the clock nursing. Incontinence soon follows.  
Eventually he's found on the floor of his dacha, face down in a puddle of his own vomit. He is discovered by the morning nurse as she begins her shift. His breathing is slow, his heart rate is faint. He never again regains consciousness. He looks to have collapsed at some point in the night. During a mad, partially paralyzed slog to the bathroom in a vain attempt to avoid soiling his bed once again.  
The official cause of death is a heart attack. Which is likely true but having outlived his usefulness, the Russian government has long since seen him as an embarrassing liability. His asylum has been a sticking point in relations with the West for years and conspiracy theories alleging his assassination at the hands of the FSB or CIA abound.  
The Russians offer to repatriate his remains. Although his family, while not outright refusing, is lukewarm to the prospect. They have moved on. Barron and Tiffany don't even use his surname anymore. Unable to find a solution, the Russians bury him in a modest grave. It was originally planned to be temporary but a long term solution never comes to fruition. Before too long everyone has forgotten.  
In death he remains infamous. His name uttered in the same breath as other embarrassing episodes of American History. Although more as the butt of ridicule and scorn. After all, it's not like he was even competent enough get the country into a real disaster such as Vietnam or the Iraq War.  
In US History textbooks he is relegated to a few paragraphs. Not more than half a page. He's brought up in conjunction with a wider discussion on the Political gridlock of the late 2000s, 2010s and early 20s. In the end, he is nothing more than the answer to a few multiple choice questions on an 11th Grade History Final. His legacy once seemed destined to be that of a pompous, arrogant game show host and real estate fraudster. Nothing but a textbook example of that which one would describe as ""tacky"".  
Now he is simply: ""What was the name of the President who's often xenophobic campaign and subsequent election highlighted the deep political divisions of the late 2010s?""  
The answer is '(C) Donald J. Trump' """,2024_11_04,06_23_09

So no, I have no faith in certain government institutions and agencies.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
I think it was more to do with the fact the secret service would escort him out. It was on the news for days that Trump was planning to stay but that there would be consequences. It became more and more of a talking point before he finally said in an interview something like “of course I will leave”,2024_11_04,06_23_09

"That precedent is flawed, though.

A) I've written about this elsewhere in the last month or so, but I can't find the comment now. In any event, the very short version of it was that while the *enlisted* might lean right, and have quite a few hard-righters in the ranks, the *officers* are more specifically educated in military history and military law as it relates to their duties and responsibility to the US Constitution. 

I got to pick the brains of quite a few mid-level officers who are, by now, among the very senior of the operational-level officers and lower-level Admirals. Almost universally, the takeaway I got was that the officers decidedly did *not* approve and appreciate Trump, at least in relation to his activities around the military. So many of his policies were slow-rolled to death, waiting out his vacating the office of the Presidency.

B) The Civil War was very much a war of geographical concerns - North vs South. It's much more muddled now - with the exception of the National Guard, there aren't units made up entirely of Minnesotans or Kansans. Soldiers from California fight and train side-by-side with soldiers from North Dakota. And since the services shuttle people all over the place, all the time, there is no real ability to build up any kind of certainty of building up a critical mass of like-minded people.

C) In the same vein as B above, the infrastructure and tools required are *extremely* different between the Civil War and now. Not just in the actual equipment, but also the scale of logistics. In theory, you *could* have a unit break away - and within just a few weeks their equipment will have broken down and be nearly worthless because where are they getting their replacement parts from? Where are they getting their fuel from?

In the Civil War, arms were quite regularly provided by the soldiers themselves - at least the basics, and especially for the separatists. Horses were plentiful, and grass was everywhere to feed them - and they could always purchase food from a sympathetic farmer. Cannon and shot were a big deal, of course, but war could still be fought without it.

I've worked on equipment that needed replacement parts *every day* - and good luck getting those parts of the DOD calls up the one government contractor that supplies the parts and says, ""Shut it the *fuck* down, right now, to <*insert breakaway unit here*>."" 

Bottom line - there's too many reasons for the military to stay the fuck out of this, and possibly even work *against* Trump. There's almost no real way for more than a handful of dissidents to break away from the military, and they're certainly not going to have the equivalent of the South's General Staff to help legitimize the effort.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Okay, but there are other problems. The ballot was designed in a way that was confusing and caused people to vote for third parties, affecting mostly people voting for Al Gore. Those votes (wayyyy over the number, in the tens of thousands iirc) couldn’t be contested, because it is impossible to tell the true intent of the voter. But it was almost certainly deliberate, because Bush voters, voting on the same ballot, did not have that issue in such big margins that it was countable.

Then, Jeb and the person who certifies the election (can’t remember her name, but she was on the Bush campaign) slowed the process by falsely certifying and telling people to stop counting. Then, the Supreme Court decision came down with two decisions. One was non-partisan and ruled that Bush’s due process was violated (which is true, but so was Al Gore’s? And frankly more demonstrably in the aftermath? But whatever) and then the partisan decision about when the count should stop.

Did George Bush know about these shenanigans? There’s no proof. But I have zero doubt Jeb Bush and the Florida republicans did this on accident. Genuinely, Florida’s election was stolen in 2000.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Another guy walked into a place with a MAGA hat on and punched an elderly election worker in the face several times for giving him shit about wearing candidate paraphernalia, despite the fact that any Laal supporter would be approached for the same.

Ignorance is a blight on our society. Whether it's civil and political ignorance, bigotry, gut feeling in the face of observable empirical evidence...

It is so unfortunate that we no longer value the liberal and general education, and many disdain those who seek it. We spurn history as an irrelevance, we welcome cheap entertainment as a substitute for thinking.

All of the above makes me an elitist liberal prick. Read Breitbart and listen to your Pastor and you know all you need to know... Switch off brain and vote for Donald. It'll probably be OK...

8 September 1974, when Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"I believe the reasons why “moral character” stopped being a deciding factor for leadership and the presidency are twofold:

Evangelicals:  

We have a few things to thank for Trump’s rise in the Evangelical community, who were not supportive of Trump until Jerry Falwell, Jr. came out with a strong endorsement. Of course, later we learned the truth. Jerry Falwell, Jr., the former Evangelical Liberty University President, accepted an offer from Michael Cohen and Donald Trump to bury his threesome sex scandal between himself, his wife, and the 20 year old poolboy, in exchange for Falwell promoting Trump with Evangelicals to help him win the election. You cannot make this up.

Evangelicals also threw their values under the bus in exchange for conservative Supreme Court justices and the chance to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Fast-forward to today, and women are suffering severe medical complications and dying as a direct consequence of Trump being elected.  Evangelicals are going to need to answer for Trump’s presidency someday.  

Billionaires: 

Then you have billionaires. We saw the likes of Jeff Bezos fold like a cheap suit when he told Washington Post not to endorse Harris. Then there’s Elon Musk spending millions of dollars to help elect Trump, no doubt because he thinks it will be financially advantageous. But these billionaires are making a Faustian bargain.  Trump’s loyalty is a one-way street. For CEOs of corporations, who care only about profits, morals are not in the equation. They want more tax cuts and Trump has promised more tax cuts and more money in their pockets, shifting more wealth to the top and increasing inequality. 

There is a direct line between massive inequality and the rise of far right populism. Politicians are great at distractions, pointing the finger at immigrants, instead of addressing the real issues at hand. Of course, the extreme example of that is the economic and political instability in the late 1920s and early 1930s that played a role in helping the Nazis rise to power.

Just as Trump’s attempt to stop the peaceful transition of power on January 6, the Nazis had a failed coup d'état in 1923.  They were not held accountable, and in 1933, Hitler came into power.

Similar to Project 2025, the Nazi’s Enabling Act of 1933 allowed the Chancellor, Adolf Hitler, to bypass the system of checks and balances in the government. As John Oliver explained in a segment on Project 2025, their plan for the separation of powers is a game of rock, paper, scissors, except rock crushes paper and scissors every single time.

Just as Trump has promised to go after political enemies, Hitler and the Nazis declared a state of emergency through the Reichstag Fire Decree and began a violent crackdown against political enemies.

For those who think a right wing extremist movement cannot happen in America, one only need to watch video of the January 6 attack and the documentary, A Night at the Garden, to know that it can. Watching Trump speak at Madison Square Garden, with the vile, hateful comments he made, was surreal in light of this history and his escalating violent rhetoric. Vote for a positive path going forward.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"I think this comes from facts not mattering, because every side now has their own ""facts"" which are propagated and supported by their own ""institutions"" (e.g. CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, News Max).

Because moral quality does matter. Most of Trump's followers aren't holding their noses voting for the man -- they're completely dedicated to him and think Biden/Harris as corrupt, weak, evil. In fact, it's quintessentially framed as a battle of good vs. evil on both sides.

The inability to really digest Trump as a convicted felon and rapist, for hiding classified documents in his Maralago resort, for supporting dictators, for mocking disabled persons and fallen soldiers.. all of this stem from the growth and presence of institutions that offer alternative facts. 

And most of it can be traced to various legal rulings that allowed Fox News to propagate alternative facts under the guise of ""entertainment"", and then today the various alt right far right children it has spawned.

It's a post-truth society now. 

In the USA, where many key events are essentially popularity contests i.e. elections, this can work.

"I’m by no means a Nixon apologist or a G*P sympathizer, but I disagree. 

I believe that Ford was dealt a bad hand and played it the best he could. The scandal was more or less politically ‘settled’ after Nixon willingly fucked off to avoid a senate conviction. The country needed to move on, and a proper trial that would drag on for years was not the ideal course of events, considering the turbulent time that was the mid to late 70s.  

Ford inherited an administration plagued by Watergate, the inglorious end to the war in Vietnam, the worst recession since the Great Depression, and the worst inflation in U.S. history. 

In his efforts to deal with inflation, unemployment, and the energy crisis, he had switched policies several times. As a result, Republican liberals felt he was too conservative, and conservatives felt he was too liberal. He was the nominee of a party that could claim the loyalty of only about 20 percent of the electorate, and he had no regional base of support. 

He was in a prime position for the Democratic party to run circles around him. It was Carter who had implemented a “southern strategy” in ‘76, though I say this without the racist connotations of the term. The man just recognized that the south was up for grabs, and begging for a clean swipe. When the returns were in, it was clear that Carter’s strategy had paid off. The Solid South except Virginia had returned to the Dems for the first time since 1960. 

Anyhow, though Ford would be taunted across the aisle for his dodgy pardon of Nixon, I believe that he indeed had, as he claimed, restored a measure of “trust and confidence” in the White House.

even just broadly, politics is about  building coalitions.  you want to win elections talking about a couple hundred million people as if they move in mass together for the same reasons is not only explicitly bigoted, it’s counterproductive.   the goal is not to make sure everybody knows exactly why you are not christian.  the goal is to get Mormon women to give the final push over the finish line in Arizona and Nevada.  

again, for the record.  

persuasion, not evangelism. genuinely no one cares why you’re non religious.  absorb that please.  they don’t care any more  than you care why they are religious.  coalition building is the goal.  interfaith dialogue is the goal.  organize, don’t divide.  to persuade  you need to learn how to explain your argument in a way that appeals to other people, not to attack their identity.   progressives are genuinely very stupid sometimes. ",2024_11_04,06_23_09

">As far as abortion, I think is a losing issue that puts Pregnant women’s lives at risk since the legality doesn’t support those who have life threatening pregnancies.

It also helps that the bible does not even indirectly forbid abortion, and instead seems to lean on the side of supporting it by inference. The irony for me is that Christians have hitched their entire moral system to a thing that the bible does not forbid, and then subordinated all the things the Bible *does* command or forbid to their imaginary rule.

It is, without a doubt, a heresy under the orthodox understanding of scripture.

Seriously, one can spend weeks trying to tease out some sort of anti-abortion interpretation of scripture that largely requires you to ignore certain scriptures and then take other ones completely out of *both* their cultural and literary context, and ultimately fail to come up with anything compelling. But if you spend two seconds trying to figure out how you should treat immigrants, the result is clear and exeedingly obvious. And yet Christians go the *exact* opposite way with immigrants, valuing our money over their lives. (Ironically their policies would actually make us have less money, not more, but that is a different point.)

It is stuff like this that drove me from the Church. I went to bible college to try and understand the bible better, and the result was a complete loss of faith in the church.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

This is one reason that a lot of political shows in the US had the point - counterpoint format with one host being a democrat and the other being republican. It was an easy way to fulfill that requirement. In a fairness doctrine universe, you would see more democrats on Fox News, but it wouldn't really stop people from being dishonest. One of the main complaints democrats make against the media is the tendency to 'both sides' and present them as equally valid.

"Fluoride in drinking water is considered important because it helps prevent tooth decay, especially in children. When fluoride is added to water, it strengthens tooth enamel, making teeth more resistant to cavities. This process, known as fluoridation, has been studied for over 70 years and is supported by organizations like the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Both report that communities with fluoridated water have seen a significant drop in dental cavities, which can lead to fewer dental problems and costs over a lifetime.

Here are some well-researched articles and studies that support the continued use of fluoride in drinking water:

	1.	“Water Fluoridation and Dental Caries in U.S. Children and Adolescents”
	•	Published in the Journal of Dental Research, this study shows a clear link between fluoridated water and reduced cavities in children.
	
	2.	“Community Water Fluoridation: A Review of Its Health Effects and Risks”
	•	This review published in the Public Health Reports discusses the benefits of fluoridation, including fewer cavities and improved oral health, while outlining the safe levels set by health organizations.

	3.	“Economic Evaluation of Community Water Fluoridation: A Community Guide Systematic Review”
	•	Published by the CDC, this systematic review shows that fluoridation is cost-effective for preventing cavities, making it beneficial for communities with limited access to dental care.
	

The Opposing View

Some research suggests that fluoride might have negative effects if consumed in very high levels, though these levels are much higher than those in community water systems. Critics argue that fluoride could potentially cause health issues, such as dental fluorosis (a cosmetic issue causing white spots on teeth), and raise concerns about possible effects on the brain.

	1.	“Developmental Fluoride Neurotoxicity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis”
	•	This study published in Environmental Health Perspectives reviewed the impact of fluoride on children’s IQ in areas with high fluoride levels (often above recommended levels). It’s important to note that these levels are typically much higher than what’s found in U.S. water systems.
	
	2.	“Fluoride Exposure and Kidney and Liver Function among Adolescents in the United States”
	•	Published in Environment International, this study examined fluoride exposure and its potential effects on kidney and liver health. Again, the findings are relevant primarily in cases of high fluoride levels, not those commonly found in regulated water supplies.
	

Overall, the general consensus among public health organizations is that fluoride in water at regulated levels is safe and beneficial for dental health, while higher-than-recommended levels may pose risks.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

There are research studies which show that counties which put more fluoride in their water on average have lower IQs, which is true. For some people that's all they needed to hear; they assume that the IQs are lower because of the higher levels of fluoride. 

What they don't consider is WHY those higher levels of fluoride were instituted in the first place. Areas with a lower standard of education have fewer people going to medical school, so they have fewer dentists. As a stopgap against widespread tooth decay, they increased the amount of fluoride in the water.

"This is a tricky one because fluoridated water/ingestion is one of the least studied public health policies out there. The more studies come out, the more apparent it is that higher than *average* consumption is likely quite bad, and that we need to study in depth both higher consumption levels but also normal consumption levels. Fluoride definitely acts topically, and there are plenty of studies showing that fluoridated toothpaste works great. **The idea that fluoride might work systemically without significant side effects is scientific conjecture - it simply hasn't been studied in that regard.** And recent studies point to the need to study exactly that.

So an administration that makes health policy based on science would push for this to be studied in depth, which should have been in the works for decades. It's a real problem for a crazy person to say this because a lot of people will have the knee-jerk reaction that they are absolutely wrong. But in this case, scientifically, that can't be determined either way, though evidence shows a real need to study this in more depth because we currently don't know. 

As for my family, we'll continue *not* drinking fluoridated water and continue brushing with fluoridated toothpaste, and ignore any health advice coming from political nutjobs. Our kids have zero cavities/fillings by the way. 

There's also the sad fact that 25% of US kids literally don't drink any plain water during an average day, so even if it turns out to be systemically effective without side effects, it's lost on a lot of people.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Not a dentist, but I have several friends who are doctors, pharmacologists, and biochemists. 


The answer largely boils down to how the fluoridation helps fight tooth decay. It’s not doing so by direct surface application when it’s taken into the body, it’s done by absorption of fluoride into the body, which is then released in the form  of fluoride ions in the saliva over the course of time. To have the same effect, you have to be pretty much constantly using mouthwash and brushing your teeth a dozen or more times over the course of the day, or be swallowing mouthwash and toothpaste at a pretty good clip. 


If *all* you’re drinking is unadulterated spring water, then yeah, toothpaste and mouthwash will help, but remember that pretty much all fountain beverages are made with tap, same with brewed coffee and tea, and the water for soups, and everything else, is almost certainly using tap water, which is fluoridated. 


Putting fluoride in toothpaste and mouthwash helps, but not significantly compared to fluoridated water, it’s mostly a marketing gimmick by the manufacturers.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Fluoride in toothpaste is great but very young children can't use toothpaste with fluoride in it because the concentration is too high for ingestion. The recommended fluoride concentration in drinking water (also called the optimal level) is 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/index.html)) which is 0.0007%. Toothpaste generally has about 0.15% fluoride so that would be *significantly* (200+ times) higher. Young children swallow a lot of the toothpaste they use. This is why ""training toothpaste"" is a thing, it has no fluoride and lets kids practice brushing until they learn how to brush without swallowing the toothpaste.  

Putting fluoride in water in a safe to consume concentration allows these young children to get the benefits of fluoride without the risks of consuming too much. 

I think it's also worth noting that some water has naturally occurring fluoride and the guidelines on fluoridated water actually prompted communities to *reduce* the amount of fluoride in their water to match the recommended level.

If you're an adult who drinks bottled water but brushes with fluoride toothpaste twice a day, you're probably fine. Just make sure you do NOT rinse the toothpaste away. Spit but don't rinse. Let the fluoride do its job. :)",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Years ago a friend of mine went head-first into the shallow end of the conspiracy pool, and was always going on about Chemtrails. I have a pilot's license, and tried to explain to her what she was really seeing, but she never believed me. One night I went on a conspiracy chat on FB and pretended to be a Monsanto chemist working nights, and that I figured out what's in the Chemtrails. Everyone in the chat believed me. I then said you could get the Chemtrail chemicals off your lawn by spraying vinegar and water all over - a process us scientists call 'douching' - and that this will leave your grass as fresh as a summer's eve. Then, you have to water the grass for 1/2 hour - especially on hot days because heat makes it harder to remove the residue from the neutralized Chemtrails. No one got the joke, and it went viral. Even up until around a year ago YouTube was filled with videos of people spraying vinegar and water up at the sky. This is what we're dealing with in RFK Jr.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

A few minutes later a bunch of other security officers and 2 guys wearing protective suits and carrying Geiger Counters showed up. They scanned me for radiation, and when they got to my wrist with the watch the loud fast ticking from the Geiger Counter turned into a steady scream. Turns out my antique watch was massively radioactive.

“Jeannie Gaffigan is an actress, producer, writer, philanthropist, mother of five and all around comedic force. She is most well-known for the comedy empire she created with her writing, producing partner, and husband, Jim Gaffigan, and is a New York Times Bestseller for her book, When Life gives You Pears.

A lot has happened in my life as a Catholic mother over the past four years, the main event being that four of my five kids are now teenagers, which has me in crisis mode most of the time. As I struggle to keep my children from falling off the boat, I have managed to avoid navigating the turbulent waters of the political scene. But alas, time flies by, and here we are on the cusp of a presidential election.

When I pulled my head out of stalking my kids’ secret social media accounts, I could not suppress my shock and alarm about how little has changed in the world despite their evolving into highly intelligent life forms capable of outsmarting me. I wish my nature was as gentle as it used to be, but I’ve become hardened by the scrapes and bruises of traversing a teenage wasteland. In the past, I might have written this essay asking fellow faithful Catholics to examine their consciences and figure out how we can best align our voting choices with our values, but instead, I will say only this:

"Ending:

“As Election Day approaches, I call on my Catholic brothers and sisters to take a second look at what drives us to support Donald Trump. Do we genuinely believe that he leads in a way consistent with our most cherished principles? Or are we backing him out of fear? I have a hard time seeing how you can support a guy who is so evidently a bull in the china shop of democracy and who shows so little regard for so many lives—especially the most vulnerable, who we are called to see as God’s image and likeness. I just can’t see how following that path would lead to any good for democracy, for equality, for the church or for the lives we see as especially precious.

Let’s call for leaders who embody the principles of our faith. This faith calls us to care for the marginalized and to uphold the dignity of every person. It calls us to work for a future that is rooted in love and justice. It calls us to insist on leadership that aligns with the values we hold sacred. While we are going to continue to advocate for the dignity of the unborn, let’s admit Ms. Harris has Catholic cred on other important issues:

* Advocating for policies that support working families, a big deal in Catholic social teaching? Check. 
* Affordable health care? Check. 
* Family leave? Yes, please. 
* Her focus on environmental issues aligns nicely with Pope Francis’ call to care for our common home in “Laudato Si’.” 
* And on immigration, even though her primary campaign message on this has been cracking down on asylum claims, she’s been firm about providing humane policies and a pathway to citizenship, which the Catholic Church has long supported.”

"“The Edison exit polls estimate that 52% of all Catholic voters went for Biden this year, and 47% for Trump. The Edison exit polls in 2016 showed a 46% Catholic vote for Clinton, and 50% for Trump. … \[In\] 2004, when Kerry was the Catholic nominee for the Democratic Party, Catholics went for Bush (52%) over Kerry (47%). In 2008, when Obama defeated McCain by seven points overall, Obama won the Catholic vote 54% to 45%. And in 2012, Obama got 50% while Romney got 48%. … So it's certainly safe to conclude that Biden's Catholicism did not result in a startling or substantial uptick in support for the Democratic ticket among Biden's fellow Catholics compared with Democratic performance among Catholics in previous elections.“ [https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/324410/religious-group-voting-2020-election.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/324410/religious-group-voting-2020-election.aspx)",2024_11_04,06_23_09

1,437,304 democrats voted
1,478,761 Republicans
1,492,799 independents


If we assume all democrats voted for Harris, 10% of Republicans, and half of independents which should be accurate give or take just based off gender.


1,437,304 + 0.1(1,478,761) + 0.5(1,492,799) = 2,331,580 Harris votes


Taking out the Republicans and Independents remaining


2,331,580 - 0.9(1,478,761)-0.5(1,492,799) = 254,295 votes Harris is up by.


There's about 900,000 R voters left, 1,000,000 democrats voters, and 1.5 million independent.


Assuming 80% of the remaining voters vote that totals. 2,720,000 voters left.


He should need to get around [0.5(2,720,000) + 254,295]/2,720,000 = 59% of the remaining vote on election day. Not impossible but hard and why he's spending extra time here.

"Tbh at this point you'd have to consider him just... giving up the moment he loses in two days. There's this weird thing with old people at a certain point that they seem to be 90% powered by sheer willpower even if their body is one moment away from crumbling.

Now if he loses, he has NOTHING left. There's no more grifts, no more schemes, no more plans, all his ""friends"" will jump ship, it's just him and the public humiliation of having to go from one losing trial to the next. Wouldn't be surprised if the mental fallout from that just evaporates whatever is keeping this system running and he'll be dead by the end of the month.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

We already know he's going to declare victory either way, and we've already seen how eagerly his followers join him in saying so. I don't expect the GOP at large to dump him until they're sure the threat of him has passed.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

“I have a piece of glass over here,” Trump said during a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, pointing to his far right. Since the assassination attempt against Trump in July, both he and Vice President Kamala Harris have spoken behind panels of bulletproof glass as a safety measure.

Trump Says ‘I Don’t Mind’ if the Media Gets Shot
Peter Wade
November 3, 2024

At the beginning of his first rally on Sunday, said, “I love being off these stupid teleprompters because the truth comes out.” That statement was an omen of what was to come when if a would-be assassin had to “shoot through” members of the media in an attempt to kill him.

“I have a piece of glass over here,” Trump said during a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, pointing to his far right. Since the assassination attempt against Trump in July, both he and Vice President Kamala Harris have spoken behind panels of bulletproof glass as a safety measure.

“And I don’t have a piece of glass there,” Trump added, pointing between the panes of glass.

“I have this piece of glass here,” Trump continued, pointing forward. “But all we really have over here is the fake news, right?” The crowd laughed.

“And, to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind. I don’t mind that,” he said.


As , “The riser facing [Trump] head-on is full of reporters and cameras.”

The former president then breezed by essentially wishing death upon reporters and camera operators, likely including employees of outlets that are friendly to him, and started to talk about how the glass means he doesn’t “look great on television.”

“So I have a piece of glass,” he said, “and the problem with the glass is I don’t look great on television when you have a four-inch piece of glass that a Howitzer can’t go through. When you see yourself on television, you say… you’re really not very recognizable to be honest with you, which is good.” (Trump is, in fact, extremely recognizable, in part because of .)

Even though Trump quickly moved on from his dangerous remarks, it’s important to point out his threatening rhetoric for what it is: a call to violence.

The Trump campaign released a statement following the former president’s remarks, making a pathetic attempt at rewriting history: “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the Media constantly talks and jokes about,” Trump Communications Director Steven Cheung wrote. “The President’s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else. It was about threats against him that were spurred on by dangerous rhetoric from Democrats. In fact, President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also. There can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!”

During the rally, Trump also commented that he “shouldn’t have left office” after he lost the 2020 election. “It said we had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” he said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean, honestly.” He then continued, “We did so well, we had such a great—” but stopped short. He then said, “So now, every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there.”

As The New York Times pointed out (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/trump-pa-rally-election.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes), Trump repeatedly said at the end of his term that he was not going to leave. “I’m just not going to leave,” he told one aide. Another aide heard Trump say, “We’re never leaving… How can you leave when you won an election?”

"That’s kind of a complex issue and it varies from province to province. 

We’re in Ontario, we’ve had two conservative governments in the last two decades and it has utterly torn apart our healthcare system, something that we’ve taken a lot of pride in this Canadians. Wait times are longer at hospitals, it’s getting harder to find family doctors outside of Toronto. Schools are underfunded, yet by comparison to other places around the world, It’s not so bad. It’s just not what we had. 

Housing is ridiculously expensive pretty much across country right now, but I know that’s common. A lot of investment companies are buying single-family homes and renting them out at absorbent prices and the governments not doing anything to prevent this ; provincial, municipal, or federal. 

We’ve had issues with immigration, which has had an impact on housing and on the job market. Our wages aren’t keeping up with inflation at all. It’s just a bunch of little things that are going on, and it feels like the country is losing a bit of its soul.

But I have family in the US, I have family around the world, and I’m seeing this kind of thing everywhere. Canada is not unique in this situation. So obviously it could be better, but it could be a lot worse. I’d rather be here than anywhere else .",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"The microphone incident was a clear demonstration to me of Trump's filters failing him. This is the kind of raunchy locker room humor he's probably done all his life but now he can no longer tell that it's the wrong time and place for it. His dementia will progress rapidly. This is incredibly dangerous from a national security standpoint, especially since Republicans have proven over and over that they will never remove him from office under any circumstances. A dementia riddled Trump will get a lot of people killed when the next global emergency appears.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"TLDR:

* Donald Trump's nephew [Fred C. Trump III](https://people.com/fred-trump-iii-interview-son-william-disability-advocacy-8706139) is opening up about his family's often-overlooked history of dementia — and how his uncle's recent behavior reminds him of the other Trumps who have faced cognitive health challenges, including Donald's dad.
* ""Like anyone else, I've seen his decline. But I see it in parallel with the way my grandfather's decline was,"" [Fred, 61, tells PEOPLE](https://people.com/fred-trump-family-history-dementia-donald-behavior-exclusive-8738427) of Donald, 78, who has at times downplayed his father's symptoms. ""If anyone wants to believe that dementia did not run in the Trump family, it's just not true.""

There is a noticeable difference in how he speaks. I know, everyone gets older, it’s to be expected, but he’s clearly declining mentally. I am not saying it’s full blown dementia or anything, but we want the president to be someone that’s at their best. We don’t want someone that’s clearly in mental decline.

Here’s an example. This is trying to show he wasn’t really mocking a disabled reporter, I don’t know if I buy it, but that’s not really the point here, listen to him speak here and compare it to any of his speeches now.

The technical term is [disinhibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinhibition), and yes, it's a symptom of dementia (and also certain types of brain injury and various psychiatric problems).

"It also doesn't have to be something he's always done (probably is in this case but w/e). My grandma never told or even laughed at an off color joke in her life until she was in a memory care unit.

I saw a comment a while ago saying that the discourse around Biden and Trump is showing who's spent time around dementia patients and who hasn't. Biden reminds me of my 85 year old dad, he's clearly older, slower, and can't be trusted to run the country for another 4 years, but he's still there. Trump reminds me much more of my Grandma, who got less patient and angrier as her memory deteriorated, well before we could tell.

I'm not *positive* Trump has dementia, nor am I positive Biden doesn't, though it's obvious that neither are the same as they were eight or even four years ago. But if I had to bet on one, it'd be Trump in a heartbeat. Blustering loudly is actually a really common way for people with dementia to try to hide it, and since Trump has a preternatural knack for bluster, it'd be easy for decline to go relatively unnoticed.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

We had an old woman who was a total sweetheart, but she masturbated anywhere and everywhere. She also had the hots for one of our male CNAs, and that was super awkward for him. Another lady was NOT a super sweetheart, but she had a thing for a young male CNA. She once had him verbally trapped, and he looked at me and mouthed “HELP ME!” I had to make up an excuse that I really needed his help so he could extricate himself.

But, the halfway competent “managers” are ALL long gone and not to return (they were not “loyal” enough)…and so, I am far more concerned with Trump turning one of our periodically recurring foreign policy emergencies, ala 9/11, or Iraq invading Kuwait, perhaps Russia escalating in Ukraine, or so thing similar to Panama in the 80s, or Syria in 2014-2017, etc etc…into a full fledged nuclear holocaust via his heavy handed, grossly under-informed / misinformed, style of (mis)management.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Two immediate takeaways:

2. Looking at Trump and Marla Maples’ wedding photo, I can see that fake hair runs in the family as well. Fred, Sr.’s toupee is just awful, and I’m pretty sure that’s a wig on Trump’s mother.

"For what it’s worth, dementia is not slipping into blissful ignorance and living your days out peacefully. It is a scary process for everyone involved, but especially the dementia sufferer. At many times, it means being in constant fear.

That fear coupled with lack of comprehension causes a person to lash out at everyone around them. It basically reverts their reasoning to a toddler’s, so they only know the most basic of emotions, and get instantly cranky when they don’t get their way.

What we’re seeing with Trump: the ataxia, slurred speech, listless expressions and violent anger at the most minor inconveniences (like the permanent microphone stand on a podium not being at his preferred height); these are all very strong indicators that The Dump is actively experiencing dementia.

This bag of poo is having a miserable time, and everyone propping him up is as well. Dementia is not a free pass from his sins; if anything, it’s the only real consequence he’s seen in his entire life.

As someone who wanted to die many, many times because of the laws his people have pushed, and also as someone who has lost their whole family to his evil cult, I hope the suffering is as drawn out as possible.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"At the risk of sounding a bit loopy (because this even sounds weird in my head) I feel like humanity has turned into a pack of negative sculptors, armed with verbal chisels.

"A dozen Black canvassers were tricked, threatened, and driven in seatless U-Haul vans. They were fired en masse after WIRED reported on their plight—without full pay or a way back home.

This comes after the canvassers and paid door knockers for Donald Trump, contracted by a firm associated with America PAC, told WIRED they were subjected to poor working conditions: A number of them have been driven around in the back of a seatless U-Haul van, according to video obtained by WIRED, and threatened that their lodging at a local motel wouldn’t be paid for if they didn’t meet canvassing quotas. Tyra Muldrow, one of the canvassers who has since been fired said she didn’t even know they were signing up for anything to do with Musk or Trump.

"”Muldrow and the rest of her canvassing group of roughly a dozen people had just been fired en masse, after [WIRED reported](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-america-pac-blitz-canvassing-michigan-uhaul/) that they had been tricked and threatened as part of Musk’s get-out-the-vote effort. Speaking publicly for the first time about her ordeal, Muldrow says that the canvassers in her group were fired with little explanation beyond a complaint that someone had spoken with the press. Many, including her, were still owed money. Muldrow had to find her own way home; others are still stranded in Michigan.

A representative for Musk and America PAC did not return a request for comment.

On October 15, Muldrow’s cousin Ebony Jones recruited her for the job, offering upwards of $2,000 per week and a return flight, per emails reviewed by WIRED. Muldrow signed a nondisclosure agreement the same day, and was then flown to Michigan on October 18 as part of a campaign for Blitz Canvassing, a subcontractor which had [received more than $9 million from America PAC](https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00879510/1844622/se) for presidential campaign canvassing as of October 29. Only upon her arrival in Michigan did Muldrow realize what this job would really entail: canvassing for Trump.

No one in her group of contractors—referred to internally as a “cell”—had a driver’s license. They were initially transported via Ubers, and were then driven back and forth for nearly two weeks in a pair of seatless U-Haul vans between their targeted neighborhoods, staying in a series of motels and AirBnBs in the Detroit suburbs of Warren, Livonia, and Mount Clemens.“

"Lol okay, buddy. Allow me to introduce you to the DoJ definition of human trafficking:

> The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and its subsequent reauthorizations recognize and define two primary forms of human trafficking:

>Sex trafficking is the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age. (22 U.S.C. § 7102(11)(A)).

>**Forced labor is the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. (22 U.S.C. § 7102(11)(B)).**

"I hate titles like this.  It absolutely does not point to a Harris landslide.  It points to Harris possibly winning Iowa within the margin of error.  It doesn't apply, at all, to other states, the popular vote, or in particular the electoral college vote.

That said, it doesn't mean positive moves in Iowa won't be reflected elsewhere, but it's *possible* the changes in Iowa will be reflected elsewhere.  The Bulwark podcast had Anne Seltzer on today which gives a good overview of the poll.  The most promising aspect is that there was a sizable swing in older female voters from Trump to Harris (which is probably why Harris has been courting moderate Republicans quite heavily), what's most impressive is that move was done without either candidate doing much in the way of advertising in the state.  The other reason is in Iowa there was anti-abortion legislation that recently passed so female voters in particular are motivated to vote.  That also applies in some other states but not all, though the right to to manage their own healthcare is obviously the huge issue with female voters this time around.

All that's to say it's still likely to be very, very close.  I hope Harris blows Trump out of the water on both the EC and the popular vote, but what goes in Iowa doesn't necessarily go anywhere else (except maybe Wisconsin to a degree).",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Hillary made it through the primaries as the appointed nominee but the consistent unexpected success of a token challenge from Bernie Sanders hinted that a lot of voters weren’t happy with her as nominee.

The polls consistently showed her as ahead until a couple of ones in October showed warning signs that her support was slipping. An October surprise reminded a lot of voters about what they didn’t like about her and they stayed home or switched to her opponent. 

Trump has played out an echo of the same thing. The GOP primaries hinted at a potentially devastating divide in the GOP. He did well in the first debate and thought he was cruising to an easy victory. Then everything since September onwards has reminded voters why they don’t like him and booted him back in 2020. He has done a little better at campaigning in swing states but he has done a lot of campaigning in states that don’t matter and has been ignoring several that are presumed safe despite them traditionally being more purple.

"Final Selzer Iowa polls in last Presidential elections, and the actual result in parentheses:

2024 - Harris +3 (TBD)

2020 - Trump +7 (+8)

2016 - Trump +7 (+9)

2012 - Obama +5 (+6)

2008 - Obama +17 (+9)

~~2004 - Bush +3 (+0.7%)~~

**2004 - Kerry +5 (Bush won 49.9% - 49.2%)**

(EDIT - I was wrong on 2004, she missed that one)

She has been very accurate, with the exception of 2008 with Obama (*EDIT -- and missed the call for 2004, my original comment was wrong*). She did correctly predict Obama's victory in Iowa that election, but she was off by 8 points.

I sure hope she keeps her streak. It would be a stunning reversal for Trump in the state to win it by 8 and 9 points in the prior two elections, only to lose this year. The hope is that the difference this year compared to 4 years ago isn't so much party-switchers, but motivating new voters to the polls, especially older women who weren't reliable voters in the past.

Update - here is a good summary of all the final Presidential polls the Des Moines Register did with Selzer going back to 2004 - [https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/11/02/how-do-past-iowa-poll-results-compare-to-iowa-election-results/76018755007/](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/11/02/how-do-past-iowa-poll-results-compare-to-iowa-election-results/76018755007/)",2024_11_04,06_23_09
Five points. 2018.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
I thought she was off 3 in one or two of her polls since 2012. Either way your point still stands- remarkably accurate and reliable.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Yeah but margin of error for a lead works differently than the margin of error for gauge of support. 

So using your example, if we asked people if they preferred red or blue, and we got 55% red and 45% blue and the margin of error for a single color is 5%, that means we expect 50-60% support for red 95% of the time. 

However, the margin of error for the lead of Red vs Blue would be double than the margin of error for individual support. Since it follows that if you overestimated one colors share, you underestimated the other colors share. 

So if it’s 5% for individual support, then the margin of error for the lead is 10% in each direction. So the lead for red can be as much as much as +20 or it can be a tie. If the margin of the lead does not contain 0, then it usually means it’s statistically reliable, if it does contain 0, then it might be due to sampling. 

So the margin of error for Kamala’s lead in this poll is 6.8%. So she could be ahead as much as 9.8 or only trailing as much by -3.8. Even if the poll is within that margin of error for her lead, Trump leading by just 3.8% in a non-swing state, which he won by about 10% each time before, it looks promising.

"Statistician here! Thing to remember -- states don't exist in total isolation. State boundaries are basically imaginary lines. People in Iowa really aren't terribly different from people in Texas. Sure there are things like the urban/rural divide that result in places like California being _really_ blue or Alabama _really_ red, but in general, whatever variables are dragging one state in a direction will frequently drag other states in the same direction.

Case in point, in 2016, the entire country got redder. Even though Clinton got more votes, she got them in the wrong places, specifically in large urban places. She ran a bad campaign and she lacked the enthusiasm of the Trump campaign, and more first time voters and low propensity voters broke for Trump.

Now, I'm sure there are plenty of reasons to speculate exactly _why_ the country seems to be getting bluer, but if the Seltzer report is to be believed, Iowa has experienced an 11 point shift towards Harris. That would mean she's all but certain to clench the swing states, and we should expect that other ""lean Republican"" states to flip as well.

Now to actually get to the point I'm trying to make. Trump won Iowa by 8 points in 2020. He won Texas by 5.5 (and by 9 points in 2016). Texas is getting bluer anyway due to shifting demographics, but if that Iowa polling shift translates to votes, Texas would only need _half_ of that shift to flip to Harris.

For instance if you told me in early 2008 that the Democratic candidate was going to win IN, I would have laughed at you and/or leveraged every financial resource I could get to bet on the Dems winning the presidency. The idea a deep red state like Indiana going blue meant that every battleground state was going blue, since IN is like a more red leaning version of WI, OH, MI and to a lesser extent PA.

I’m reciting just from memory but it has swung from Trump +18(!!) over Biden, to Trump +4 over Harris, to Harris +3. All within the span of a few months. The GOP was expecting that number to go back towards about +8-9 for Trump.

The weighting to create a horse race isn’t important here. The higher quality polls are consistently showing a strong swing towards Harris. It’s very similar to the break towards Trump in the final week of the 2016 cycle.  Combine that with the demographic data coming from these record levels of early voting, and the people who predicted a strong election for the Democrats are looking increasingly on the money.

>Yeah, it *is* a bad thing and it's directly the fault of progressives thinking their vote can be used as a punishment rather than to do the actual, effective work that the right has been doing for decades.



It's not the left's fault that the democratic party is deeply incompetent. Also, if it's a bad thing maybe don't support it? Your vote is the only leverage you have, it has to be earned, it's not owed.



>The *left* is whining and crying about whether they should vote or proclaiming they are voting 3rd party. There's *countless* leftists claiming there's *nothing* she could do to earn their vote.



Sure, why is that? Why are there people on the left that would never consider voting for the Dems? What did the Democrats do in the last decades in the US and in the world? We weren't talking about those people tho, you're merging them with the people willing to vote for Harris.



>And nope. Biden is *very* progressive as far as US presidents go. But Kamala is further left and has a voting record and policy standing behind this. She's broken so many senate ties.



Biden governed to the left of his record (except on Israel ofc). Kamala is running to the right of Biden and I don't see any reason to believe she will govern to the left of her campaign.

Worth keeping in mind that the swing states calculations are based on a fixed position in the consistent states.

"I hope you heard him this weekend 

He said - When I heard the death toll after Helene I knew it was going to be bad for the election. 

He means VP Harris. 

Look at who voted against FEMA funding before the hurricane, his MAGA members of congress. Most likely because he knew if a hurricane was big enough to cause damage it would “be bad for the Democrats”. However that meant putting FL, GA, NC, SC, TN, and VA in harms way. That meant letting some republicans die, letting Republican towns get destroyed, letting republican businesses get washed away, letting history and family farms be destroyed to gain some election points. 

Then President Biden asked to get money because the damage was done and historic and without it more people will suffer. Americans will suffer. Speaker Mike Johnson (R) said no. 

Knowing another hurricane is inbound to the Republican stronghold of FL Biden again makes a request and is denied. The MAGA party is telling people President Biden controls the weather and is targeting red states. If true they made no effort to force Speaker Johnson to vote for more money for FEMA as a historic disaster threatened FL. Likely because if one disaster was good for the election then two is great.

"One example is how they got Christians to vote Republican, even though Democrats align more with Christian values. It was all a con to get votes:

> Paul Weyrich, the late religious conservative political activist and co-founder of the Heritage Foundation, saw his opening.
>
> “The new political philosophy must be defined by us [conservatives] in moral terms, packaged in non-religious language, and propagated throughout the country by our new coalition,” Weyrich wrote in the mid-1970s. “When political power is achieved, the moral majority will have the opportunity to re-create this great nation.” Weyrich believed that the political possibilities of such a coalition were unlimited. “The leadership, moral philosophy, and workable vehicle are at hand just waiting to be blended and activated,” he wrote. “If the moral majority acts, results could well exceed our wildest dreams.”
>
> But this hypothetical “moral majority” needed a catalyst—a standard around which to rally. For nearly two decades, Weyrich, by his own account, had been trying out different issues, hoping one might pique evangelical interest: pornography, prayer in schools, the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, even abortion. “I was trying to get these people interested in those issues and I utterly failed,” Weyrich recalled at a conference in 1990.
>
> Weyrich, Falwell and leaders of the emerging religious right enlisted an unlikely ally in their quest to advance abortion as a political issue: Francis A. Schaeffer—a goateed, knickers-wearing theologian who was warning about the eclipse of Christian values and the advance of something he called “secular humanism.” Schaeffer, considered by many the intellectual godfather of the religious right, was not known for his political activism, but by the late 1970s he decided that legalized abortion would lead inevitably to infanticide and euthanasia, and he was eager to sound the alarm.
>
> Schaeffer teamed with a pediatric surgeon, C. Everett Koop, to produce a series of films entitled “Whatever Happened to the Human Race?” In the early months of 1979, Schaeffer and Koop, targeting an evangelical audience, toured the country with these films, which depicted the scourge of abortion in graphic terms—most memorably with a scene of plastic baby dolls strewn along the shores of the Dead Sea. Schaeffer and Koop argued that any society that countenanced abortion was captive to “secular humanism” and therefore caught in a vortex of moral decay.

">I don't need to google things.

Maybe you should because the inflation data is particularly embarrassing for Trump.

Inflation started going through the charts basically as soon as Biden stepped into office.  It very clearly did *not* have actually have anything to do with Biden.  How could it?  It began its crazy upward journey in January 2021.  He wasn't even president until the January 6th.

It's very obviously the result of Trump administration policy and legislation.  The data is very clear on this.

It reaches its peak some time around June 2022, and then it starts dropping back to previous levels, where it likely would have been had it not started to spike like it did.

The graphs genuinely look like someone set fire to things right before leaving and the Biden administration came in with a fire extinguisher.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Look, I get where you’re coming from, but there are some things to consider. Obama inherited an economy in freefall and managed to turn it around with steady job growth and recovery. Trump came into office with that momentum already in place, yet his policies—like tax cuts that mostly benefited the wealthy—led to a bigger national debt. And then there’s his trade war with China, which actually hurt American farmers and businesses more than it helped.

When Biden took over, he faced an economy wrecked by both the pandemic and some of Trump’s decisions, yet we’ve managed to avoid a recession so far. Supporting Trump might seem appealing to some, but the long-term effects of his policies—ballooning debt, alienating allies, and unstable markets—could do more harm than good.

"That doesn't really matter if inflation started going up as soon as Biden got into office. His horrendous, evil energy policy combined with insane government spending and the flooding of the country with illegal immigrants forced the hand of the fed to move the interest rates and created the disaster that we're in now. The president can take actions to control inflation, his actions exacerbated it. And to add insult to injury, he had an ""Inflation Reduction Act"" which contained absolutely no remedy to inflation as some sort of horrific Orwellian nightmare. And you're STILL going to vote for these lunatics.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"The ""steady job growth and recovery"" was at the expense of issuing highly attractive free loans to rich bankers who were the ones who helped crash the economy in the first place. Most of the problems we see now with these predatory companies coming in and swooping up everything with full financial control is a direct result of Obama's policies. 

Tax cuts did not lead to bigger national debt. Prior to world war 2, there was virtually no income tax. What happens is when you tax incomes, be it for the middle or upper class, it causes wealthy people to hire less and middle class and poor people to work less. If the tax cuts are aligning with GDP growth then it is a net benefit for the economy.

The trade war with China did not hurt anyone. People say that but it just didn't happen. Inflation was exactly where it needed to be in an optimal U.S. economy at the time Trump was president. The inflation we see now started with the Biden administration's second year, which was a direct result of excessive government spending and the most atrocious, evil energy policy in United States history. The reason things are even worse are because the Biden administration had no idea how to set controls or limits on anything they were doing, so they forced the hand of federal reserve to hike the interest rates which instantly made everything even more unaffordable and killed much of the hot job market, which we now see in the recent jobs report which shows a net loss of public sector jobs. And all this is before we even get into the disasterous economic results of letting 20 million poor people seeking shelter and resources, some being criminals, into the country.

What you're saying just simply isn't true, but I don't blame you because the media sources you digest probably don't even report on it. The record high inflation and terrible job market are a direct result of Biden's policies and people who vote for Kamala Harris are sadly just going to prolong this misery for four more years.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Honestly, there’s a lot to unpack here, so let’s look at a few things.

First, on the “free loans to bankers” during the Obama years—yeah, it’s frustrating. The Fed did support banks, but Obama also led the economy out of the 2008 crash with consistent job growth that benefited a lot of everyday people. Corporate influence is a huge issue, but it’s been around for decades; he didn’t create it.

On Trump’s tax cuts: it’s a stretch to say they didn’t add to the debt. Those cuts tacked on over a trillion dollars, mostly benefiting corporations and the wealthy. The promised job boom didn’t really happen; instead, we saw increased corporate profits without much trickle-down to everyday workers.

The trade war with China? That hit American farmers and manufacturers hard, leading to billions in government bailouts just to keep some businesses afloat. Plus, U.S. businesses relying on imports saw costs rise, which often means higher prices for consumers. Even if inflation was stable then, the ripple effects of those tariffs are part of the supply chain mess we’re dealing with now.

And on inflation—it’s not just a “Biden issue.” Inflation is up around the world due to supply chain disruptions, energy markets, and global recovery from COVID. Biden’s energy policies might feel like a tough shift, but they aim to reduce our dependence on oil long-term, which most experts agree is critical.

When it comes to proposals from Harris (and the Biden administration) versus Trump’s approach, economists generally favor Harris’s focus on investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and workforce training, seeing them as steps to create sustainable growth. By contrast, experts criticized Trump’s policies for prioritizing short-term gains, like tax cuts for the wealthy, over long-term economic resilience. Even on trade, many economists saw Trump’s tariffs as disruptive without a clear benefit for American workers or consumers. 

In short, experts tend to agree that Harris’s proposals are aimed at building a more stable, resilient economy, while Trump’s policies often prioritized short-term wins but left some significant vulnerabilities behind. Other than the economy, are there other reasons you support Trump? Thanks for sharing your thoughts in more detail by the way.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

I cannot fathom how the GOP has lost its backbone and devolved to a rudderless, populist party, pandering to the lowest denominator under Trump.

IMO Romney was possibly the best President that the US never had, but ran against an irresistible force in Obama.

Had Romney not experienced the crushing loss to Obama in 2012, could Trump have beaten him in the primaries and would we ever have witnessed the hate-based cult of Trump??

> Liz Cheney says she is pro-life but state abortion bans ‘cannot stand’

> “You have pro-life women all across this country who have been watching what’s happened in places like Texas and places like North Carolina, where since Roe was overturned, you’ve had laws put in place at the state level that are preventing women form getting life saving care,” Cheney said.

> Cheney provided examples of women who may need an abortion for life-saving care or have a miscarriage that now can’t receive care because Republican-led states have implemented restrictions to the procedure after Roe v. Wade was overturned.

> “I think that’s where you have women, who, like me, have been pro-life who are saying, no this, what we have seen, cannot stand,” she said.

Sure, it's not like she's gone entirely pro-choice. And yes, there is a certain cruel FAFO to her process, where it took women actually dying of pregnancy complications to compel her change of heart.

HOWEVER, GOP policies pre Trump and clearly after he's gone are ALSO harmful to democracy and society.

Only in the sense that he's trying to speedrun the process the GOP has been trying to do for decades. They stole a court seat, they gerrymander more commonly and more severely than Democrats, they stand for voter suppression policies and tactics, they don't believe in social equality...

My favorite example of that is John McCain, whose overaggressive pursuit of banking deregulation was directly responsible for the S&L crash of the 1980's and a deep recession that forced George H.W. Bush out of office. Despite that, he continued to stump for deregulation all the way up to 2008, when then-presidential-candidate McCain declared that the economic fundamentals of the heavily-deregulated subprime mortgage industry were ""sound"" immediately before it all crashed and caused a depression.

"A lot to explain to you here. I was clear when I said ""modal"" politician. Respond to that point if you want to, but I won't engage in some contrived situation that is clearly not what I meant.

You are confusing ideology with partisanship, which is an incredibly common mistake that people make. People who always vote for Democrats don't, inherently, mindlessly follow a party for example. It is simply because the Democrats are the closest to their preferred policy positions. Someone can easily be an extreme far leftist and consistently vote Democratic simply because there is no better option. That doesn't mean they are as you describe partisans. 

However, by saying you are a centrist what you are saying is that you don't have policy positions because your ""central"" position is simply a function of the Downsian median voter theory. There is no policy position or ideology about centrists because centrism is inherently, and necessarily, bereft of those. It has to be, by definition.

That is the whole problem with centrists in any political context, their ideological position is simply a function of the electoral system they live in, not one based in theories of democracy, human rights, and economics. Of course some people do just mindlessly vote for parties, but that isn't what we are talking about here. You are positioning yourself as being ""independent"" but all that really means is that you can't articulate what you believe in.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"That is not what that word means in any political context. If you want to call yourself that feel free, but how we define centrists and what being a centrist means is not that.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"This. And doing so (assessment based on list Vs Letter) is part of the key to walk our political system back from the precipice Trump led it to.

Ideological purity is largely what got us into this mess, and we need to be able to see shades of grey, and work with imperfect people on common goals that are positive.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"That’s where you’d be wrong. We have what’s called “chain immigration” now vs what used to be the quota system. Only reason chain immigration passed is because Republicans thought it would allow less brown people in, not more. Republicans also are the ones attacking people for being DEI and have shown, even before Trump, massive racism such as the birther junk with Obama. Not every Republican is racist, but most are. The rest are too ignorant to spot racism and end up going with it anyway",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"So your claim here is that the dictionary definition of “centrist” is “a person who doesn’t know what they believe?”

That’s the argument you’re going with?",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"No, that the political science definition and the colloquial definition mean that. That the way this person is describing themselves is that. That you deciding you want it to mean something else doesn't mean that it means that. Words have meaning, dude.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"You said:

> Centrist is just another word for not having any clear idea what you believe in.

So either you’re offering a definition or you’re using a bit of figurative language.

If you’re being less-than-precise in describing centrism, then on what grounds is your response to me that I’m ignoring the meaning of the word?

What even are you trying to say here?",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"You seem rather confused. I am responding to someone who posited a specific definition of centrism, which is a faulty one as it conflates ideology and partisanship. You put forth an even more faulty definition that is fully undermined by the logical failures in it. The issue, beyond your bad definition of the word, is that it is not how centrism is deployed in any scholarly or colloquial context.

But fine, let's take your definition. It is nonsensical. What it comes off as you are trying to say is you are pragmatic. Being a non-centrist doesn't inherently mean you don't know the world is complicated or that you have to live in a society. Moreover, many ""centrist"" policies have serious second-order effects or are downright ineffectual simply because of their needing to fit competing worldviews. Centrist policies aren't ""better"" they are just what can pass in a particular electoral system. A different country would produce a different ""centrist"" policy.

There is no value or superiority to being ""centrist"". People who claim they are centrist don't understand the world better, or know more. Research on political independents in the United States places them as being no better informed than the more extreme political ideologues.

Now if you want to call yourself a pragmatic, fine. That is one way to look at the world, but it is also not a political ideology (which is what kicked off this whole conversation).",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Look, I think Elon is a giant knob but let me help you out on explaining the Tesla in space. 

That happened because they were doing a first full test launch of a new heavy lift rocket. Usually when you do that sort of thing you don’t put a real payload on the rocket because there’s a decent chance that the rocket could blow up, so most of the time companies use a mass simulator - just heavy stuff that weighs about the same as the operational payload. SpaceX used a Tesla as a mass simulator because they knew that it would get a lot of attention and cool pictures. 

Regardless though, some amount of something heavy that you could classify as junk was going to be flung out past Mars because that is the lift trajectory they wanted to test.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"I suspect Musk tilted just because Trump offered him something that money can't buy so easy... an authoritative position in government that would allow Musk to put a chokehold on his corporate competitors (domestic and foreign) while changing laws and throwing Federal taxpayer money into his own business interests.  And, of course, Musk businesses get waivers from Trump's universal tariffs. 

In return, Musk turned Xitter into a Trump political machine. 

The security clearance is a real and serious concern, but probably not one that was influencing Musks decision making.  Billionaires live their lives with no real belief that consequences exist, and if you look at the world that's generally how things play out. 

But they go apeshit over opportunities to get even more money and power. 

If Harris does win the election, however, Musk is in a world of hurt because he became overtly political, and this is something that people with criminal liability really should not do.  Including, hopefully, some investigation to Musks very high security clearance and very high friendship with Vladimir Putin. 

The US seems to have adopted a very high tolerance for traitors and seditionists, and that should probably change.  Harris, a prosecutor and DA, is just the kind of person to make that change.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Society/the economy are *straining* to feed him and are getting sickened in return.  We need to stop this.

Trump is his ticket to that: Trump will give him direct power and influence, which will lead to more wealth, more praise on X from his fans, etc.  And he has already admitted it will create vast harships and struggles for average Americans to feed Musk's ego and endless hunger.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"I don’t think it was anything so sophisticated. I think Musk had a decades long understanding that the rules don’t necessarily apply to the rich. I think it was far more basic. A Trump administration is an administration where presidential power has an easy to find price tag, there is no need to play any kind of political game to get it. It is purely pay to win and instantly unlock all trophies. That they and their respective bases all hate trans people is just a bonus. ",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"> Is that why Elon ran to Trump when Harris put the business pants on immigration?

There is a possibility that Musk really means what he says when he claims Trump is the only president that could get humanity to Mars.

Musk has been experiencing a lot of frustration with the FAA about delayed licenses for his Starship launches because of … well, due process. Inhibited by some bad faith actors, it seems, but due process nonetheless. 

Musk sees that Trump doesn’t care about due process whatsoever and may think that if he supports Trump, then Trump will let him launch however much he wants whenever he wants, which he probably thinks will speed up SpaceX’s road to Mars. Such a view, that the end justifies the means – and humanity needs to get to Mars to survive – would be consistent with Musk’s behaviour for the past two decades. 

Then again, Musk’s behaviour lately has been much more erratic than before, so I’m not even convincing myself here. To be honest, I think Musk has just lost it. 

But there may be some remnants of his former thinking about Mars that ultimately drives his now-erratic behaviour. Maybe what I described is what he tells himself. ",2024_11_04,06_23_09

I imagine that's why his spaceships are planned to carry literally hundreds. Whoever gets there first has a good claim on ownership, and this is what Musk wants: he wants to stake his own personal claim on the Red Planet. He is looking for a way to *own* Mars.

A juxtaposition that most Christian conservatives don't care about.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
"This is a short but interesting article about Harris's religious life. She identifies as a Baptist. Her Hindu mother sent Harris and her sister to the Baptist Church so they would grow up to be ""strong Black women"". She is, of course, married to a Jewish man, and her family participates in both Christian and Jewish cultures. She calls her pastor to pray together before major decisions.

I'm an atheist, and I don't really like how much influence religion has on our politics. But Harris strikes me as the kind of Christian who emphasizes unity and kindness. I see her as probably similar to Obama: someone with the ability to draw from multiple faiths to reach across our divides. I can respect Christians like that.

> Harris finished her remarks in about 11 minutes - starting and ending during Trump&#039;s roughly 90-minute speech at a chilly outdoor rally at the Lancaster, Pennsylvania, airport.

> Trump usually veers from subject to subject, a discursive style he has labeled &quot;The weave.&quot; But in Lancaster, he went on long tangents and hardly mentioned his usual points on the economy, immigration and rote criticisms of Harris.

I have family members that are functionally illiterate and you would be surprised how they can hide it. They develop a really good memory, because they have to. But they need to hear things or watch them be done, to really learn new stuff. Epstein confirmed that Trump is functionally illiterate.

His fetish of trying to bang his “friends” wives wasn’t shocking. Nor was Epstein’s summary about Trump’s behavior or mental mindset. The most shocking thing about the Trump “era” is the number of people willing to support and promote him. 40 to 45% of Americans was pretty shocking. I would have assumed around 25 to 30% tops. But I guess we need to thank him for shining the light on who we really are. Or at least some of us. But the positive thing was seeing how many people weren’t buying and supporting the bullshit he was selling. It’s a little scary how easy it is to manipulate so many human beings.

There are other ways (let’s call them “Z”) to be against murder—namely, empirically-based evidence for the impacts of certain governmental policies and a goal of maximizing material wellbeing.

If you don’t have Z, you should not implement government policy, and if you only have X, you should not implement government policy. If you have both X and Z, you’re good!

"> wannabe dictator, 

Also rapist and abuser, and fraudster, and a liar and a cheat. The rapist part seems most significant in light of this story.

Back when I was teaching high school in the 1980s, one of my best students started missing classes. I asker her why and she said she was being abused by her step-dad. I reported this to the school counsellor, who called the police. I checked back with the school counsellor a week or so later, and I was told the police had  investigated, and had not found enough physical evidence to do anything. Meanwhile my student had started sleeping in the park.

If only I'd had half the brains of Kamala Harris! My student's best friend from kindergarten was in the class, and I could have brought them together. If I'd brought them together and we had talked out the situation, she probably would have been able to stay with her friend for the last semester of high school, instead of being a homeless person.

It still would have been a pretty awful solution, but if the police decide not to act, what can you do?",2024_11_04,06_23_09

> It's more profitable for them to let some units sit empty than to start undercutting each other. 

No it isn't, that's not how any economics works anywhere, unless it's a monopoly. In which case there's STILL no incentive to leave units empty, since you STILL lose money as a monopolist having to pay upkeep and property tax with no income.

(The prices would all be higher than competitive ones but still low enough to fill the units).

Some units remain empty while just trying to find a good tenant, or if there's a solid reason why the market is known to shift soon like during the summer in a university town waiting for the next semester to start.

"Municipalities should enact a ""Vacancy Tax"", which taxes unoccupied residential dwellings. The proceeds from this tax should go to grants and loans to build low income housing, services like health and housing for homeless, rental assistance for low income, down payment assistance for first time home buyers, etc.

Short term stays like AirBnB do not count as ""Occupied"". ""Occupied"" would need to be defined as being occupied by the owner of the property for at least x months a year or having a renter living in the property as their primary residence.

If you don't wanna pay the ""Vacancy Tax"", sell it, or rent it out. If nobody wants to buy or rent it, lower your ask until it's occupied.

edit: Properties primarily used for AirBnB and other such businesses should be re-classified as some sort of ""Temporary Commercial"" and taxed appropriately. When the property is no longer used for commercial purposes, its classification should be reverted back to residential. Operating an improperly zoned business like this should have steep fines.

>“We’ve demonstrated since 2017 that continually investing in organizing, especially young voters, is so important, and so I’m using the organization that I’ve built and putting it back to work,” Ossoff said in an interview with POLITICO, after launching a canvass effort in a strip mall parking lot alongside Warnock, Democratic House candidate Wade Herring and Savannah Mayor Van R. Johnson.

>“I have gone up to people to talk about the election and had them look me in the eye and say, ‘No, I already voted for these people,’” he said. “Then, we have to explain to people, ‘Yeah, we had a primary, then we had a primary runoff and now you’ve got to go again.’”

>“And you’ll probably have to go in December and do it one more time,” he added.

>A post-election analysis of Ossoff’s field program, conducted by former campaign aides in the spring of 2021, estimated that Ossoff’s “paid relational” organizing program, paired with a traditional volunteer field organization, boosted turnout by 3.8 percent among 160,000 voters targeted. Ossoff and Warnock won their 2021 runoffs by 55,232 votes and 93,550 votes respectively.

>The idea behind paid relational organizing is this: Ossoff campaign hired 2,800 Georgians, particularly those with little or no voting history themselves, to become “community mobilizers” — a term Ossoff coined for their role. The campaign suspected that those organizers would be well-positioned to influence irregular voters or nonvoters in their own personal networks to get involved.

>“We have been able to significantly increase turnout and participation by young voters and voters who are typically ignored and written off,” Ossoff continued.

>Ossoff’s efforts join a sprawling network of field operations in the state, spearheaded by Warnock and Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor. A number of get-out-the-vote nonprofits are also involved, as Democrats look for a way to close strong after several weeks of public polling gains by GOP Senate candidates, including Walker.

>I’ve noticed one Democratic candidate who defies this trend. While consultants and organizers talk about the need for rural talking points and investments in rural newspaper and radio buys, this politician has deployed the most obvious strategy for making inroads with rural voters: He showed up in every county in his state.

>Then, he did something really remarkable: He showed up again.

>The attention a high-profile candidate like Fetterman has paid to rural areas of his state may begin to ease the rural inferiority complex that’s been festering for decades, as rural economies have stagnated, small towns have lost population and country folks have become the butt of jokes. One 27-year-old woman in Westmoreland County, part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area that struggles against the “Pennsyltucky” stereotype, praised Fetterman for showing up and speaking bluntly.

Some people may be swept up in it. But a lot of these people were always assholes but had learned to keep their smassholery to themselves.

"It's okay to call Republicans Nazis when they support a man who says he needs his Generals to be more like Hitler's.

It's okay to call Republicans Nazis when they cheer for and support fascist policies. 

If Democrats were calling for the government to take control of all private business you'd be right in calling Democrats communist. If Kamala was going on about America's great leap forward you'd be right calling Kamala supporters communists.

Words have meaning, and if you act and support policies that are fascist and your leader wants America to closer resemble Nazi Germany... Well... What else would you call that person? 

""America is for Americans only"", ""immigrants are tainting the blood of America"", ""the immigrants are eating the dogs and cats""... That's incredibly on the nose and is Trump openly saying ""I'm a fascist.""

If you don't want America supporting our allies, you are a shitty American. 

If you don't like immigration, then don't vote for the man who tables the bipartisan immigration bill.

If you want a job and a strong economy, don't vote for the man promising to destroy it with a trade war and creating 33 Trillion dollars of debt (according to the American Tax Institute).

So if it isn't any of those things because Trump's plans are to actually make them worse... Then I am going to assume it's all the Nazi stuff you really like. Because that's the only thing that makes sense; why else would you want to run America into the ground?

Trump is a rapist. Trump is a criminal. Trump was best friends with Jeffrey Epstein. Trump tried to nuke a hurricane. Trump killed millions of Americans during COVID. Trump started a trade war with China costing us 27 billion dollars during his term alone just in agriculture. Trump ended his term with skyrocketing inflation and debt. Trump ended his term losing jobs. Trump ended his term by trump to subvert democracy and steal the election like a dictator. Trump stole our national security secrets and let our enemies see them.

There was a time before Hitler did all of those things too, when he was just a guy with a silly mustache who said crazy things.

It's worth noting that the MOE is ~6 percent, so Trump could feasibly have a 3 point lead in Iowa. But even if Harris doesn't win there, the relative closeness implies Trump is considerably weaker in the rest of the Midwest than most of the other pollsters seem to be saying.

"The key is supposed to be to look at a large number of polls and look for trends.  The margin of error is there because of math, and is basically impossible to get rid of.

Imagine an election between heads and tails that is as much of a 50-50 race as you can get. If you poll 200 people, you are mathematically very unlikely to get 100-100.  Numbers in the 90-110 range are what you would expect.  So you would report heads +5, but that would be within your 7 or so point margin of error.  (you can do this yourself if you want, either by flipping coins or making a quick excel program).  

What happens with pollsters is that they expect a 50-50 race, and they know if they say heads+5 they will be laughed at, so they weigh different numbers. For example they may say that every fourth flip is more representative, so instead of getting a value of .25, they will give it a value of .28.  And this makes the poll now say heads+1, and more in line.

As for Nate Silver, I think it's a bit more complicated. He has a vested interest in the polling industry being right, but at the same time if it *is* way off, he has a vested interest in being the first person to point that out, because he can then go down as the expert who saw the polls would be off when nobody else did. This is pretty much what happened in 2012, when he said Obama was the clear favorite even when everyone else said the election was a tie, and being right on that gave a huge boost to his career.

One Iowa detail to bear in mind is that they did ban abortions after 6 weeks. That’s one reason that Iowa might be particularly high for women turning out for Harris, although it’s not the only state that’s done this, its more than a dozen now.

If that happens all the polls will be wrong, that turnout isn’t built into their models. It’s a bit off for NYTimes to do that as much as they are, but it’s better than everyone clustering around the wrong assumptions, which is what almost all the polls seem to be doing currently.

""I was surprised at how difficult and how risky pregnancy was for me, but I assumed those risks with the knowledge that my health care team would do everything possible to help me deliver a healthy baby — and that ultimately, my health was paramount,"" writes India. ""I never worried that I might die because a doctor refused to treat me. That assurance no longer exists for women across the United States. I voted early for Kamala Harris in Tennessee, where many of our leaders seem to believe protecting guns is more important than protecting women’s lives. I trust Ms. Harris to do better than them. If you make a different choice, do so knowing that our lives are on the line.""

"Are you seriously unaware of Biden's entire record of 50+ years in politics?!

As President, he's moved a bit to the left (in American terms), thanks to Obama, but there's a mountain of reasons he was in last place in the 2016 Democratic primary before the 1% put their thumbs on the scales before Super Tuesday. 

For all of his years of public service, whenever the GOP held firm on an evil position, it was Joe leading the way in making the Democrats compromise.

But you can't ""compromise"" with evil. And some issues are black and white. And by compromising again and again with the GOP, we've now reached a place when there are now *establishment Republicans* supporting Harris for president, FFS. That's how indistinguishable the Democratic party has become from what the Republican party *used to be* (not MAGA, of course).

Now, don't get me wrong, Harris is better than Trump as president. There can be no question of that. No sane rational argument in Trump's favor can be made.

But the same billionaires who took Biden from last place to the presidency in less than a week also chose Harris within 24 hours of Biden stepping down. No primaries, no debates, no brokered convention. We got no choice in picking from a field of Democratic hopefuls...ALL of them more popular than Harris (who had dropped out in 2016 before last place Joe).

Unfortunately, though I like the guy and he's made some amends here as VP under Obama and as President for the past four years, Joe's been a huge part of that corruption of Democratic ideals for the overwhelming majority of this public service. 

And, as the 1% took control of both political parties in the USA over the past 50 years, Joe was there, compromising with evil, every step of the way.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"I get why Obama tried for bipartisanship. We are a democracy, and democracy requires compromise. The mistake he made was not having a Plan B for when the GOP stabbed him in the back. For instance, when it became clear that the American Restoration and Recovery Act was going to get almost no GOP votes after weeks of negotiations, the Democrats should have torpedoed their own bill and passed a more liberal one. In terms of the ACA, Democrats should have lowered the filibuster threshold to keep the public option; if the public option that covers everyone and everything passes, no one’s health care is disrupted, and people caught in the recession would feel that much less pressure to find a job, since they would have known that their health and that of their family would have been okay. It would have opened up a can of worms, but the filibuster is why people think government doesn’t work and that nothing changes; it would also encourage voters to turn out to protect us from going backwards. 

The Biden administration seemed to have learned from those mistakes. They tried negotiation for the American Rescue Plan, but when it became clear that was going to come up short, they passed a better bill. I was fine with Biden negotiating infrastructure on a bipartisan basis, as he’d promised to do so with there still being independents out there who, for reasons passing understanding, value bipartisanship over the quality of a bill. Then the Democrats didn’t even bother reaching out to Republicans to pass the Inflation Reduction Act. It would have been larger had Manchin not insisted that it would be fully paid for, which is fine; Kyrsten Sinema’s insistence on not taxing the rich basically killed the chance of it being a bigger bill. She even killed a provision to further tax hedge funds. I doubt that Harris would try to be bipartisan, just based on what the Democrats tried when they had a 50-50 split in the Senate.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Romney was about as bad as GWB was, and I’m not claiming that every single Republican we’ve ever had has been as bad as Trump was. However, they have all become progressively worse and more overtly fascist over the years until we hit the natural endpoint of the decades of neoconservativism. 

The argument here is “every election has been the most consequential election on record” not “is anyone worse than Trump?”

By a 16-point margin, likely Iowa voters prefer a Democrat over a Republican in the 1st District, where Democrat Christina Bohannan and Republican U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks are competing.

If Iowa is as close as Selzer says it is without any investment from Kamala, just imagine how much better it could be if we had resources poured in here. 

In 2026, both our governor and senate seat are back on the ballot. 

My personal prediction as a 32 year life long Iowan resident is that trump will win by 2-3% this year and Kamala will likely win the election as a whole by a moderate landslide. 

After, I think you’re going to be hearing a lot about Iowa having the best chance for flipping a senate seat and governors house in the nation and we will be in the news quite a bit leading up to 26. People are so fucking sick of how much republicans have fucked our state since 2010.

"That's not a fraudulent act in her mother's name.  It might be considered fraud in her own name, but I personally don't think that's likely to be charged.  I think they will mostly try to avoid creating any type of precedent that might punish a witness for providing their own signature along with avoiding potentially muddying the case to the jury.

If they didn't have other charges, maybe, but since it's voting-related, there's a pretty big First Amendment area that's protected when providing your own... I'm not quite sure what it would be called off the top of my head.  Similar to testimony, but not related to a trial.  Your own personal opinion?  Official support of something?  We'll at least say an official statement related to voting in some manner.

Anyway, you have the right to be truthfully and honestly wrong in many cases.  There's a possibility that precedent already exists for somewhat similar situations and might make it more complicated for a jury to cleanly convict on the unquestionably fraudulent acts.

Edit: Or, if I were to empathize, her mom did recently die, so she's probably grieving and not making entirely rational decisions.  Signing her name as a witness on her mom's ballot might be part of her grieving process and isn't, by itself, wrong.  She crossed the line by forging her mom's signature (repeatedly) and submitting her ballot.

I could absolutely see a defense lawyer using that.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Couldn't agree more. I'm pretty sure KH would be as annoyed as you if she read these comments. Honestly a large percentage of me thinks it's not real democrats - just Russians and Iranians spreading the hate.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
"How can you build bridges with a party that keeps blowing them up and burying you in the rubble. Republicans created this toxic environment, it's up to them to fix it. Democrats have been trying for 30+ years since Newt Gingrich blew things up. Democrats are tired of the BS. When Republicans decide that fascism is a bad thing, then we can talk.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

I've been to DC itself, it's a great city and it was sad to see. The US is a beautiful and amazing country. I love the touristy areas of America I've been to (I've visited 4 times), and almost all Americans have always been so kind to me and my family. But you guys on both sides don't seem to understand we all see your country breaking up.
Now, that obviously cannot happen. So you're gonna have to be friends again. And that will take Democrats and Republicans actually being kind. KH has been kind of Republicans. So why can't other democrats? If your leader can do it, so can you? Look what happens to Hilary ""the deplorables"" incident lost her the election. And online aggression does count. It is the driving force of extremist republicanism. 
Don't dismiss the power of the internet. I'm old enough to remember a time when the internet didn't really exist and neither did extremist groups because they had no loud voice. Now they have a voice and they easily manipulate people.  Social media caused the insurrection because it allowed bad actors - extremist Americans, Russians, Iranians to appeal to people to go to DC that day. Without social media, Trump could have been on every news channel in the US and still only get a handful of followers to turn up.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"No. No it isn't. Democrats have been reasonable for 30+ years while the Republicans have become increasingly insane and violent. If at this point you can look yourself in the mirror and call yourself a Republican then you must support what they've become. Until people rise up on mass and vote the current Republican party to the political wilderness right across the board (nationally, state-wide, locally), there's no hope for the party as it is. It needs to be torn down to the ground, the rotten roots dug out and tossed aside, and then rebuilt from the ground up by rational, real conservatives if such a thing still exists.

*****
> At the tail end of an arduous, hotly contested presidential election campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris managed to have the last laugh.

> The sketch, which focused on dueling rallies by Harris and former President Trump, offered a comic compendium of recent events from the trail, with references to Trump&#039;s appearance driving a garbage truck and President Biden&#039;s tendency to go off script in front of reporters.

> With her surprise visit Saturday to New York&#039;s 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Harris joined a roster of White House hopefuls who have appeared on the long-running sketch show, including her Republican opponent Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.

Hell, even the fun cameos that past Dems have made in TV shows. Michelle Obama’s appearance on iCarly, or Biden in the two episodes of Parks and Rec that he was in. Can you picture any prominent Republicans doing something like that? Although in fairness, I guess Newt Gingrich was in an episode of Parks and Rec too.

House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi pointed to Donald Trump‘s violent comments about shooting at journalists as evidence “of his cognitive degeneration” and doubted the former president’s ability to “last as president for four years with his brain deteriorating at the rate that it is.”

Pelosi was reacting to remarks Trump made at a Pennsylvania rally Sunday morning when he said that because of the way the rally was set up, if someone made an assassination attempt “to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much.”

"Your quote is accurate, but lacks who and what he wants to protect American women from.

What you've quoted came after he talked about how many women have been accosted/raped/murdered by the millions of illegal immigrants allowed to enter the US.

So it becomes a value proposition. How many rapes is too many? How many murders?

If there are no illegal immigrants, there is no illegal immigrant rape/murder. 

For perspective, an American citizen can't enter Canada for a shopping visit if they have had a DUI in the past.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Yeah the betting market stories are dumb because 
1. The betting markets are stupid the fact people are betting on elections is kinda pathetic 

2. These stories are not honest about the betting markets. When Joe Biden was elected president I put money into the betting markets after the election was over but before inauguration and made money because these markets had not resolved to 100% for Joe Biden.

That’s to say these markets are 100% not rational and biased towards right leaning candidates",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Secondly, your vote carries tremendous power at the local level. Do you see those statewide ballot measures? How about your individual city or county issues? Those receive comparatively few votes, so your vote has quite a bit of weight. You and your opinion MATTER.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"BINGO.

Adding to your point, most undecided voters are essentially “lurkers” when it comes to politics. 

They don’t have enough bandwidth or care to do any meaningful research, but they still want to participate. As a result, they rely on co-workers, family members, celebrity endorsements, podcasts, social accounts, viral clips, memes, etc. to feed them the info. 

It’s the double-edged sword of democracy I suppose (i.e. an uninformed vote weighs as much as a well-researched one).",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Honestly, as a man who is very liberal and considers himself a kind person, I hope more women can realize the power they have over men. Ultimatums and strong, unwavering stances that contradict the conservative outlook are often best served by the person who is most intimate with them. My partner lets me have it all the time and I feel the same way she does about everything. Men need reminders. We are pretty dumb.

I strongly feel that if a woman is with a man who plans to vote against her wellbeing, happiness, and autonomy the response should absolutely be proportional. I will never understand how men can look at what the right is planning and not realize how little desire women are going to have to be with them. 

Frankly speaking, and specifically in the realm hetero-centric thought processes, a man has a few primary motivators in life. Career, hobbies, and sex.   Sex is hands down the most potent for obvious reasons (sex rules). This simple fact has been so under-discussed and it makes me crazy. 

The answer to me is plain: If his vote turns you off, don’t be giving him any. Most importantly, tell him why and then tell him how he can turn the faucet back on. 

Spell it out and be strong. Men are weaker than you think. We (proverbial we) don’t tend to actually believe in the things we feel “strongly” about. Men typically bitch about things like iMmIGratiOn, tAXeS, and tHe DeMs because we (proverbial we) don’t actually have any real, substantive problems. GIVE THEM A DIRECT PROBLEM and watch the fake ones melt before your very eyes. 

A Tactical suggestion for a woman who is with a man who they suspect is planning on voting for trump (an existing intimate relationship an obvious prerequisite): 

Bring up their favorite sexual act out of the blue. Really peak their excitement. Ask them if they would like to do said sexual activity. When they reply with an obligatory “YES”, say “Cool. That’s great. If you would ever like to do that activity again, you won’t vote against my rights on Tuesday. I will know if you’re lying. The choice is yours to make, big guy.” 

Men have been swimming in the fuck around phase since 2016. It’s high time they “find out” that the women in their lives matter more than what some cheap, algorithm-based propaganda has to say.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"I was definitely in the camp of being cautiously optimistic for a Kamala win, but this poll kind of pushes me to the point of being actually confident. This seriously appears to be the only pollster who knows what the hell they’re doing. I think this poll’s biggest miss was Iowa’s last gubernatorial race, where it predicted a 2 point win by the Democrat, but the Republican won by 2 or 3. So even if it’s off by this poll’s largest error to date, you’re still looking at a one or two point win by Trump - which is pretty much a 8 or 9 point swing from the last two presidential elections. Wisconsin and Iowa are very similar demographically, and I think if there’s that big a swing in Iowa towards the Democratic candidate, that will probably translate to Wisconsin as well. And since Biden won WI by 20k votes in 2020, a swing like that would basically mean Wisconsin goes to Kamala by a pretty huge margin. At that point, you have to wonder how many more states will experience a similar swing in voting towards Harris? All of this is to say, I think this was the number I needed to see most to somewhat confidently say that Harris is going to supremely trounce this fascist motherfucker.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

I think this is going to be the narrative throughout the country and something other pollsters are missing. Older women are PISSED that rights they fought long and hard far are being stripped away and their daughters and granddaughters are now worse off than they were.  Selzer is a top pollster for a reason.  She knows her state extremely well and doesn’t use all sorts of statistical maneuvering to try and force a result.  Everyone thought her poll of Trump winning Iowa was an outlier in 2016 because most pollsters was giving Clinton a 90%+ chance to win.    She saw the shifts in the Midwest that others didn’t see.  And I suspect she’s seeing the reverse now.  Trump is a known commodity.  He’s not the change candidate he was in 2016.   It would not shock me in the least if Harris wins Iowa.,2024_11_04,06_23_09

"There are major differences in the reputation between those 2 pollsters. I am as confident as I’ve ever been. 

Vote. Every single vote we can use to tell Donald Trump to fuck right off to jail, is worth it. 

At this point in my life, I could honestly die pretty happy just seeing this one man get completely blown out in the election and put in prison for the rest of his life. That’s all I need. I need to see some signs of justice and karma. I need to see some consequences to have any faith that America can withstand future attacks on our democracy. 

You want to call it TDS? That’s fine. I’ve lost family members in multiple ways to this fucker. 

I lost an uncle to Covid after Trump downplayed and lied about it and created a massive divide in our country. He is at least partially responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths. A large portion of the population became anti-vaxxers and anti maskers due to his horrible handling of the pandemic. To this day, that is still the worst thing he’s ever done IMO and I will never forgive him for that.

I lost a brother to the Qanon rabbit hole. He’s in deep and I can’t even have a conversation with him without some deep state democrat sacrificing babies to use their blood to slow the aging process being brought up. He tried to convince my  elderly parents that the vaccine was being used as population control and it would kill them. Every single time one of his “alternative news” predictions doesn’t come true, he just moves on to the next one and doesn’t acknowledge he was wrong or apologize for spreading misinformation.

"Selzer uses call lists based on phone# registered (usually billing) address.  The only thing they use voter registration rolls for is party identification weighting.  They ask in the poll if you’re registered or not and what your likelihood of voting is (may, plan to, definitely will vote or not vote, anyone responding they’ve already voted get lumped in with the definitely will vote group).  Their “likely voter” screen is simply those who say they definitely will vote or already have voted.  They don’t do anything fancy to estimate who’s likely to vote beyond that (some other polls do to reduce the number of calls they have to make).",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Highlights from the Madison Square Garden rally include:

A disparaging joke about welcoming Latinos into the U.S. “with open arms” while making a shooing motion.

Disparaged Latinos with a crass joke about making babies and illegal immigration

Quipped that Puerto Rico is “a floating island of garbage

Said that Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce “might be the next O.J. Simpson,” referring to the football star who was accused and later acquitted of murdering his ex-wife. Kelce is in a relationship with pop singer Taylor Swift, who earlier this year said she would vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.

“The whole party — a bunch of degenerates,” he added. “Jew-haters and lowlifes, every one of them.” (talking about Democratic party)

Giuliani, a former personal lawyer to Trump, falsely claimed that Harris was ""on the side of the terrorists"" in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Multiple speakers also insulted Harris, with private equity fund manager Grant Cardone calling her a ""fake."" ""Her and her pimp handlers will destroy our country,"" he said.

Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson later made fun of Harris’ mixed-race heritage. “It’s gonna be pretty hard [for Democrats] to look at us and say, ‘You know what? Kamala Harris, she got 85 million votes because she’s just so impressive. As the first Samoan-Malaysian low-IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president. It was just a groundswell of popular support.’”

Carlson then went beyond insults, nodding to the racist “great replacement theory” he has espoused in the past.

That sentiment was echoed later, when former Trump White House aide Stephen Miller told the crowd: “America is for Americans and Americans only.”

“Once I take office, the migrant invasion of our country ends and the restoration of our country begins,” trump told the crowd.

Trump also took the time to address a recent interview with Fox News, in which he had characterized “radical left lunatics” as “the enemy from within” and proposed using the military against them. “They’re smart and they’re vicious, and we have to defeat them,” he said. “And when I say, ‘the enemy from within,’ the other side goes crazy. Becomes a sound – ‘oh, how can he say’ – no, they’ve done very bad things to this country. They are indeed the enemy from within.”

Trump spoke repeatedly about his plans to halt illegal immigration and deport migrants he described as ""vicious and bloodthirsty criminals"" if he wins the Nov. 5 election.

""On day one I will launch the largest deportation program in American history,"" he said. ""I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered.""

Trump called Harris a ""very low IQ individual""

He vowed to ban sanctuary cities

And given that Trump the polls show trump lagging behind his 2020 numbers among white voters (he's winning 50-47, according to this recent WaPo poll: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/01/harris-trump-pennsylvania-post-poll/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/01/harris-trump-pennsylvania-post-poll/), but he won 57-42 in 2020), KH seems on track to more than reclaim that small difference in the latino vote.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

">North Carolina had already surpassed its early-voting record set in 2020, but the State Board of Elections announced Sunday that more than 4.2 million voters cast ballots at early in-person voting sites, with turnout in western counties hit by Hurricane Helene outpacing the rest of the state. (...)  
>  
>Four years ago, a record 3.63 million people voted at hundreds of sites in all 100 counties during the early-voting period. This year, the state exceeded that total by Thursday, days before the period ended, the board said.  
>  
>Including absentee voting, 4,465,548 voters — or 57% of the state’s 7.8 million registered voters — cast ballots in the general election as of Sunday morning, officials said, noting that turnout may be slightly higher because of a lag between when ballots are cast and when data is uploaded.

"I ran the numbers for how Independents leaned in 2020 against the current early voting numbers, and here’s what they came out with:

Arizona: With Republicans increasing their early voting share by 8 percentage points compared to 2020, this state might lean slightly towards Trump if 2020 independent trends hold.

Georgia: Independent voters leaned towards Biden in 2020. While early voting data does not show a significant party advantage here, if 2020 independent preferences hold, this could favor Harris.

Michigan: With early voting showing no significant shift in party advantage, if independents mirror 2020’s lean toward Biden, this could indicate an advantage for Harris.

Nevada: Republicans have boosted their early voting share by 4 points over 2020, suggesting a slight advantage for Trump if independents align similarly to 2020.

North Carolina: Independent voters were nearly split in 2020 with a slight lean towards Trump. With early voting still competitive, this could again lean towards Trump.

Pennsylvania: Democrats currently have an early voting lead, although Republicans have reduced the gap by 22 points compared to 2020. If independents trend like 2020, Harris might maintain an edge here.

Wisconsin: If early voting trends and 2020 independent preferences hold, Harris could retain an advantage here, as independents leaned towards Biden in 2020.

In summary, based solely on early voting patterns and assuming 2020 independent preferences are consistent:

Potential Trump Advantage: Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina

Potential Harris Advantage: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin

Harris: 299

Trump: 239",2024_11_04,06_23_09

That Iowa poll though is making me REALLY believe the recent analysis you refer to.,2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Where do you see them ?

Some things I only see on Reddit. Like Allred vs Cruz, national news doesn't really say Allred has a strong chance in Texas. 

North Carolina isn't spoken about much unless Harris goes there. 

Iowa's poll was spoken about. But with only 4 electoral votes I don't know if a win will shift the must-win state calculations. 

The biggest thing for iowa is if Harris upsets there, the Dems might start paying attention to the Iowa caucus again, since it was written off as white-people-stan last time.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"If this is remotely true, Trump gets blown out of the water.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Yep, Trump only won NC by 74k votes in 2020. It was the closest margin of any state he won. According to the article 4,465,548 votes have been cast so far. If the parent comment's numbers are accurate that 34% of those are R, that means approximately 1,518,286 are R votes. Only 1.6% of R voters out of that group have to defect to make up that 74k deficit. And that's not even factoring in independents.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Yep, it's absolutely true. Everyone that worked on his first campaign said they weren't anticipating winning. But then the bastard did, and found out he liked the power from the job. So he wanted to keep it up, and now he can't win shit when he wants to, it's so funny.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"He'll definitely get less votes, and Harris will get more than Biden did. The only people who support Trump are the same losers who did in 2020.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Well, it does kind of match the 2020 result given that the polls overestimated support for Biden, which was the highest turnout in a very long time. And insofar as it's a factor, it would seem to be far more of a factor now after the realignment. In 2016, the college educated crowd was much more split than it is today, for example, and the working class vote was also a bit more evenly shared.

Democrats' ability to outperform in 2018 and 2022 also point in favor of the hypothesis, since midterms tend to favor the party that best appeals to low-propensity voters.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Of course now we're also going to have to start worrying about Vance in 2028, since there's clearly a large market for the sort of politics he's peddling. A really bad loss on Tuesday may avert that, but I'm not counting on it.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Don’t forget the brightly shining lone star state Republican Ted Cruz. lol,2024_11_04,06_23_09
"True. My point is just that in the highest turnout year, Trump did best relative to what the polls showed, and in lower turnout years he did worse. But it's only 4 data points, and it's certainly an imperfect fit.

Right now, the forecasts I've seen put the turnout somewhere between 2016 and 2020, so this may end up being a relatively moot point. I'm just terrified over here and trying to pass the time, ya know?",2024_11_04,06_23_09

Trump AI robot,2024_11_04,06_23_09
"IMO whether he gets another shot depends on how close this election is. 

If Kamala wins at 270, that'll be a clear signal that he still has winning potential. In the scenerio I expect he'll announce his campaign sometime within a month after the election, with rally's by the end of the year.

But if Trump loses by a rate higher than 2020 or near that level, we might see some mutinies. The most obvious IMO will be JD Vance, who will think he has a chance to carry the torch.  There will also be a few Trump offsprings and cousins that will run.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Yeah, JD Vance is actually one I worry about because he’s slick and has absolutely no moral compass and no principles. I’m hoping (a lot) that this election pretty much kills his future, but it probably won’t, sadly, he’ll have national name recognition.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Its a matter of perspective, though. He did best from a polling point of view, but he ultimately lost. When the turnout was low, he won. I think we might surpass 2020 totals when you look at early voting counts. That could just be people who normally vote on election day coming out early, which I'm sure to some degree it is, but we won't know that until after the election. I'm honestly pretty optimistic. Much more than in 2020.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

The author also assumes that the heavy penalties are enough of a deterrent... but how often are those people actually prosecuted. Michigan rejected 3,450 absentee ballots from dead voters. How many of them were prosecuted? In regards to poll watchers, the judge in Donald J Trump for President, Inc. v.  Degraffenreid ruled that ""State law does not require observers to 'meaningfully' oversee the process."" All it takes is a claim of ""feeling unsafe"" to eject poll watchers.

It’s why a loud, stupid, ugly buffoon with the physical prowess of a one legged, blind, deaf raccoon is an “alpha male” in their eyes.

"Yeah, I really don't know what to think.  I live in ""deep red"" WV, and when I moved here I didn't think the redness was really that sincere.  Now that I've been here a while, the culture is different from my first impressions, but along the same themes I expected.  Issue by issue, people aren't all that conservative in general.  They want better worker protections, to be able to unionize, etc.  When I talk to my neighbors about specific issues, they often articulate complaints and positions that are extremely consistent with DNC talking points.  Yet, if I go as far as asking about particular candidates, all logic and issue positions gets quickly tossed, and they are emotionally wedded to the GOP and Trump.  I still struggle to really understand why, and I'm leaning toward just a lot of propaganda.  The TV commercials here are all about Democrats and government getting in the way and causing problems, but there's never any actual argument, it's just ""the democrats caused your problems, vote Republican to fix them.""  There is no acknowledgment at all that the only Democrats that have been significant in this state in the 21st century are Jim Justice and Joe Manchin, both now Republicans.  There is no acknowledgement that the GOP has been in control literally the whole time that things have been getting worse here.  Basically everyone around here agrees that the sexuality and gender stuff the state house is obsessed with is not something they agree with or want.  

However, there is a huge component of evangelical Christianity.  It's not quite an outright majority but it is huge here, and of course evangelical Christians for some reason completely unrelated to the Bible itself are absurdly passionate in their opposition to abortion, not that we have had any in this state for years anyway.  It's very puzzling to me.  

Anyway, early voting figures are showing that registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats by a fairly significant amount in early voting, but boy have we been showing up to vote.  The community facebook pages have daily questions about where and how to vote.  There was a significant line when I arrived to vote, and a lot more people arriving as I left.  There are a couple of Harris signs on the main road, although they are vastly outnumbered by Trump signs; in fact the total number of Harris lawn signs doesn't come close to the number giant Trump billboards and flags on display in yards in various kinds of neighborhoods including large well kept farms, trailer parks, and our handful of suburban developments.  

Meanwhile, there is some quiet opposition to a state program put in place to attract out of state remote workers like myself, but the program keeps paying people to move here from blue states... and we are bringing our values with us.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

If Iowa has moved left, PA is basically unwinnable.  Even if Trump only wins Iowa by 3 points, demographically this will turn into a 310+ electoral vote win for Kamala.

"It's actually likely to be a landslide, despite how close the polling has been. In part \*because\* of how close the polling has been. All the swing states are within the margin of error, so if there's any polling error one way or the other, then all the swing states could lean the same way and deliver a landslide.

For instance, if there's a large number of ""hidden Harris voters"" and most polls are underestimating her, then a few extra points across the board could see Harris sweep the swing states and blow it out. This Selzer poll opens the question of whether such an error might be big enough to see a few red states flip as well.

On the other hand, if the polls are underestimating Trump, then we could see him sweep the swing states and win in a landslide.

It's possible that the swing states will split and deliver a very close contest, but that would require the polling to have been very accurate, which is actually less likely. And a close contest like that favors Trump. Which is why getting out to vote is so important, as higher turnout generally favors Harris.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"It caused me to leave the state. Lot of people would like to leave but can’t for financial reasons, condo owners especially. With recent changes to their properties regulations for upkeep and repairs their HOA fees are astronomical rendering their homes un-sellable. Nobody is going to pay 500K for a condo and assume a 50k a year maintenance fee. It really IS grim and that reality is coming due sooner rather than later.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Lot of people don’t and are going without insurance. Mostly older people who have paid their homes off. Unfortunately those who have mortgages don’t have a choice pay or foreclosure. Now of course the insurance companies all say they pay fast and fair, and they probably do, to the board of directors. 

Do a quick google search for 60 minutes recent insurance reports, what you see will curl a bald man’s hair.

I waited in line for 2.5 hours. I haven’t ever had to wait for more than 10/15 min before this election. Every 4/5 people was a new first time voter. I’ve never seen so many early voters in my area. This older couple behind me were 50/60 years old. He told her he wouldn’t be waiting in line if it weren’t for her. She said okay then leave. It felt powerful.

Its an issue. I do kinda believe there should be vetted institutions that can present unbiased 'just the facts, ma'am' reporting and follow up reporting but the truth is they have become outmoded and lost the trust of the populace anyway.

So *finding* clear, unbiased, accurate reporting takes work. More work than just turning on Channel 2 used to be.

"How the Electoral College Was Nearly Abolished in 1970  
https://www.history.com/news/electoral-college-nearly-abolished-thurmond  
The House approved a constitutional amendment to dismantle the indirect voting system, but it was killed in the Senate by a filibuster.

Yet just a year later, the Senate bill that would have ended the Electoral College was dead in the water, ***filibustered by a cadre of Southern lawmakers*** intent on preserving the majority’s grip on electoral power in their states. Despite widespread bipartisan support for the amendment in both large and small states, ***the Senate came five votes shy*** of breaking the filibuster.

>""Republicans have to decide who do they serve: Donald Trump or the American people? Are they here to solve problems, or just weaponize problems for political purposes? Every day between now and November, the American people are going to know that the only reason the border is not secure is Donald Trump and his MAGA Republican friends."" - President BIden

>“The solution is that people don’t have to come to work to try to operate trains after they’ve had heart attacks and broken legs. But right now, where we are is caught between shutting down the economy and getting enough ***Republicans to join us*** in making sure that people have access to sick leave.” - Sen. Elizabeth Warren  

>“If you can’t do it by September, then you can’t do it by the middle of November, and you can’t do it by December, why the hell do you think you’re gonna get it done in January? There’s never any urgency around this place to get shit done.” - Sen. Jon Tester

>""One-hundred percent of our focus is on stopping this new administration. We're confronted with severe challenges from a new administration, and a narrow majority of Democrats in the House and a 50-50 Senate to turn America into a socialist country, and that's 100 percent of my focus."" - Moscow Mitch

>""What would a post-nuclear Senate look like? I assure you it would not be more efficient or more productive. I personally guarantee it."" - Moscow Mitch on ending the filibuster  

>“One thing! I want my Republican colleagues to give me one thing ― one! ― that I can go campaign on and say we did. One!

"That’s cool and all but this article makes a bunch of leaps in logic and attributes correlation to causation.

Example: article names Elizabeth Warren as having slave owner ancestors and that somehow attributed to her wealth.  While she has done a lot of other sketchy things to obtain wealth, being descendants of slave owners (if that’s even true) has literally zero to do with it.

From Wikipedia:  “Warren was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City on June 22, 1949.[14][15][16][17] She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (née Reed, 1912–1995), a homemaker,[18] and Donald Jones Herring (1911–1997), a U.S. Army flight instructor during World War II, both of whom were members of the evangelical branch of the Protestant Methodist Church.”

She did not grow up affluent nor did her parents make much money and it fact it seemed she was more towards struggling than affluent.  All her wealth came from her senate career in sketchy stock trading and other shady stuff - not being a descendent of slave owners.

"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/10/29/trump-election-loss-electoral-college-column-00185866  
>That dynamic has led to growing Democratic calls to abolish the Electoral College, even by the party’s vice presidential nominee Tim Walz. Republicans, meanwhile, seem to have become almost indifferent to their inability to win the popular vote — ***they’ve done it just once in the last eight elections*** — and content with the idea that they can win the presidency even if millions more voters wanted a different result.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"You’re stretching and making things up to fit a narrative, not a good argument.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"I'm confident that the US will never payout reparations for slavery. The argument won't go much farther than this.

Short Intro of the History: After the Civil War, freed slaves were supposed to get land and livestock. This land proposed was coastal swamp lands. President Andrew Johnson rescinded the offer to appeal to the Southern leaders. Thus freed slaves had little choice but to migrate or share crop under hostile conditions with little pay. Entering the era of Jim Crow, African Americans had little to no civil rights, despite being able to serve in both world wars. I think you know the rest.

It's not about who should or shouldn't feel guilty, it's about acknowledging the economic advancement of the nation through means of the business of slavery. White privilege exists across a spectrum for both domestic and foreign peoples. Black people couldn't advance (post slavery) in a nation not of their own choosing due to racism and discrimination based in policies and culture.

I feel you when you mention the frustration of paying for something you or your ancestors had no control of because that's the plight of african americans and our ancestry. Here's some perspective/questions:

1. Can we say that America would be what it is today without slavery? Would immigrants still have migrated here in the same numbers? 

2. Black people are still very much a minority, so paying into reparations wouldn't be the end of the world. Let's say money goes to families at a certain income level. Same social programs are ran today for the taxes you pay.

3. Last but not least, when do we start talking about the indigenous native americans and how they deserve more attention and resources?",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Taxes aren't a punishment. When used properly, it's meant to pay into welfare, infrastructure, education and anything beneficial to society as a whole that we pay for collectively. Not everything taxes pay for, you will benefit from directly. 

Once again, the problem did not end at emancipation. Many people still preyed on and profited off of the position that black (and brown/non white ethnicities) to get ahead. Even if unintentional and unaware. Everybody did not get to eat at the same table, and instead of sharing - people say ""no, that's mine!"" when they only got a seat because then people on the ground weren't afforded one. 


You don't care about justice, or maybe you are misinformed about where all your taxes go and how complex this issue goes in the United States.",2024_11_04,06_23_09
"Or maybe if you need a control to this anecdotal data to try to turn it into proper longitudinal data, it would be other wealthy people who aren’t elected officials, or other elected officials whose ancestors did not own slaves but were present here, or wealthy politicians whose families lost it all and then gained their fortune back in a different community, or politicians who came from an impoverished generation and/or without genealogical knowledge and then who made individual fortunes in their lifetimes and then got elected…I suppose I could blather on, but referencing yourself, someone without major wealth or an elected position is not relevant.

Edit: adding—or maybe it’s interesting instead to look within this set of wealthy politicians whose families owned slaves and assess their policies for helping the lower classes and black constituents gain wealth parity.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

I think shutting down the conversation to ""I didn't do it, my family didn't do it"" minimizes the issue to some one and done thing when it is far more complex than that.

"> Gibbs has spoken before about his frustration with Donald Trump’s decision to launch a trade war. Those tariffs all but guaranteed other countries would retaliate, targeting the country’s “soft underbelly.”

>“And what is that? That’s agriculture,” Gibbs insisted.

>To make matters worse, Gibbs argued, the administration then “raided our treasury and paid farmers the difference in hush money.” The Market Facilitation Program he’s referring to served as a backstop for farmers who saw the price of crops like soybeans plummet in response to the trade war. In all, the program cost $23 billion.

A man sharpens a razor and tests it on his thumb. He gazes at the moon, which is about to be bisected by a thin cloud. A young woman stares straight ahead as he brings the razor near her eye. A cut occurs to the cloud passing in front of the moon, and then to a close-up of the razor slicing open a calf's eye.

"Article:

Donald J. Trump, who sought to overturn his loss of the 2020 election, also joked that he didn’t mind if reporters were shot.

Former President Donald J. Trump told supporters on Sunday that he “shouldn’t have left” the White House at the end of his term during an end-of-campaign rally where he vented angrily about a spate of new public polls showing him losing ground to Vice President Kamala Harris and joked about reporters being shot at.

The former president also described Democrats as a “demonic” party at the rally, at an airport in Lititz, Pa., his first of three swing-state stops planned for his second to last day on the campaign trail. Mr. Trump’s voice was audibly hoarse and his speech sluggish as he made unfounded claims about election interference. He praised himself for ditching his prepared remarks, saying it meant the “truth” could come out.

“We had the best border, the safest border,” Mr. Trump said of his time in the White House. He said that the economy had been in good shape, before mentioning the chart he had been pointing to featuring immigration statistics when he was shot at during a rally in Butler, Pa., in July.

“It said we had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” he said.

“I shouldn’t have left, I mean, honestly,” Mr. Trump continued. He added, “We did so well, we had such a great—” and then cut himself off. He then immediately noted “so now, every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there.”

The remark echoed what Mr. Trump told some aides within days of his 2020 election loss: that he wasn’t going to leave the White House.

“I’m just not going to leave,” Mr. Trump told one aide. He told another, “We’re never leaving,” and added: “How can you leave when you won an election?”

Mr. Trump never conceded the race to Mr. Biden. And his denials that he had lost that election were issued by himself and a ring of mostly outside advisers and lawyers, who pushed every avenue possible to overturn President Biden’s victory. Those efforts culminated in an attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6, 2021, as Mr. Biden’s electoral college victory was being certified.

Hundreds of people have been charged in connection with that attack. Mr. Trump has been indicted in Georgia and by a federal special counsel in connection with his efforts to stay in power.

Mr. Trump also complained about a series of recent polls. His campaign had sent out a memo suggesting a Des Moines Register poll of Iowa showing Mr. Trump losing the state by four points and a new batch of New York Times/Siena College polls of battleground states were incorrect.

Mr. Trump, however, took the complaints to a different level. He spent nearly 20 minutes trying to instill doubts about the election, reviving a host of baseless claims of widespread fraud that he made in 2020.

He claimed that voter machines would be hacked, that elections needed to be called by 11 p.m. on Tuesday night and that efforts to extend polling hours to allow more people to vote — something his own party has pushed for in Pennsylvania — were tantamount to fraud.

Mr. Trump, while riffing, also pointed to the protective glass encasing him now at outdoor rallies since he survived the assassination attempt in Butler. “To get to me, somebody would have to shoot through fake news, and I don’t mind that much, ’cause, I don’t mind. I don’t mind,” he said, as some in the crowd laughed and howled.",2024_11_04,06_23_09

"Folks, it’s simple. You don’t need vaccines produced by the pharmaceutical industry. Because you can’t trust them. 

All you need is hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin produced by the pharmaceutical industry. Because you can’t trust doctors.

"If I recall correctly, that's not even a mainstream view among GOP voters, just the loudest ones. The Harris campaign should blast this until it's on every news network.

I wouldn't put it past them. They're only interested in making public health worse for everyone and they will try to both remove protections for pre existing conditions and make people sicker by blocking vaccines. Quite disgusting.,2024_11_04,06_23_09

"If you don’t want vaccines then don’t get them but don’t take them away from other people. This is the thing that drives me crazy about the Republican agenda.

The craziest thing is it was under his administration that the US helped develop the COVID vaccine in record speed.  It was probably his best accomplishment.  Now he wants to ban them all.  This is why he is an awful businessman and person.,2024_11_04,06_23_09

"He is so much weirder than he was in 2016. I mean obviously he wasn't a normal politician then, but the Republican Party organizational structure was a lot more intact and he had a higher proportion of remaining brain cells, so now and then he'd come out with something like ""I'm running against corruption and cronyism"" that sounded like a thing a normal politician would say.

"It's crazy to even consider that the President can unilaterally do all this.  We're talking about a party that has been attacking the FDA/etc for making regulatory decisions as an unelected body (of experts), and now they want to appoint RFK Jr. as an unelected overboss who kills millions by banning medical science?

"*Are you kidding me?*

Rabies and tetanus don’t give a shit how strong you are. And that’s just two.

"It’s another goal post move. They successfully destabilized faith In vaccines with large scale  brainwashing. The next logical step is banning vaccines to keep people too sick to protest or too worried about health/health costs to make waves for elites.
