">Epstein also shared photos from the “late 90s” of Trump surrounded by “topless young women” at Epstein’s home in Palm Beach, Florida, where the disgraced financier victimized dozens of underage girls alongside his friend Ghislaine Maxwell.

>“And in some of the pictures, they’re sitting in his lap,” Wolff said. “I mean, and, and then there’s one I especially remember where there’s a stain, a telltale stain and on the front of Trump’s pants, and the girls are pointing at him and laughing.”

>Wolff claimed the FBI discovered the photos in Epstein’s safe when the agency raided his home in 2019, but never released the images to the public. Wolff described the photographs when discussing how he used Epstein as a main source for his book Fire and Fury, which focused on the Trump White House.

>Wolff said that Epstein was afraid of Trump, believing that he was “capable of doing anything.”

So Trump's FBI had evidence of Trump during Trump's term in office and it never got released? At the very least, trim must've known they had this. Then Epstein decided to kill himself?",2024_11_02,05_26_36
">“His people fight each other and then have outsiders—he sort of poisons the well outside,” Epstein told Wolff. Epstein went on to paraphrase Trump’s candid statements about his former strategist Steve Bannon, former chief of staff Reince Preibus, and counselor Kellyanne Conway.

>“He will tell 10 people, ‘Bannon’s a scumbag’ and ‘Priebus is not doing a good job’ and ‘Kelly has a big mouth’—what do you think? ‘Jamie Dimon says that you’re a problem and I shouldn’t keep you. And I spoke to Carl Icahn. And Carl thinks I need a new spokesperson,’” Epstein said.

>“‘So Kelly\[anne\]—even though I hired Kellyanne’s husband—Kellyanne is just too much of a wildcard.’ And then he tells Bannon, ‘You know I really want to keep you, but Kellyanne hates you,’” Epstein continued.

" [Katie Johnson's full testimony of 2/11/16 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnib-OORRRo)

**Economic Impact**: Trump’s administration added $7.8 trillion to the national debt, more than any other president in a single term.

* he bankrupted like every business he was involved in and refused to pay people and only got away with it because he screwed them out of the money they needed to sue him, and the economy, his strategy is to get rid of protections that protect the people and the country and our way of life, our means to earn a living and live off the land and sea when that fails, He will continue screwing people because he can profit from it and get away with it, because people believe wrongfully, incorrectly believe that a short term gain, outweighs the long term consequence that the people the country and the planet will pay for. this list could be way longer. considering the election is very soon, it should be. a big one is, Harris may propose an assault weapon ban, but trump proposed to terminate the constitution, and all the rights laws and freedoms enshrined therein. reaffirming that trump is the one who in his own words intends to ""take the guns first, due process later"" not kamala harris. people still believe in Qanon, despite trump admitting that Qanon is crap, also his own words. and if it is crap, then why else? on a related note, they believe that he is uh, pro abortion, but if you believe his accuser, when she was tied up to a bed at 13, he ignored her request to use a condom, and threw cash in her face telling her to get an abortion. they believe that he is going to, uproot establishment, or deep state, he wants to install his own. he wants to replace the media with his own state media because fox wasn't loyal enough, despite editing his reaction to the Epstein question, and not telling him that he was live on air when he said ""we gotta kill families."" people believe that he is pro gun, that he is pro free speech, he already has infringed on both and doesn't hide that he intends to continue doing so if re-elected. its a lot easier to haggle and argue about whether he violated the constitutional rights, by passing red flag laws, then it is to argue that he didn't violate 1st amendment free speech with censorship on truth social, but what can't be disputed or argued is that on that same platform, he claimed to create for free speech, he used it to post a call to terminate the constitution, making him, truly unfit, and untrustworthy, to uphold the oath to defend the document that he is calling to terminate, that all military and government and police are all sworn to defend by force. so, no, he is not the bigger defender or the lesser evil when it comes to any rights or freedoms enshrined in the constitution. no, he will not defend the freedoms they think he will, poisoning the land, people, cutting off those in dire need and leaving alliances won't make us great. about that, they think he is against the communists, the communists put money in his chinese account when he left office his products are made in china and he intends to cut off aid to Ukraine while people waving soviet flags invade ukraine, he is not against the communists, he is in love with kim jung un, and thats not just softening relations, he is helping our adversary at our expense, literal expense, we pay more to properly dispose of unused expired rocket then we do to give them to people who need them to defend their homes and people and country. he promised to end the war? by cutting off urgently needed aid, which doesn't really end the war, or prevent it from spreading or leading to another one. it emboldens them and strengthens them instead of stopping them and setting a precedent.he added more to the national debt than bidenthey believe that he will be the end of false flags. he openly proposed false flags when he was president.he is not of God, he admitted he is not christian when he said you won't have to vote anymore if I win.he does not embody any of the values or teachings or obey any of the commandmentshe admitted to sexually assaulting a married woman. He lies constantly. He stole both health, home freedom and life with his actions, that killed americans, here in the homeland.and no, he is not the pro Israel ticket either, he said to blame the Jews if he loses the election.oh, forgot another one, drain the swamp? he put scott pruitt, a man who sued the EPA on behalf of big oil, for protecting the environment, and by extension, not just wildlife but us too, that guy to be in charge of the EPA. He put a woman who wants to defund public schools in charge of department of education.\^he did not drain the swamp, he installed and appointed swamp monsters and made it worse than ever before
* despite Qanon claiming he is secretly fighting pedophiles, he admitted that assertion is crap, he owned a teen beauty pageant and used owner status to look at the girls in the dressing room, his daughter ivanka said yeah he does that like she is used to it, and to top it off, he didn't just fly on the epstein plane and didn't just molest, but forcibly raped young girls, when they cried for him don't do it, and then to stop doing it despite her clear boundary and plea that he either don't penetrate her, stop penetrating her or use a condom, and he told her to ""get an abortion bitch"" so he isn't even really pro life, and if he went from saying the days of infringing on your 2nd amendment is over to saying take the guns first due process later, what makes you think he won't show his true colors on abortion after he wins a 2nd term?",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I've watched the whole campaign this year and what happened on January 6th, 2021. 
I can tell you that America is heading towards a very dangerous direction.

Do not let history repeat itself. 
We've all learned history in schools, and today, we have very good resources to learn more about it in various forms, whether through books and articles or professors complimentarily giving you information on podcasts and well made documentaries.

America is going more mad, more extreme, and it is going more barbaric. 
Most of the renowned Trump supporters are

 A: super rich  like Elon Musk, who can easily fascinate and suck up to Trump, and the government can't really affect their well-being, 

B: Pro-Israelis, who fail to recognize war crimes, decades of military occupation, decades of inhume blockade in Gaza, expansion of the West Bank Settlememts, and the brutality of their so called defense forses commited by Israeli government and its far right  leader Benjamin Netanyahu, 

C: a far-right extremist and a radical conservative with similar ideologies to those of Trump, politicians who are bored with democrats, find Trump funny and powerful but tend to neglect all the downsides of Trump, the risk of his policies, or how he performed during his presidency.

D: ordinary people who are under educated, who lack some information and knowledge, who lack some decent values that make us human and make us united, and who are misled by false media. 

I'm not saying there's zero flaw in democratic party. 
First of all, a lack of campaign strategies and Harris not being able to answer questions in articulate fashion in some interviews even though her careers and experiences in the field are qualified enough to be a president of the United States. 
Democrats are also getting more and more angry and sometimes stoop to low levels.

"I recall seeing a comment that Mara russia Lago has underground tunnels that extends across the similar nearby mansions that aren’t as well known. And it’s well known in the area that frequent hosts are from other countries. 

Another point between Trump - Epstein relationship that doesn’t get much traction is that Bibi Netanyahu is the Godfather to Ivanka and Jared Kushners children. Aka Bibi Netanyahu is the Godfather to Donald Trumps grandchildren. Epstein worked closely with Bibi and Trump in various ways. And if you go back in time the Epstein but mostly Gheline Maxwell & Maxwell ties with Soviet Russia near the late 80’s and after the fall  & rebuilding of the Russia government and industry in the 90’s to 2000’s. The Maxwell family was mostly known from their time in the UK although they were from Eastern Europe and changed name from Ján Ludvík Hyman Binyamin Hoch to Ian ‘Robert’ Maxwell. The head of the family, Robert Maxwell is known today as a fraudster but he held many prominent newspapers and mainstream media. Including the European MTV, MacMillan publishing, the Mirror, and in America the New York Daily, Sinclair media. In addition to the Pergamon Press which was a Russia friendly press and news. The family was involved with early computer programs and popular computer and video games, most notably Tetris. And in government with the computer program Promis. Like Trump, Putin, and Bibi, the Maxwell family did not have a sense of humor if anyone spoke out about them or even comedy skits about the family and was never too busy to try and shut them up via lawsuits and the Court.

They were one of the few people allowed to invest in Soviet Russia. An interesting time period and relationships to read about on Wikipedia. Crazy how those events especially late 80’s-late 90’s have shaped so much of what we’re dealing with today geopolitically. 

Know this sounds all tin foil hat nonsense but the ties and relationships are legit available for surface level Wikipedia with sources to match. Like most topics with Trump it seems so wild he’s been without consequence in the media and with his base. I wish I was good with words and story telling but I’m not. However I do hope someone or a group of folks that have a way with words and story telling in an appealing way with social media would pull some of these stories together and make it go viral.

""If you're okay with Trump being a rapist then there's nothing I can tell you that would make you second guess supporting him.""

He ended it by making a fantastic point.  His followers are trained to immediately disregard any story about him that's bad.  In the situation where it's highly credible that he did something wrong, they're further trained in whataboutism in comparing to Obama or Biden or Hillary, etc.

Acosta then granted Epstein and **any potential co-conspirators** immunity from federal prosecution, which shut down the rest of the FBI's investigation.

Acosta was shunned and fired, right?? Nope. He was appointed Secretary of Labor in Trump's cabinet in 2017, and served for 2 years, only resigning when Epstein was rearrested.

And which side do you think all of the gun nuts vote for, while proudly wearing 2A shirts...?

But of course Trump supporters will try to spin it as though Trump did the right thing, when the truth is that he was well aware of Epstein's crimes - Epstein literally recruited victims at Trump's home - and was perfectly fine with it all until the two had a falling out that was unrelated to the pedophilia of it all. 

My guess, and this is just speculation, is that after Trump put the police on Epstein, Epstein made it clear to Trump that he had sufficient blackmail to destroy Trump, and Trump backed off.

"**""All MSM is conservative.""**

\^\^ THIS \^\^ 

Quite so.

All 'for profit' media has the same concerns that any private enterprise would have: they want to keep profits up. That means to keep costs down, like labor and benefits, and to avoid paying taxes. 

This is exactly what the Republican Party specializes in: advocacy for the rich and big corporations.

So in fact the ownership of for profit media always has an inherent bias toward Republican policies. 

Practicing journalism is their business model but the political bias of the ownership will generally be leaning toward conservative Republican or Libertarian policy. 

Freedom of the press includes the freedom to lie, and also the freedom to omit news without enduring coercion from the government. If the owners don't want a subject to be covered, it will not be covered.

For this reason I suggest everyone support Public Radio and Public Television while also checking in with the BBC for generally unbiased reporting of North American events.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"The sentence is ambiguous.  The full quote is kind of a run on sentence with bad syntax and you need to do a middle school sentence charting on it to really parse it... but there's not really any way that the sentence makes sense with the ""supporters are garbage"" interpretation.  

It's kind of absurd and the news articles are trying to debate the presence or absence of an apostrophe.  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bidens-response-to-garbage-joke-about-puerto-rico/

The actual quote: 
>The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter's — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American.

So, right wing media is trying to spin it as ""the white house doctored the transcript"" which is silly because, well, adding punctuation or tweaking spelling from a transcription is not ""doctoring"" it, it's just regular ""editing"" which is not nefarious.  

Break down the sentence though, and it starts to look similar to GWB's ""fool me twice.""  

If Biden did in fact say, phonetically, ""his supporters his demonization of latinos is unconscionable"" then how would you punctuate that sentence in transcription?  I suppose you could try to create a sentence break.  Let's hear the audio?  First report I found is obviously edited to make it sound worse... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lob7qk1hrRc (sorry to link to that trash site but not sure where else to get a video)... they simply mute the audio after the word ""supporters.""  

I'm now on a whole other thing... why the heck is it seemingly impossible to find the original video?  I'm going through dozens of links here trying to find it and basically everything is meta commentary.  I don't even know anymore with all these ""SEO algorithms"" how to find an ORIGINAL video and not secondary sources.  And of course to even see whether a video is edited or original I have to wait through 30+ seconds of ads.  I hate this universe.  Finally here is one, and yeah there is a little more of a pause than one might like between ""supporters"" and ""his demonization.""  

All the same, I think we are long past the point where calling Trump supporters ""garbage"" is something anyone has any business being offended by.  If you can call me an ""NPC"" because I have the audacity to... want a functional government?... then yes, I feel fine calling you garbage because you think racist jokes are okay.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"When my wife was pregnant the first time, we were vacationing in Montana and she miscarried at glacier national park. It was a terrible experience driving 90 miles to a hospital for “care”. The only thing I could think of was what are the abortion laws in Montana? Am I going to have to drive back to Minnesota so we can get the care we need if this miscarriage doesn’t go right? The PA that was the “doctor” in the ER didn’t seem to understand my question when I asked him what the abortion laws are in Montana. (This being a year after the fall of Roe) That was the scary part for me is knowing that some medical professionals hadn’t even begun to think about what the over throw of Roe could mean for them. 

Fast forward to her second pregnancy, my parents winter in Texas from Minnesota and we generally go down during Christmas time to spend 2 weeks with them. We kindly made it known that we would not be joining them as we will not be traveling to states that treat my wife as a second class citizen. 

I can’t imagine the feeling of hopelessness these women feel going to the hospital for help only to be turned away because you or the baby aren’t dead enough.

Edit: when I’ve told people this they often “call bullshit.” I want to point out that until you’ve seen teenagers screaming until it sounds like a noise humans can’t make because they’re actively miscarrying and we legally can’t do anything, you can’t say “no you didn’t.” It’s not one or two cases, we had dozens and dozens.

"This is literally what the GOP is working towards making national policy. The death of a woman due to complications during pregnancy should be equated to murder and GOP lawmakers should be held responsible. Policy that values the life of unborn fetuses over the lives of grown, adult women is utterly insane. An aspiring mother can, in most cases, always try and make another baby if, and ONLY if, she's not first killed by backwards thinking and draconian policy that serves no one. Rather than losing a fetus that could be no more than 9 months old, the right would rather someone who already has a life, known to many, and loved by dozens dies.

The GOP cannot claim any moral highground when they let women die like this. Not only that, they also don't give a *shit* about a child after it's born. They want to defund schools, ban books, and protect guns. They don't have to worry about the consequences of this because the rules they make for us don't apply to them. They'll happily let an abortion happen if it's convenient to them.

> But when her daughter got sick, Fails expected that doctors had an obligation to do everything in their power to stave off a potentially deadly emergency, even if that meant losing Lillian. In her view, they were more concerned with checking the fetal heartbeat than attending to Crain.

Anyone can look up the rate of maternal death in America, it's not zero. With modern medicine society has forgotten how dangerous childbirth is.

How much of a risk of dying should someone be forced to accept for a hypothetical child that doesn't even exist in the world yet? If infants were grown in artificial wombs nobody would be able to make a sound argument in favor of abortion. But they aren't, they're grown inside of women and the process of removing them is something that might kill or maim that woman. Abortion needs to be legal because fully grown adult woman have the right to determine what risks they are willing to subject their body to. 

On day one of an infant's life, you couldn't compel a woman to have something as simple as a goddamn blood test, even if doing it would save the life of her infant.

You can look up the ""SIRS Criteria"", but things like a HR above 90, fever, elevated white blood cells count, fast breathing, etc all contribute to this score. 


Basically anyone with a HR above 90 (which can actually be in the normal range) and a fever will ""screen positive for sepsis"".

"Maybe this is cynical of me but I'm somewhat surprised that Irish folks rallied so hard around the death of an immigrant woman because I'm sure the same kind of support would not be given in America with how xenophobic it has become.

The first three deaths reported on by Propublica were of Black and Latina women and I have to wonder if their deaths didn't matter to conservatives because the women were not White and they find a way to blame the victims. The two Black women died of complications after medication abortions for undesired pregnancies and they'd probably say that it was the medication's fault or the women's fault for not wanting their pregnancies. The Latina woman was an immigrant and half of America if not more hates immigrants right now. The most recent reported death was of a White woman, but as a teenager she was barely a woman and I wonder if some would think ""that's what she gets for having sex so young before marriage.""

There would need to be some sort of ""perfect victim"" for conservatives to care - a wealthy, married, middle-aged White woman who was already a mother and had a wanted pregnancy but died after being denied miscarriage care, and with a family who was willing to speak out and press politicians on the issue. The thing is, these women probably have a greater chance of actually getting needed care, as opposed to lower-income or younger women of color.

Trump's first wife, Ivana, claimed he violently pulled her hair out and raped her after getting hair plugs, because they hurt him too bad and she referred the doctor that did the procedure.

His lawyers at the time convinced her that marital rape wasn't a thing and she retracted her story.

But **in 2015, Michael Cohen was saying the same thing**:

You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone.

Both of her grandmas had their gallbladders removed, her mom had her gallbladder removed, and the pain she was having lined up with a gallbladder, but I had to beg and yell at them to check her gallbladder.  They reluctantly agreed, but only after threatening that our insurance probably wouldn't pay for the testing if it didn't turn out to be the gallbladder.

So they checked, and wouldn't you know it, they had to quickly get her into surgery to remove her gallbladder.  We ended up requesting the notes the doctor took and they sent them to us.  Before he went to check her gallbladder he'd noted that she was seeking attention, and he labeled her as a drug seeker.  

ER doctors have consistently been some of the shittiest doctors I've ever encountered.  They don't seem to give a shit about what you are telling them is going on, and they have treated us like we are stupid idiots every time.

Of course they have a very narrow definition of rape...pretty much just a stranger jumping out of the bushes and attacking. They wouldn't see something like sexual pressure/coercion by an abusive husband or boyfriend as rape so women in those cases still have to have their ""consequences.""

A few years ago there was a breakdown of most watched TV shows per postcode matched against the way those areas voted, and the most watched shows which indicated a Republican voting area were reality TV shows about pregnant teen girls. Essentially the suffering of girls who get pregnant as entertainment is their most predictable indicator of an area voting Republican.

The suffering is the point. The deaths are the point. They don't care at all about kids, and have shown it in every other policy, every attempt to stand in the way of addressing school shootings, starving kids, etc.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

It is additionally complicated by factors like I have zero desire to ever kill anyone despite knowing it could happen out of necessity and being prepared as one can be. And worse still is I have basically no faith in ‘rule of law’ anymore.

\- Newt Gingrich is upset over a new ad that encourages women to vote secretly for Kamala Harris without telling their husbands. 

\- The ad features actress Julia Roberts emphasizing women's right to vote freely. 

\- Gingrich criticized the ad during a Fox News interview, calling it ""immoral"" and indicative of a corrupt Democratic Party. 

\- He accused Democrats of promoting dishonesty and moral decay in society, despite his own controversial past. 

\- The ad has sparked outrage among conservatives, highlighting the ongoing culture wars in the lead-up to the 2024 election.

And raping your wife wasn't a crime.

Also they couldn't have a bank account, get loans, or do much of anything without a man giving permission.  So yes they got married whether they liked it or not, whether they were a lesbian or not because there really was pretty much no other choice.

When Newt Gingrich became House speaker, he told his new members not to bring their families to Washington. Prior to his tenure, it was common for lawmakers from both parties—and their families—to spend time together outside of work hours. Card games, family events, steak dinners… they knew one another and *liked* one another on a personal level.

He wanted all that to end because it led to people working together and compromising with one another, which is the antithesis of his brand of politics. He wanted his members to *hate* the other side.

A line can easily be drawn from Newt Gingrich to those two cowards, John Boehner and Paul Ryan, both of whom could not even bring themselves to *use* the word compromise when they had the top House position. Boehner famously refused during an interview to say it, prompting the interviewer to notice and point out how absurd it was by pressing him as he uncomfortably tried to avoid the word.

These things matter. It all led to a breakdown of civility and respect for longstanding norms that kept our government functioning, and that led to the Republican Party opening the door to a tyrant when he came knocking. Oh, sure, Paul Ryan hates MAGA today (just this week I saw someone remembered he exists and asked him to comment), but that’s only because they torched his pathetic career and made a joke of him.

If a woman is doing anything other than learning how to serve a man they view that as invalid, because they see women as lesser beings who must serve them.

All these tradwife women are learning this lesson the hard way right now in real time. You could post a leopard eating face post every day of women who did the traditional ""tradwife"" shit on tik tok and is now like ""I can't believe he treated me like garbage"" like that's what the whole world view is about how could you not see that?

All this fear and info that’s been in the spotlight recently about just how recently women were still very much subject to their husbands has been eye opening. And I’m almost 40! 

It’s like intellectually I knew about all the progress women had in the 1900s - getting the right to vote, to divorce, own property, have credit cards, Roe v wade,… but like all kids, things that happened 20 years ago were ancient history. I was also very privileged to have extremely liberal parents - they were executive woodsy hippies, without the pot or free love. So I was relatively insulated from gender norms growing up, so I was never subjected to a lot of “women should be subservient” bullshit. Also I’m probably autistic so I was oblivious to a lot, socially. 

It’s wild to think I was 2yo when women got the right to their own credit cards. That when my parents got married mom *couldn’t* own property solely in her name. Divorce didn’t seem as big a deal because there were several in my great grandparents generation - you don’t fuck with the Irons family women.

You know it the other way because misogynist pastors only focus on submission of wives to husbands.

Im not saying that the Bible isn't also rife with misogyny.  Structuring a marriage with the husband as a symbolic Christ is a setup for failure and exploitation (of women).

Donald Trump: ""Well, I think it hurts Kamala a lot actually. Look, she's a deranged person, but the reason she couldn't stand me is that she always wanted to go to war with people. I don't want to go to war.
She wanted to go--she wanted to stay in Syria. I took them out. She wanted to stay in Iraq. I took them out. I mean, if we're up to her, we'd, we'd, be in 50 different countries.
She's a radical war hawk.
Let's put her with a rifle, standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. Okay? Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face? You know they're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, 'oh, gee, well, let's send, let's send, 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy!

The same thing with the Wash Post and LA Times non-endorsements of Harris.  He is trying to intimidate people to get his way.  Same thing with the elections.  He'll pull whatever maneuver he can to get the vote count go his way or have it discounted.

The guy is a criminal who uses his PR skills and wealth to get whatever he wants.  The sick thing about this is that people who have these skills usually don't use them to further criminal activity, but rather to hone their career objectives.   Throw in the fact that he has wealth, and now you have a real problem.  He's managed to completely corrupt a major political party and bend it to his knee.  And now he has 47% of the country believing in him.

Now there are tyrants throughout history who were criminals with these skills....Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin.  But they didn't start out with the wealth this a-hole has; however these guys did obtain it later by controlling the state to their own devices.  And in each case, look what happened.

">During a live interview that aired Friday on The New Yorker Radio Hour podcast, Cheney said, “I can’t explain why George W. Bush hasn’t spoken out, but I think it’s time, and I wish that he would.”

"Well, I don’t know, but apparently Bush Jr’s mama detested Trump so much she wouldn’t call herself a Republican anymore after Trump insulted her.  So I think Liz Cheney is right.  However, one of the few times I saw Trump get booed by a Republican audience was during the primary debates before the 2016 election when he rightfully brought up that Bush Jr, Dick Cheney and Colin Powell had lied about WMD in Iraq as a reason to invade.  Maybe Bush Jr doesn’t want Trump bringing that up again.  ( Yes, I know Dubya is not actually a junior, but I still detest the little bastard. Before I escaped from Texas I would almost vomit when driving by the George W. Bush Parkway exit.)",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"It is a complete shame.  Liz Cheney is the only really high level Republican fighting to return that party to some degree of sanity.

Your politics come first, but, for a moment, consider the people aligning themselves with that tengerine fuck. Kim Jong Un. Orban. Putin and Iran by proxy ffs.

To paraphrase, he basically said that if this election is truly as high-stakes as every claims, and this is the make or break moment for America’s preservation of democracy or descent into a faddist dictatorship, then why aren’t high profile republicans like George W or Romney endorsing Harris and campaigning for her? You would think that all “constitution-first” republicans would have endorsed Harris weeks ago.

I don’t recall the exact tenets but relatively speaking, still an early 2000 conservative’s wet dream.

I'm really surprised at all the hateful and ignorant comments about the Cheney and potential Bush endorsements.  It isn't about the Cheney's or Bushes being in line with Kamala politically nor influencing her policies.  It's the fact that Trump and the MAGA GOP are undemocratic and fascist.  Cheney's intent is to motivate the non-MAGA Republicans and right leaning independents to vote for the Democrats.  Despite their unpopularity with the left Cheney and Bush are still respected to some degree on the right.  These endorsements are not a negative for Kamala.,2024_11_02,05_26_36

Trump has worse intentions, but fortunately his incompetency kept him from doing a lot of the damage he wanted to do. Bush just let Cheney run the show and Cheney was evil and competent enough to actually enact evil policy. They collapsed the economy, had a massive homeland security lapse, wasted trillions on a war in Iraq for dicks own personal gain, and tanked our education system. That administration did a lot more long term damage to the country.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

He will put us into smaller groups and then demonize each group sequentially until this country is run solely by fear of his reprisal.  The terminology he uses is identical to how Kim Jong-Un runs North Korea. 

George Bush really needs to step up this time and say something before it's too late.  (And it may already be too late, considering the obvious intent to steal this election even if they lose.)",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"> Last week, KCRC-TV — a station in Redding — reported that other Reddit users searched ManCow2000’s post and comment histories and were able to identify him as Charles Pierce of Redding. The outlet also reported that users forwarded Pierce’s claims to the FBI.

I'm commenting only so that I remember later on to check the news for Charles Pierce of Redding; I'd like to see how this story develops.

Also as a fun bit of trivia and for me to better retain the name Charles Pierce of Redding, as an avid *Mystery Science Theater 3000* fan I recognize that he shares a name with Charles B. Pierce, who wrote, directed, and starred in *Boggy Creek II: And the Legend Continues*, in which he costarred with his son, Chuck Pierce, whose legal name I presume to be Charles Pierce, Jr., which further helps me to remember Charles Pierce of Redding.  I hear that the director Pierce was actually a decent independent filmmaker and that the original *Legend of Boggy Creek* was a good if low-budget monster movie, and I'm just now learning from IMDB that he was a contributing writer for *Sudden Impact*, but I'm hardly a cinephile and only know *Boggy Creek II* of Charles B. Pierce's work.

But for whatever interest you may or may not have derived from this, again, I only wrote this to help me remember the name Charles Pierce of Redding and to occasionally search the news from time to time if I don't happen to hear more of Charles Pierce of Redding.

Last time, I promise: Charles Pierce of Redding.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Sure.

It's a signal to noise issue.

According to The Heritage Foundation, a hyper right leaning conservative think tank on the forefront of voter fraud panic, [there have been about 1,600 cases of voter fraud since 1979.](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search) Those cases actually contain a bunch of stuff that isn't voter fraud or wouldn't be caught by ID checks, such as voter intimidation, ballot harvesting, and altering vote counts, but we'll assume that they are all voter fraud that would be caught with ID checks because that casts the broadest net here.

[154,600,000 people voted in the last presidential election alone.](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/2020-presidential-election-voting-report.html) Meaning that if *every single instance of voter fraud ever* happened in *just that single election,* the rate would be roughly 0.001% or one in every million votes or so is fraudulent.

[Comparatively, the number of people who lack sufficient photo ID to vote is about 10%.] (https://cdce.umd.edu/sites/cdce.umd.edu/files/pubs/Voter%20ID%202023%20survey%20Key%20Results%20Jan%202024%20(1).pdf) Why is it about 10%? Doesn't really matter. That's about one in every 10 eligible votes that you're throwing in the trash, in order to catch the roughly one in every *million* fraudulent votes. That's 100,000 eligible voters disenfranchised for every single fraudulent vote you cast. 

And remember, that's assuming that every instance of voter fraud in the last nearly half-century happened in *one single election.* When you extrapolate the data out across the actual timeframe, you find that voters commit fraud at about the same rate as people get *struck by lightning.*

Divided by the number of states, you can expect any given election in any given state to have some single digit instances of voter fraud each year based on population. Anecdotally, I've seen more people in the NC subreddits complain about ID related issues preventing them from voting than we would expect to see cases of voter fraud.

Voter ID at its core isn't a terrible idea, but in every state where it's pushed, they also make it far more difficult to obtain said ID. They'll set up one DMV for 750k people and then operate it two days out of the week during work hours. At the same time, they'll charge $30-$60 to get said ID.

This is actually why it terrifies me that Donald Trump is targeting low-propensity voters. It's exactly the demographic you'd target if you were planning to cheat.

Several more have implemented vote by mail more recently, and several states allow vote by mail under some circumstances.

It's safe and secure. No one had any issues with it until Trump started complaining about it. So I have to assume that's why you don't know about all that, you're only listening to Trump.

There's lots of reasons for vote by mail, unless you want to make it more difficult for people to vote because you assume it'll help your side. But that wasn't the assumption very long ago, vote by mail was championed by the GOP prior to 2020 because it made it much easier for seniors to vote. It's harder for them to get to the polls.

If some has examples of your signature/initial (like a shady landlord) it's pretty easy to get a ""good enough"" mark with a little practice.

I should add that this is exceedingly rare, and usually caught because most people who expect a ballot mailed will get a replacement and return it or try to vote in person, where they will find out that a ballot has already been returned in their name and then you begin the investigative process.  Under stricter scrutiny (which you simply cannot maintain normally and still get the work done in time without dozens of staff trained in graphology) these forgeries are usually pretty evident and that finding is presented to whatever elections board oversees your jurisdiction.

Presidential Campaigns are big data enterprises and I would not be surprised if the GOP already have their own massive database of signatures.

"That is not how federal removal procedure works. The PA judge didn't ""grant"" removal to federal court. 

Once a Notice of Removal is filed in federal court, the case is automatically removed as a procedural matter. Jurisdiction instantly transfers to the federal court. The federal court judge assigned to the case then has the inherent authority to accept jurisdiction or remand the case back to the state court it originated from.

This was a frivolous removal and that is absolutely clear given the federal court's unusually quick remand of jurisdiction.

Edit: to be clear, Musk was absolutely not required to attend Court because the removal filing stripped the state court of jurisdiction. He did not need to show up. But I am frustrated by the fact that absolutely zero journalists covering this story have properly explained the procedural mechanics of federal removal.

(Much like Trump)

The thing is: Nothing in the text provided in the article is suprising. Anyone who had been paying attention at the time could have said those things. Nothing said requires up close/insider knowledge.  The whole ""he pits everyone against each other"" thing was common knowledge before he even took office.

Both terms include children in the legal sense (non adults), but pedophilia specifically denotes interest in the common definition of children (prepubescent).

"> In a holding facility, where thousands of people are held during trial, nobody is making special note of who is in the news, it's just inmates and a faulty security camera isn't unheard of. 

See, this is just going too far the other way, now.

Epstein was a billionaire, and a major news story at the time, not some faceless nobody. 

It also wasn't ""a faulty security camera"" - his cellmate was transferred out and nobody was transferred in to replace him, two different security guards who should have each been checking on him every 30 minutes supposedly *both* fell asleep, failed to conduct the required checks for three hours straight and then falsified the records for that period, and *two* different security cameras covering his cell *both* malfunctioned, all on the same night.

To quote the extensively-cited account of the period on Wikipedia: 

> On July 23, 2019, Epstein was found injured and semiconscious at 1:30 a.m. on the floor of his cell, with marks around his neck.[305][306] His cellmate, former New York City police officer Nicholas Tartaglione, who was at the time awaiting trial for four counts of murder, was questioned about Epstein's condition. He denied having any knowledge of what happened. Correctional staff suspected attempted suicide, but did not rule out the possibility that it was staged or that he was assaulted by another inmate.[304][307][135][308][306] According to NBC News, two sources said that Epstein might have tried to hang himself, a third said the injuries were not serious and could have been staged, and a fourth source said that an assault by his cellmate had not been ruled out.[304] After that incident, he was placed on suicide watch.[305][309] Six days later, on July 29, 2019, Epstein was taken off suicide watch and placed in a special housing unit with another inmate.[305] Epstein's close associates said he was in ""good spirits"".[12]

> When Epstein was placed in the special housing unit, the jail informed the Justice Department that he would have a cellmate, and that a guard would look into the cell every thirty minutes. These procedures were not followed on the night of his death.[310][305][311] On August 9, 2019, Epstein's cellmate was transferred out, but no one took his place.[312] Later in the evening, contrary to the jail's normal procedure, Epstein was not checked every thirty minutes.[310][305][311] The two guards who were assigned to check his jail unit that night fell asleep and did not check on him for about three hours; the guards falsified related records.[305][313] Two cameras in front of Epstein's cell also malfunctioned that night.[15]

Cellmate abruptly transferred out, nobody else transferred in, two guards caught falsifying records covering the three-hour period when he died and later claiming they fell asleep and missed the whole thing, and two different security cameras covering the cell malfunctioning *all on the same evening*.

> His future was daily beatings and being raped until he's using a colostomy bag for life. Sex offenders get it the worst in prison

For *exactly* that reason sex offenders usually get put in special housing units (exactly as it said he was), and not in gen-pop.

There's no proof he didn't die of suicide, but there are certainly enough credibility-straining coincidences and *multiple* independent failures to at least consider it a highly suspicious death, and ignoring half those factors or making up lurid tales of ""inevitable"" prison rape is not in any way ""reality"".",2024_11_02,05_26_36

""As the audio clip circulates on the popular video app, Gen Z users are expressing their shock.

It’s been eight years since leaked audio from a conversation between Donald Trump and TV host Billy Bush made waves for the former president’s descriptions of kissing and grabbing women without their consent.

Now, young people are encountering the tape for the first time on TikTok, where users are sharing videos of their reactions and, in some cases, reaching large audiences.

Many first-time voters were young teens in 2016 when The Washington Post first reported the incident, in which the former president seemed to endorse sexual assault during a behind-the-scenes conversation on an “Access Hollywood” set when he didn’t realize his microphone was on. Despite widespread criticism of Trump’s comments at the time, he went on to win the 2016 presidential election, and the mainstream news cycle moved on.""",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Wait--you think that any man who squandered his enormous inheritance, has failed at every business he started, declared bankruptcy SIX times, has found multiple ways (jobs, universities, charities) to scam people who trusted him out of their money, has refused to pay employees and contractors who worked for him, who ran up the national debt, and left the U.S. economy much worse than he found it, with high unemployment and rising inflation that his successor then corrected, who bankrupted a *casino* for God's sake, and who cheats and lies as easily as he breathes would somehow improve or protect our economy? It's absolutely delusional to think that.

As someone who does theater and has lot of friends in the LGBT+ community, the choice was fairly clear. It didn’t hurt that while I grew up in a religious family (Catholic), religion was never something that I thought defined me. I also am mature enough to know the difference between belief and fact. Religious beliefs are just that, beliefs. No one religion has any more right to claim their beliefs to be true than anyone else. Whenever I hear people trying to push Christian ideology from the government, I always counter with something like “How would you feel if the Muslim community or Jewish communities were pushing their beliefs? If you were forced to give up bacon and go Kosher because a government official is Jewish. Or if your kids were forced to pray to Mecca in schools at designated times because of Muslim political leaders?” If any of those things were true, they’d be up in arms about it, but when Christians force their beliefs on others, somehow that’s ok. It doesn’t always work. Some of them see the hypocrisy, but most dismiss it because their beliefs are “true”. Regardless, my political opinions have always been my own. I don’t agree with everything the Democrats do, but their ideal world is much closer to my ideal world than the one being pushed by Republicans.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Where this actually matters is when it comes to systems of government - the idea that we need to protect against the ""tyranny of the majority"" is incorrect - most tyrannical governments are minority rule, and that system that allows for minority rule is why Trump ever took power in the first place.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

I don't know if it's the brains of young kids or what, but it just did not stick.  It didn't help that I was learning this in the late 90s/early 2000s.

I knew there were people that survived, the war was long, it rebuilt our economy in the States, we were late to enter, that it more or less ended with the bombing, as well as some dates and concepts mixed in here and there.

The rhetoric about immigrants voting en masse in national elections or benefiting widely from government services is a fabrication not based in reality.

Even my relatively moderate mom, who is pro choice, has fallen for this rhetoric.

I knew from the moment he came down the escalator and opened his mouth that Trump was spreading racist BS designed to hype voters up and validate their feelings about immigrants.  What I didn't expect was for those voters to not be able to see the parallels between their experience and that of WWI/WWII Germany: blame all of your problems on an ""out"" group and start down the path of taking away their rights while making an enemy of anyone that disagrees with you.  They don't seem to realize that it's an actual, real slippery slope (an argument I have always felt was weak) because the treatment didn't go from ""you're my neighbor"" to concentration camps overnight.

"Tariffs are a domestic sales tax. Not metaphorically, literally. They are charged to DOMESTIC importers, and are paid by DOMESTIC customers by the price of foreign goods simply going up to cover the import costs.

If China makes steel for $300 a ton and sells steel at $400 a ton or whatever, and you say ""There's a 200% tariff now"", they aren't just going to pay America several times more than their profit margin and lose money like idiots, lmao. They're going to either:

* 1) Not even offer it at all (lower supply in America = higher prices for Americans, if so. Basic supply and demand)

* or 2) They will sell it to US importers... for $400, just like to anyone else. The IMPORTERS than have to pay $800 to the government for tariff, so the importers will charge American contractor customers $1,200 per ton. 800 to reimburse them for the tariff, and 400 to reimburse them for having paid the Chinese for their steel. So the American consumers are the source of the $800",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"It wasn’t ineptness, not on its own. He did things out of spite and vanity and malice that may have been the worst part of it. 

- Withheld lifesaving equipment from blue states out of spite

- Seized PPE for his grifter friends to then profit off of

- Sent ventilators to Russia when we badly needed them

- Refused to wear a mask and encouraged others not to because Trump did not like the way they looked on him and messed up his hair and makeup. This one may be the worst because he turned it into a political loyalty test whether you masked and socially distanced even before we had a vaccine, when hospitals and morgues were still overflowing. 

He may have set back trust in medicine for generations by politicizing public health policy. Remember what he did to Fauci? He basically made half of America hate him as some sort of mad scientist trying to make women sterile and men impotent. Remember the tracking chips rumor? People still talk about that stuff.

"He withdrew American funding from the Wuhan lab, which led to severe degradation of it's proper handling protocols.

We were the reason there was a huge research effort there, because we KNEW it was going to be the source of a major SARS virus at some point. I remember reading a 2007 report (cdc, fbi, one of those 3 letter organizations) profiling the high-pandemic threat that viruses from that area had the potential to produce. 

Each president since Clinton, worked to build our national defenses against such a threat.

Trump dismantled nearly all of those protections in his first 2 years as president.

I equate him and his administration as THE SOLE CAUSE of the pandemic. If we'd have stayed the course with preparation and mitigation, we'd not have had a global pandemic.

"In addition to the response, which was at best criminally negligent, it's worth noting that if Trump isn't President, it's entirely possible there's no pandemic at all. In 2015, Obama created the National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, colloquially known as the ""Pandemic Response Team,"" in response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak. The team consisted of communicable disease experts and their goal was ""to be the smoke alarm"" for emerging epidemics. They had an office in Wuhan, historically a hotspot for communicable disease outbreaks (probably in large part due to its population density and prominent ""wet market"").

Trump, out of an apparent desire to undo everything Obama had done out of pure spite, tried to fire them almost immediately upon taking office. Upon learning he couldn't do that, he had his crony in charge of the NSC defund them to the point of having to eliminate the team in 2018.

Could an intact team dedicated to the task have prevented the disease from expanding as far as it did by working with the people in Wuhan? Impossible to say. Maybe not. But they could have absolutely gotten the ball rolling to getting us ahead of the curve on producing tests, which are crucial components to proven response techniques like track & trace. Start testing anyone with any unknown respiratory ailments and it's absolutely possible we get control of it right away.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"This isn't the easiest thing for me to share, but it is important enough to. People lost their FAMILY. My Dad died because he trusted Trump over his LOVED ONES. So, here we go:


**This BS Killed My Dad**

And sad and overwhelmed. All this made worse by this lingering feeling my mother is being cruel to be cruel because of her own mental health issues she refuses to get help for.

Covid took whatever little time he had left here. We didn't see eye to eye on politics, but he was still my Dad. He was hiding how sick he was on top of it, under some idea ""silence is protecting my daughter."" Ugh. Then I had to deal with nasty nurses towards the end. It's been a shit show really.

I was vaxxed so I wasn't scared to be with my Dad. I just hate that this ideology has taken the people we love from us.

Body and mind.

I tried so hard to nudge him towards getting vaccinated. I know it's not my fault and I did everything I could. My parents had me a bit older in life and despite our differences I cherished the time I had with him. Just so sad that politics of all things could have torn us apart over the years or made him think less of his children. My brother is also far left opposite of my father.

My Dad raised me to be honest and have integrity, to mean what I say and keep my word as best I can. It broke my heart to see him just go right along with a lying bully with no respect for women.

He called himself, ""Fiscally conservative, socially progressive"" as a kid. But FOX destroyed his rationality over the years and made him ripe for QAnon seed planting. I hope wherever he is, should we go somewhere (which I think we do) I hope he realizes what happened to him and drags the mf who killed him down to hell.

My Dad had an angry streak in life however I never saw him become so hateful until this MAGA nonsense. It was like they just knew what to poke to make people lose reason. He was a brilliant man and even he was not immune to the danger of party lines over everything.

> The denial, confusion and misinformation that was so characteristic of the pandemic response also made it more challenging for the public to remember what happened.

Trump told the public that the government was doing all it could, but the P.P.E. emergency was being managed by a handful of amateurs. “It was the number of people who show up to an after-school event, not to run the greatest crisis in a hundred years,” Kennedy said. “It was such a mismatch of personnel. It was one of the largest mobilization problems ever. It was so unbelievably colossal and gargantuan. The fact that they didn’t want to get any more people was so upsetting.”

Literally they outsourced the covid response to interns. LITERALLY.

>Kushner, he was told, was looking for young generalists who could work long hours for no pay.

The US was going to get slammed by the pandemic in spring 2020 no matter who was occupying the White House. Yes, it would have been better had there been someone not as inept as Trump (who reportedly ignored the Obama administration's ""Pandemic Playbook""), but it wouldn't have been a night vs. day difference.

Had America mustered an average response, they wouldn't have dragged down the world's average.  It's closer to 333,000 dead Americans.

This has been, and always will be why Republicans will never take COVID seriously, why they cleave desperately to every ridiculous conspiracy theory about the vaccine.

Presidents have always had very little impact on the economic condition of the country.  Even FDR with all his programs, could not get us out of the depression.  It was WW2 that did that.  Reagan oversaw a stock market crash in 1987 and there was nothing he could do.  The only good thing that came out of that was new rules to stop trading when the market slides a certain percentage.

We are still in recovery from COVID.  Biden has not control over the Federal Reserve which sets the borrowing rate.

"Weird?  In the context of the current political madness, I wouldn’t call it weird so much as frustrating.

MAGA didn’t need to forget cuz they thought it was a hoax and Trump handled everything perfectly anyway and it was all Biden’s fault, etc.

As for the rest of us, I think human’s just tend to fixate on whatever is in front of them in the moment.  We’ve had so much shit going on, Trump trials, wars in Ukraine and Gaza, hurricanes, election drama, Roe getting overruled, inflation… the list goes on and on.

But the pandemic really is an important piece of context for the economic impacts we’ve suffered.  Over the last 4 decades the GOP has done a fantastic job of selling the idea that they are fiscally responsible and Democrats are the ones frivolously spending our tax dollars and blowing up the budget and that Democratic policies are responsible for any economic woes.  Polls consistently demonstrate that a majority of voters trust the GOP more on economic policy, despite ample evidence that Democratic administrations have historically produced more stable and healthy economies than GOP ones.

So it’s super frustrating to deal with all of the attacks on the Biden admin over inflation that ignore the root causes of the problem and just lean on the established perception that Dems are bad at fiscal policy.  We had a pandemic.  Morgues were overflowing in big cities and bodies were being stored in refrigerated trucks.  States were issuing mandates for closing restaurants and bars and other non-essential public spaces and people were being forced to stay at home without income.  The government had the option of letting them starve, lose their homes, etc. or hand out free money to help them get through it.  We opted for the latter and there was a price to be paid for that.

Then we had Putin timing his invasion right after Biden took office and working to sabotage energy production and transport in western Europe.  And our lovely friends in OPEC seeing an opportunity to squeeze the west for more money.  So while we were facing the consequences of Covid we also had to deal with spiking energy costs.  Which in turn gave corporate America a perfect screen to profiteer with a bit of price gouging cuz everything was getting more expensive anyway.  All of which is conveniently Biden’s fault.  

And who denied that Covid was in the US until the proof was impossible to ignore because he didn’t want to rock the economic boat during an election?  Who encouraged his supporters to reject the advice and best practices with social distancing, avoiding large gatherings, wearing masks in public, and even taking the vaccine once it became available, thereby worsening and extending the impact of the pandemic?  Who hoarded critical medical supplies when they were desperately needed by largely blue population dense areas?  Not Biden, that’s who.

IMO the Biden/Harris campaign would have made a much more convincing case for continuing to entrust the Democratic party if they had leaned into the GOP attacks by openly embracing the significance of the inflation and turning it into an attack on Trump and his pandemic policies, arguing that the economic repercussions were unavoidable and that the administration made proverbial lemonade and managed to get us through the mess as quickly as possible.  I think hearing the admin validate the hardship instead of trying to deflect and avoid as much as possible would have been more reassuring to the voters who are primed to see Democrats as out of touch and prioritizing “sentimental” issues over pragmatic ones.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

It's because without an education, you're ""free"" to believe horrific things and ***never have to ""feel bad"" about it*** (provided you ONLY stick to talking to all the others who are in the exact same boat and on the exact same side you're on).

Said ""freedom"" to be willfully stupid, though, comes at a cost that they can't ever shut the fuck up about:

""Waaaah the awful things I say and believe are making me lose friends and even my girlfriend left me and all I did was spit truth constantly. It's their fault, THEY could have chosen to agree, but THEY chose not to"". Funny choice of words for someone who lost a bunch of friends, but who am I to chime in?

They really do have this strict belief that ""opinions = the first amendment = untouchable by law AND **societal pushback**"" and that expressing these opinions should then automatically make them shielded from a) the law (even if they actively use illicit expressions in a painfully obvious way) and b) ***people having a real problem with being associated with pieces of shit.***

It's unreal the amount of narcissism that just overflows from them. It's no wonder they love Trump so much, they all want to actively be him.

Morality, for as much as they claim CONSTANTLY that morality is the ONLY thing that drives them, is catastrophically vacant in just about every single one of them.

Then they bitch and moan once their feelings get hurt and they go so far with it that they have to be seen (**globally**) dumping out all the beer they bought with their money because they got butt hurt over a mere fucking LABEL.

And THEY want to call everyone ELSE the snowflakes? BRO, a **beer can label sent them rocket shipping to the god damn moon and back from white hot rage.** They were SO pissed that they saw the label online and *then* bought fucking 30-racks and *then* dumped it down the drain.

"I really don't get why the Trumpers are so freaked out by Harris. Like sure, she's a Democrat, but they are acting like the world will actually end if she wins. 

Granted, everyone else is terrified of Trump wins, but that's because he's fucking crazy and has openly stated he wants to end democracy. Like it's a very real scenario that democracy just dies.

If Harris wins she's just another in a long line of petty standard Democratic politicians. Nothing really changes. But because they've worked themselves into a frenzy by making up pure fiction about her they think she's as bad in their eyes as Trump is to the rest of us. I guess when the piece of shit you support really IS that bad, you've got to make the opposite side sound at least as scary. But like if you listen to Harris, nothing she says is scary. Again, standard political stuff. 

The stuff Trump says is actually insane. ""Mass deportations"", jailing people for their opinions, like this is stuff straight from Trump himself. It's not made up shit by Rachel Maddow, it's not some obscure left wing pundits just telling people this. Trump himself is saying it in front of crowds of people while being recorded. 

Project 2025 isn't some anonymous ""Q Anon"" making up rumors online. It's an official document, published where everyone can read it, from a huge well known Republican Think Tank, as actual policy they want to implement, with the authors being former Trump admin people who could actually return to power if Trump wins. 

So yeah, you could say plenty of Democrats are freaking the hell out too. But 1. The fears are well founded with practically daily reminders from the horse's mouth that he actually intends to make good on his threats. 2. None of us are behaving like Trumpers. They are assaulting people, vandalizing, stealing property (election signs), badgering people at early voting, lighting ballot boxes on fire, throwing out registered voters, threatening violence to Harris voters before, during, and after the election. Like it's not even close to the amount of absolute insane shit Trumpers are pulling. 

At the end of the day, I hope we all just quietly vote in large enough numbers to make it uncontestable. That is very clear who won to the point that it makes Trump's lawsuits and election shenanigans completely unfeasible.

There's almost zero chance he could sweep every state that he lost last time. And if he's enough trouble electorally to lose Florida, that makes his chances look even more grim elsewhere.

Anyway, back to my original point - if Harris wins FL, trump, knowing all of the above, will experience the granddaddy of all meltdowns - and hopefully an aneurysm.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Badly. Early covid it was hitting cities hard but they quickly adapted and implanted masks and social distancing. When the vaccine was released, democrat deaths plummeted but republican deaths did not. 

They still refuse the vaccine and they are still dying, we just don’t hear about as many due to them locking down their Facebook and hospitals aren’t overwhelmed. Most people have the vaccine, get tested, and take Paxlovid. But about 30 percent of republicans haven’t and still refuse to, which is about the same percentage of MAGAs. 

I have a friend who works at a hospital. She said they still see around a dozen unvaccinated covid patients a week. Around 20 or so die every month and it’s been consistent for years. Most of them boomers, some gen X, but nearly all of them unvaccinated and refuses Paxlovid because XYZ conspiracies. Oddly enough they still go to the hospital and demand treatment.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"This came up in another post recently. In the 7 swing states — covid deaths were about 90-100k per state*— except for Nevada was only 30k. While not everyone that died early on were older or in that no masks/no vaccinations camp, the back half was disproportionately the non-vax group. However, we need to account for the big impact was the black & Latino community. (Edit for clarification: who historically vote dem.)

With those considerations, by my estimates, I think you could conservatively say 60% of those dead voted for Trump.

Back in 2019, I think the projected death rate increase was only supposed to be about 10-15% over 10 years as Boomers got older and the proportion of the younger population became smaller.

The death rate has decreased slightly from 2020, but it's still going to be about 0.98% this year, and maybe 0.97% next year. That's an extra 400,000 deaths in 2024 and 2025 over 2019 even though I don't think the CDC will count those as excess deaths anymore.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Charles King resigned in disgrace and retired from seeking higher office thereafter until his death.

That said, she asks me my thoughts sometimes, I ask her hers, but I’d never tell her who to vote for or how. I know we both voted for Harris for Pres this year though - I don’t think either of us are Dems. We live in rural NC in a wildly red area and up until recently I was a registered Republican my entire life. 

I’ve seen first hand child birth and all the work involved and the fact that it’s not hard to suddenly lose your life in that instant (my wife had heavy bleeding after and required immediate emergency surgery).

54% of the early voters per NBC are women.   That's 35.051 million women voters so far.

If that is distributed evenly in all 50 states, that 87,628 votes per state.  That's enough to flip every swing state except Michigan, using the 2020 voting results.

Women and men equally deserve to choose the mix of career and childcare that is right for them and their families.  Republicans need to stop controlling everyone.


Edit:  I hate how people dismiss what is involved in rasing children or making a home.  This is critical for society to function and ""the party of family values"" completely devalues it in part because they see it has women's work that doesn't generate revenue.  See also: caring for the sick, disabled, and elderly",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Except leaving means having the means to rely on savings to pay for an initial payment on a new place to live. Be it rent or own. By yourself. 

It means being able to afford the expense of moving whatever stuff you have left. Having the stability for work to survive being in a place without the same safety net you just had.

As a Floridian, I’m not sure how much of an impact the Puerto Rican vote will have in my state - but I’m positive this is representative of other Puerto Ricans in other areas of the country and in states which are more in play and vital to the election outcome.

Pennsylvania has around 473,000 Puerto Rican residents, according to the Census Bureau’s 2022 American Community Survey.

"97% of respondents say they’ll vote.

Biden is estimated to have gotten 68% of Ricans in 2020. If we use the same turnout number (and it’s prob lower?) that’s about 694,000.

Going with the PR population of 1.2 million in Florida and we are looking at almost 990,000 voters. 

That’s a difference of 296,000 and that’s being conservative cause I think Hinchcliffes comments will drive more Rican turnout overall this time versus last time. 

Trump won Florida by ~372k votes in 2020. 

So this won’t close the gap entirely but it helps a lot.  And Of course polls have errors and the sample is small. Can’t actually assume that 97% will vote.

"[Fake video of Georgia voter fraud is Russian misinformation, US officials say](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/01/georgia-voter-fraud-video-fake-russia/75993122007/)


Friday’s disclosure follows the ODNI’s public attribution of three other fake videos in recent weeks to Russia. They included one falsely accusing Harris of paralyzing a teenage girl in a hit and run and another falsely accusing her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, of sexual abuse.

A third fake video made and circulated by Russia purported to show pro-Harris voters illegally ripping up Trump mail-in ballots in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, an ODNI official said.

“This Russian activity is part of Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans,” ODNI said. It was the latest of several election updates warning Americans of what it describes as “foreign malign influence operations.”

The Elon Musk factor
The video is the latest salvo in an intensifying Kremlin campaign to smear Vice President Harris and boost what intelligence officials say is Vladimir Putin’s preferred candidate, former President Donald Trump, in the waning days of the razor-close Nov. 5 election.

[Investigating Musk’s far-fetched claim about Democrats importing voters](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd5l0d3794o)


Since endorsing Donald Trump for president in July, Elon Musk - the owner of X - has posted about the US election hundreds of times, attracting more than four billion views.
BBC Verify, working with data firm Node XL, analysed all of his posts since then - over 8,000 - and searched for key words to track the election issues he has been posting about most to his 200 million followers.
Immigration and voting emerge as key themes with Mr Musk engaging with misinformation online about “illegal aliens” voting in this election.
He has also claimed repeatedly that Democrats have been “importing” immigrants who will vote for them in future elections.

Among the narratives being pushed in the community is one that has become a pet conspiracy theory of Musk’s. The SpaceX CEO has loudly and oftenmade the false claim that the Biden administration was “importing voters” in the form of “unvetted illegal immigrants”. In the last few days, a Musk-funded super Pac has been pushing a fake pro-Kamala Harris initiative called Project 2028. The initiative has posted fake pro-Harris ads and sent texts to voters that include claims that Harris will be opening the country’s borders and is pushing for undocumented immigrants to be able to vote. Non-citizens are not allowed to vote in the US, and there is no available evidence they are voting in droves as claimed. Users in the community are sharing videosthey say provides evidence that Democrats are “bussing” undocumented immigrants to cast votes in their favor.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Biden’s big fault as a candidate isn’t his age (although that did hamper him) but his boringness. He’s not flashy. He just works.

All I know is while his statement is ironic and a lot of bluster from a draft dodging coward this whole narrative has gotten out of hand, and it’s not necessary.

Instead he got off scott free and i got a no contact order from my chain of command.

We swung for the fence with trump, tried to change the rules to win, and tried to dig up enough shit to bury him.

"It's important, then, that we don't take pressure off the corporate organisations and news outlets that have enabled and even endorsed him and his fascist ideals. 

MCDONALD'S CORPORATE knew about Trumps photo op/campaign ad he used their branding for. There seems to be a lot of (likely guided) confusion around this saying only the franchise location knew. The facts show that MCDONALDS CORPORATE KNEW about it BEFORE he went there, and they welcomed the idea. I CONSIDER THIS AS MCDONALDS ENDORSING FASCISM IN AMERICA.

JEFF BEZOS BLOCKED an endorsement for Kamala in his paper THE WASHINGTON POST. He's owned this paper since 2013 and the paper has endorsed candidates for each presidential election since. Somehow, when there is a BLATANT FASCIST running for the side they don't usually endorse, BEZOS decides this time, somehow, it wasn't right not endorse the one who isn't running as a FASCIST. This came days after another one of BEZOS' companies BLUE ORIGIN met with the FASCIST TRUMP TEAM.

CNN is now owned by an apparent Trump supporter, but make no mistake, they are far from the only ones responsible for holding a double standard when it comes to covering this passed election. Each of the major mainstream news outlets have sanewashed the shit out of Trumps TERRORIST rhetoric. They called Biden old and feable before he dropped out, but seemed shy about doing the same when Trump became the only geriatric candidate still in the race. Not to mention, they've made obvious attempts to bury the worst of Trumps messaging and did their best to sell the lighter, more stupid shit Trump has done. They've done this to get clicks and money. They've been instrumental in TRUMPS TERRORISM because they know the tighter they can keep the race, the more they can make us worry about the future of our country, the more money they make. Instead of informing the public, they played with our sense of security for a point or 2 increase in profits.

There are plenty more examples, but these are some more recent and noteable ones off the top of my head.

My main point is **FUCK THESE GREEDY CORPORATE PIG FUCKERS. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU, OR ME, THE REST OF AMERICA, OR OUR CONSTITUTION.

Donald Trump might actually win on a platform of hating America and hating Americans while his buddies actively talk openly about what their plans to destroy country are...

Anyone who actually cares about the law is already convinced by the conviction that Trump is a criminal piece of shit unworthy of the presidency. The sentencing is immaterial to that group so I just don’t think a pre-election sentence motivates any additional people to vote against Trump. And the risk of motivating Trump supporters is super high, as is the risk for general violence perpetrated by Trump supporters. 

As for the sentence itself. Well if Trump loses and merchan knows as a matter of fact he won’t become president then it allows him to drop a harsher sentence without worrying about it being inconsequential or complicated due to it being a sitting president.

Pre-2020 election he was a narcissistic buffoon and i would tell family who voted for him that he is dangerous. And he was, i think his covid response caused the deaths of many of his supporters.

Post election proved he was dangerous. Jan 6 was when i truly pointed and said ""see?"" because we didn't yet find out that things even worse than Jan 6 occurred in the days leading up to it.

Somehow they watch the same thing i did and ultimately decided that he was qualified to be president again. My family is not full of the brightest people unfortunately.

Emphasis mine. What kind of firing line gives the victim their own rifle? If you’re being objective, it’s obvious that his point is that these politicians who call for war (what doesn’t even really apply to Cheney) could stand to see the reality of what they advocate for instead of sitting in comfort in DC.

"This exactly.  Some of the encouraging signs:

NC a few days ago 38% of voters had voted early.  More Republicans cast their ballots than Dems by a wide margin.  One pollster conducted a poll among ONLY those voters and it showed Harris up by 7%.  This means she is pulling Republicans and getting the majority of Independents.

Today:  1 in 8 women have said that they have kept their vote a secret from their husbands.  That’s a good sign.

New registrations among young women have far outpaced younger men.

Abortion Rights initiatives are on the ballot in several States, like 139 in Arizona and that is driving more women to the polls.

The Harris GOTV effort is the largest in the history of Presidential elections.  

Harris has more campaign offices in way more cities than Trump whose ground game is weak.

Biden’s policy has sucked. But at least Kamala, without having an impending election coming can put more pressure on Netanyahu for a ceasefire. At least she’s mentioned a ceasefire. 

If stein had a shot to win sure vote for her, but it’s either Trump or Kamala.

But yes when Trump makes the genocide situation even worse in Gaza and strips rights from every minority group in the US at least these young (often white, from a blue state and less affected) people will be able to pat themselves on the back and say “We did it! We beat Kamala! Now Palestine is safe!”

But seriously if you vote for stein and ur in a swing state or a “leans D/R” state don’t lie to us. You don’t give a damn about Palestine or anyone else but yourself. Cause ur making the work to help Palestine objectively more difficult even if its already difficult.

"For those who aren't aware, Putin's MO in Russia is to basically run alternative power blocs as puppets, not just in the political sphere but also socially. For instance the Russian Orthodox Church has for many decades been completely coopted by first the Soviet, and then the Russian state, with the current Patriarch being directly linked to the KGB when the archives briefly opened in the 90s. 

In terms of political parties though it is widely known that both the liberal and farther right opposition to Putin's party are sponsored by his own. Besides simply murdering off legitimate attempts to form opposition, one of the tools of rigging elections is to get lackey's to legally change their names to be the same as any one in the real opposition running, so that when you go to fill out a ballot you don't know who you're actually voting for. Like there will be 3 Mikhail Lidov's running, for the peace party, the liberal peace party, and the party of liberal peace, and only one of them is real. 

Nor is Russian electoral meddling, especially in foreign countries some new thing. In the Renaissance era, the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth was Russia's main adversary in Eastern Europe, both larger and more powerful at it's height. The Tsars however repeatedly exploited the Commonwealth's unanimity requirements for voting (cough cough EU), by simply buying off a few electors who would veto any proposed legislation or decision aimed at fighting Russia, or strengthening the state. The result was that the Commonwealth tore itself apart over time, and the lands were gobbled up by the surrounding Russian, Prussian, and Austrian autocracies. Let's not let the same fate happen to our American Commonwealth.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Anyone voting for the Green Party is a moron, at best.  I say that as someone who ranks environmentalism as my top voting issue.   You are literally throwing away your vote.   You **are going** to get candidate A or candidate B as President.   A logical person would look at those two candidates and see that they have very different viewpoints on environmentalism and climate change.  They are **not** the same.

Is it simply about feeling good about yourself that you voted for the ""best"" environmental candidate (putting aside that Stein is as phony a candidate as there is.)?  Even if the Greens put forward a great candidate, it's a worthless vote, or worse, a costly one if you would otherwise have voted Democrat.  But you do you.

If you need proof, just look at how zealously and comprehensively Trump got rid of any environmental protection put in by the Kenyan guy before him.   You don't have to wonder about Trump's stance on these issues--he talks the talk and walks the walk.   As flighty as he is about sticking with anything, he's positively steadfast when it comes to rolling back environmental protections.

"As a 2000 Nader voter, I have _opinions_ on this subject of third-party voting.

Let's talk president first. Let's say you just want to get your candidate/party to 5% of the vote to qualify for PECF minor-party status for funding for the next election. Cool! That's happened 14 times in US history, most recently in 1996 with Perot. **Every single one bombed** out the next election and the majority of them dissolved afterward. No third party has every leveraged the PECF into future success, because they didn't win any power and thus couldn't do anything, and thus had nothing to run on the next election.

Maybe you're aiming higher, you think you can outright win the EC as a third party (because SteinWare are actually claiming that). Third parties took 2nd place in both 1872 and 1912! It's not that big a lift, right? Those were **4-candidate splits** and the winner still had an outright majority.

I've just now typed and deleted about two paragraphs of how the FPP and EC mathematically lead to two parties and that any deviation from that is basically punished, but I realize that's appealing to the wrong level. Let's try this:

If someone thinks that the **President** is the person that has the power to effect all the progressive change that they desire, they are _morally inconsistent_ in the following way. They do not believe in fixed hierarchies. They do not believe in kings as the best method of governance. They (hopefully) recognize that unions, communities, and collectives are the best model for action, not top-down edicts. They cannot consistently reconcile that with a unitary executive. This is not their fault! There's a lot of evolutionary pressure for humans to respond to Authority in times of stress.

So why would a progressive _candidate_ be honestly targeting the executive position without a union, community, or collective backing? Why are they not building a foundation? Why is it that out of the 520,000 elected positions in the US, the Green party (ditto Libertarian) holds **180** of them? That is not a serious movement. That is a grift.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I hear people bandy about the 5% thing a lot so I did the math based on the turnout for the 2020 election. 5% of that would be 7.7 million people. There's no way on earth Stein would ever pull those kinds of numbers. I dug a little deeper and the most any Green candidate has ever pulled was a little over 1 million votes when Ralph Nader's giant ego handed the White House to Bush. I'll never forgive Nader for that because, as you mentioned, we could have started addressing the global warming crisis 24 years ago, and instead we got Captain Cowboy and the Oil Baron.

"The only reason she got elected to council in her last term was because her opponent was heavily backed by Amazon/Bezos.

That said our council is shit in general.  The two good things I saw her do

1. She was for keeping the head tax.  Basically Amazon through a hissy fit over some new taxes and threatened to bail on a lease in downtown's shiniest new building.  Most council members caved and voted to repeal/suspend the head tax that was directly voted into existence by the electorate, and then Amazon reneged on that lease *anyway*.  They used the threat of doing what they always intended to do to strong arm the council against the will of the city and those idiots got dumped by it.  Amazon then did the same thing on the national level with the HQ2 ""competition"".

2. She was on the protestors side during George Floyd, but like every community meeting she's ever been to, she would hog the mic and not give a voice or collaborate with the protestors on the ground setting the whole event up beyond things that directly benefitted her.

Also she lives on the east side, which is like someone from Jersey trying to get elected governor of Pennsylvania",2024_11_02,05_26_36

He wants Kyiv to capitulate because and only because if he stands up against Russia he believes it will get him shot. Even if he was trying to be threatening, that's not how it came across.

Second, this is a time where he desperately needs to convince outside voters that he is a capable leader. It is not a time to air grievances. Or try to settle grudges. This is yet another unforced error in the closing days of the campaign. And it is why he will lose.

For which I am very happy. As a conservative republican, I have grown tired of this idiot and his stupidity. He's a novelty act who got lucky in one election and has turned my beloved GOP into his cult of personality. It's long past time for him to go. Let him spend the rest of his days in Butner.

She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with 9 barrels shooting at her, okay? Let's see how she feels about it, y'know, when the guns are trained on *her* face. Y'know they're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying 'Aw gee will- Let's, uh, send uh- Let's send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy.'""

I dislike war-mongering pricks who send our friend and family to die, but I don’t suggest they should be thrown into the dirt with them and gunned down by terrorists in a war. Donald Trump clearly does.

Let’s take him at his word. He wants to put Liz Cheney in a war zone to prove a point. Are we accepting that? We’re gonna accept a US President being able to hand pick people to just get thrown into the military?

The fact of the matter is that Trump has begun to use this violent rhetoric more and more often.

"What doesn’t get discussed very often is the ultimate goal of ultra religious conservatives who installed Trump in 2016 for some conservative justices to overturn Roe.  

Project 2025 and the Heritage Foundation President have ties to Opus Dei.  Their vision for America is horrific.  

There is no doubt that conservatives’ hope is that Trump will get into office and he will either die of old age or get 25th’d.  And Vance will take the throne. In many ways, Vance is way worse than Trump. 

Deep down, these ultra religious conservatives who want to turn our country into a theocracy, despise Trump but he is a tool and a useful idiot.

In the video at the link below, Frank Schaefer, whose dad wrote the book, The Christian Manifesto, explains the history and roots of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society.  People should know that long after Trump is gone, these religious fascists will still be here.  Vote Democrat down the ballot.

Her father gets a lot of attention for the Iraq War, but Liz Cheney is not her father.

The corporatists and fundamentalists are going to fight for domination, as their visions for America cannot truly coincide. Fundies essentially want to remove women from the economy, and that would be devastating to corporate bottom lines. They also want babies to fuel their weird white fetishization, but too many babies becomes a burden on societal structures, an economic burden if-you-will. Especially when 1/2 those babies won't be allowed to work or independently own anything. 

To your point about Musk/Thiel, they want the US to undergo a collapse akin to the USSR, where much of the federation remains intact, but presents the opportunity to sell of government property at firesale prices. Bonus if there's a recession, so private property will be cheap as well.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Trump IS exactly like Hitler. That's not inciting anything, that's stating a basic fact. Inciting violence is when you say ""You should do X violent thing to Y person"". Not describing factual characteristics of a person and not suggesting anyone do anything.

Trump IS inciting violence though when he suggests that X violent thing (""being shot by nine barrels"") should happen to Y person (Liz Cheney)

His has INCITEMENT, and his has VIOLENCE. Mine has neither incitement nor violence. Not complicated.

------------

And to be crystal clear, no, nobody should do anything violent to Trump.

Comparing the two is completely accurate, because Trump almost exactly matches everything about Hitler's strategy and situation in the equivalent early part of his pre-dictatorship career and how he got into the dictatorship in the first place, where the mass killing only started from then on out.

The point of being on the lookout for early career comparisons is obviously to AVOID the millions of deaths BEFORE that part also matches up. If you don't notice until AFTER the millions of deaths, then your noticing was useless, duh",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Polls are polls, and every eligible voter, if they already haven't, should educate themselves on how to read polls, how to identify pollsters and their methodologies, their sampling methods, participant demographics, any inherent flaws and biases, the wording and structure of questions, whose funding them, the pollster's credibility, so on and so forth.

Also, this should go without saying, but a ""snap poll"" conducted by Elon Musk on Twitter, doesn't even fall into the category of a legitimate poll. Musk has carried out a few of these kinds of ""polls,"" while in one post he even had the audacity to call his Twitter poll ""super unscientific."" But that did not stop conservatives from taking it seriously, even sharing it across social media. This is a perfect example of poll *and* media illiteracy. 

That being said, I think the result of this race, which continues to be touted as one of the tightest in recent memory, will come down to one of two things, or both for that matter.

1. Who and how many registered/likely voters will choose to not show up to vote this election
2. Who and how many registered/likely voters will be disenfranchised this election. Or in other words, won't have a choice.

When it comes to the former, I think Harris will benefit from a greater percentage of never Trumpers, disillusioned former Trump voters, moderates and Haley supporters, and so called ""RINOs"" who are either put off by Trump and his downballot allies, or simply don't want to vote for the guy who the Republican party has made frontrunner three elections in a row.

I'm also of the opinion that there are quite a few potential voters who might not turn out for Trump, but will gladly or even half-heartedly tell pollsters that they would vote for him.

When it comes to number 2, Republicans across the country have been exploiting Trump's ""big lie"" for the past four years to sow distrust in our elections, granting themselves the opportunity (or excuse) to implement various voter suppression measures in battleground states. These are bills and measures that not only seek to excessively purge rolls, disqualify certain voters, throw out ballots and make the voting process more tedious, but they also afford Republicans more power, authority and supervision over our election system.

I'm talking about Republican state election officials with the unilateral power to contest or even deny the results of the election, with the power to implement last minute rule changes, the authority to throw out votes based on flimsy rationale or even said rule changes.

I'm talking about laws that make it easier for Republican state officials to cast doubt on the results and even claim fraud based on conjecture, phone in voter fraud hotlines, constituent's anecdotes, widespread election denying fervor, etc...

And I'm also talking about Republicans preparing to mount exhaustive legal battles if the results don't turn out as expected.

It's fucked up, but I think this election comes down to the difference between the number of potential Trump voters who choose not to show up to the polls, versus the number of potential Harris voters who don't have a choice in having their vote go uncounted.

And yes, it's unfortunate that this election and elections of the past have/will be decided by low propensity voters. That's the nature of the game, and I think it says a lot about how fragile our democracy can be.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

>**Socialism will be treated as a foreign combatant** which aims to destroy our prosperity and freedom.

>**Socialism is un-American**.

>Today’s **Democrat Party** is trying to rig elections and pack the courts because they have given up on Democracy.

>They don’t believe they can win based on their ideas, so they want to game the system and legalize voter fraud to stay in power. In true Orwellian fashion, **Democrats** refer to their election rigging plans as “voting rights”. We won’t allow the **radical left** to destroy our democracy by institutionalizing dishonesty and fraud.

>Among the things the **militant left** plan to change or destroy are American history, patriotism, border security, Christianity, the nuclear family, gender, traditional morality, capitalism, fiscal responsibility, opportunity, rugged individualism, the Judeo-Christian ethic, dissent, free speech, color blindness, law enforcement, religious liberty, and private ownership of firearms.

>**The Democrat Party and their Big Tech** allies are not merely secular; they have virtually created a new religion of wokeness that is increasingly hostile toward people of faith, particularly Christians and Jews. They are determined to drive all mention of God out of public view. We will not be silenced, canceled, or told what words to use by the politically correct crowd.

"I am 100% confident of a 0% chance of any *legitimate* Trump victory for the following reasons:    
     
- Trump already lost to Biden/Harris in 2020    
- Covid disproportionately killed Trump voters   
- Trump voters skew older and many have died since 2020    
- Millions of younger people are now eligible to vote - and they skew heavily toward Harris/Walz.
- Harris/Walz is a wildly more popular ticket than Biden/Harris was. Most 'double-haters' are now enthusiastic Harris/Walz supporters.        
- Trump's insurrection, being found liable for rape, and felony convictions have driven some Republicans to vote against him. They have not attracted new voters *to* Trump
- Dozens of former Trump Admin officials have denounced Trump - which they *hadn't* done in 2020  
- Many Republicans and independents who voted for Trump in 2020 are now voting for Harris     
- RFK Jr. and Jill Stein are stealing votes from Trump anywhere they are on the ballot - more than they are taking votes from Harris.   
- Almost nobody who voted for Biden in 2020 is now voting for Trump, who has not expanded his base. 
- The Madison Square Garden debacle has even further incited negative voter sentiment and backlash against the Trump ticket.  
  
A *legitimate* Trump win is a near mathematical impossibility.   
  
Note the heavy-lifting being done by the word *legitimate*.  
  
Trump and the GOP have been actively engaged in widespread, nationwide conspiracy to commit election fraud since 2020, virtually unopposed by Biden's Justice Department under Republican sympathizer Merrick Garland. 
  
The fraud is so pervasive as to potentially overcome even a substantial lead for Harris on election day. 
  
Republicans have already announced and published their plans to obstruct local elections, confuse the process, steal ballots, burn ballot drop boxes, introduce errors, cause interminable delays, once again send fake electors with fraudulent results, and lean on corrupt judges to make unlawful rulings in their favor. 
  
In fact, the widespread, open, numerous and flagrant acts of election interference, disruption, obstruction, and fraud being committed by Republican voters and officials is providing a massive amount of evidence Democrats can use to contest any claimed Trump victory. 
  
At this point, there is ample reason to absolutely reject any Republican claims of a Trump win next week. Republicans have provided a mountain of justification for believing any such outcome is purely the result of fraud.  
  
The Harris campaign, Biden Administration, and Biden's Justice Department (though fat chance on Merrick Garland doing jack-shit) need to strenuously oppose any claims of a Trump win, raising challenges based on VERY apparent election interference/fraud/obstruction by Republican operatives nationwide. And unlike the 63 cases Trump lost in courts across the country due to a complete lack of evidence, there is TONS of evidence of Republican-led fraud in THIS cycle.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Now I feel like there are a ton of reasons people could switch to him; perception that the economy is bad and he'll somehow magically fix it, racism, and misogyny are the top ones.

"I took the time yesterday to go through numerous polls [aggregated on 538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/), basically I wanted to see what was up with sample sizes and margins of error.

What I found was interesting. Almost every poll with a <3% spread between the candidates were within the margin of error, rendering the vast majority of polls useless for making statistical inferences. More interesting, I found very few polls favoring Trump that had more than n=2000, and all were within the margin of error. 

Now, where things get interesting, there was [a poll that had Harris winning by %,](https://sites.tufts.edu/cooperativeelectionstudy/2024/10/28/ces-estimates-on-the-2024-presidential-election/) that had a sample of 78,000 people. [You can play around with the data on a bar graph here](https://cooperativeelectionstudy.shinyapps.io/prez2024pre/). It's interesting to see, out of people who reported to have voted or will certainly vote, the numbers are even more heavily leaning towards Harris. 3% going from Biden2020 to Trump2024, but 4% Trump2020 going Harris2024. And undecided/did not vote going 51/42 Harris/Trump (again, out of respondents who said they have voted or certainly will). 

Take this all with the usual statistical grain of salt, but my goal here was to cut through the noise created by 1-3% margins that don't actually mean anything. PACs can pump out statistically meaningless polling, but they still will impact the aggregate (even when weighted; those polls should be entirely disregarded imo). When you go through and compare polls that have Trump winning and polls that have Harris winning, there's a clear divide in statistical reliability between the two. That CES survey is the largest poll you'll get, by the most non-partisan organization you'll get. And it gives Harris one of the largest margins of victory of all polling.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Pollsters are starting to release their real polls now. They didn’t want to earlier because they weren’t confident in their data sets. Because of the narrative you mentioned, which lead to herding. 

Harris was okay with this, because it pushed the ground game even harder. Complacency is a huge thing too. As a UK resident, I’m sure you can relate. 

Now we are getting more complete and complimentary data. So pullers are more confident moving the numbers over. The thing is, I see +6 and think they’re actually returning +10. Allred is a good example. He’s now 45-44. But the way Cruz has been talking for weeks, those are old numbers. I expect they’re returning +4 there. 

Another pollster said he can’t do focus groups properly anymore, because he cannot find Independent women. He also says, Harris has eaten into Trumps base with women too. He said what used to be “Likely Trump” are now Independent. 

Lots of silent types out there too. That’s why this whole secret ballots stuff is being pushed. “Will my husband know who I voted for” is exploding on Google right now. I’ve seen die hard Trump base say they’re voting for Harris because they have daughters. 

You’ll start to see more representative polls like this coming out ALL weekend. They’ll call a Harris win with all the swings. But Eday will be much bigger.

The best way to thwart that is if it’s not close. If Harris wins most of the swing states then Trump’s team has to figure out how to overthrow multiple states’ elections. That helped immensely in 2020 - they had to prove Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona were all stolen and that turned out to be too much.

I don't think that he gained supporters necessarily, just gained voters. Our country was way more politically activated in 2020 than in 2016. I didn't vote in 2016 (to my lifelong shame) but I did in 2020. The democrats didn't gain my support, I just got off my ass. I think lots of Republicans were in the same boat. People were hyped up on both sides and the numbers showed it.

I know it's anecdotal but I've seen much less enthusiasm on the right this cycle. Way less Trump signs. Way less Trump caravans. Way less red hats. Way less everything. What I've seen more of though is Harris signs. Groups of supporters on the side of the road waving Harris flags and handing out info.

Seeing Biden's ads about how we had the best economy every, while the majority of the non-stock owning class was getting poorer was rather tone deaf.

""Mackenzie Owens and her boyfriend strut toward the camera like models on a catwalk, posing as she takes a dramatic sip from her Stanley cup. “Just a bf and a gf going to cancel each other’s votes,” reads the caption of their TikTok – the couple, who live in Pennsylvania, support separate candidates this election season.

Owens made the TikTok to join in on a trend of women disclosing that they’re voting against their partners’ preferred candidates. In one video, a woman mischievously tucks away a strand of hair as she mails in her ballot, “proudly” canceling out her boyfriend’s ballot – “because someone paid attention in US History & has to care about keeping the Dept of Education!!!!” In another, a woman dances to Ciara’s Level Up before driving off to “cancel out” her “Trump loving Husband’s vote in a swing state”.

The dozens of women participating are, for the most part, Democrats supporting Kamala Harris’s bid, while their male partners are voting for Donald Trump. (Owens did not disclose who she or her boyfriend voted for.) Though their posts provide levity in the final days of an ugly presidential race, they also underscore the [pivotal role](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/20/elections-2024-gender-data-abortion?CMP=share_btn_url) gender is playing in the election.""",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"There was an article earlier this year about the return of full fledged sharia law in Afghanistan with the Taliban’s most recent announcement that it is resuming publicly stoning women to death for adultery. They have systematically eliminated right after right in the name of religion and noone has stepped up to stop it or speak out for the women. For a country that actually gave women the right to vote in 1919 before even the US, women are now completely completely without power there. No right to vote, no right to education past 6th grade, no right to work, or even to go anywhere without male supervision and now stoning and death death based on whatever definition of a crime that the men decide to give.  A quote from one of the leaders was chilling. He said, “You may call it a violation of women’s rights when we publicly stone or flog them for committing adultery because they conflict with your democratic principles,” he said, adding: “But I represent Allah [God], and you represent Satan.”

These trumpers who scream about evil muslims taking over are on the road to their own US version of this.

If women are secretly cancelling out their husband/partner’s vote, is it really a healthy relationship? I have seen multiple comments to this trend that advocate divorce instead of secrecy and lying. I realize not all women are in a place in their lives where divorce is an easy or safe option. Many women are trapped, financially and physically into a marriage where physical or verbal abuse is common. If the orange turd loses, their husband/parter make take it out on the women. 

I am in a 20 year marriage to a wonderful woman that has a mind of her own, but is usually aligned with me on an ideological line. We argue from a point of Leftist vs. Progressive on a lot of issues, but I’m much more conservative when it comes to fiscal matters. I love my wife and respect her decisions. Unfortunately, not all women are able to speak their mind freely without the threat of verbal, emotional or physical abuse.

"I was born here. My Mother was born here. My Grandmother was born here. Her grandmother was born here. My mother  has been batting off missionaries with a broom for nigh-on 50 years. I've attended their church a few times and, from study, know the theology better than some actual members. I drive past two temples on my way to work and another looms outside my window, even as I write this. I've seen how the church affects the lives of my friends and my friends' parents, and it casts an omnipresent shadow on every interaction I've ever had. I have registered as a republican to vote against the worst option in almost every primary and have sat in my high school library during a caucus and watched a video about the 'party platform of family values' so I could vote for Nickie Haley against Trump in this election. I have talked with young women who come from Young Women's studies and how they are instructed to ""Marry a returned missionary in the Church."" I have talked with young men and about the pressure they're under to go on a mission and return to marry a young woman, in the temple, after their mission. I know people that have followed this route and people that have deviated from it. I know how both are treated. I attended a seminary and listened to my fellow male students say that, if it were up to them, their 'future brides' wouldn't be allowed to date at all before they were married. Besides my mother, I have exactly one relative I see frequently who isn't a member of the church and she is even more religiously zealous than the Mormons I know. I know that my niece is the \*sole\* female relative I have that is explicitly pro choice. The next most supportive is my mother. But she's \*deeply\* ambivalent and would sellout the issue in a heartbeat for something she actually cared about. And I sat through election night in 2016 and watched McMullen slide of nearly half of Trump's support in the vote total... And watched Trump still walk away with a landslide victory.

But by all means. Enlighten me. Tell me about my rabidly anti-abortion aunt, my extremely conservative ex-girlfriend, her grandmother who thinks Obama is a Muslim, my friend's mother who likens abortion to murder, my never-missed-a-day-of-church grandmother.

"The commenter above you is right, though. And it isn't cowardly to see or explain it - it's the *reality* of what is going on. 

For most people (at least prior to 2020) politics was a small piece of their lives. They paid almost no attention and thus never developed a sense of what is ""normal"" in politics or global or economic affairs. They didn't have to, they had elected officials to do that for them. But this meant they were ill prepared to take in and weigh the firehose of misinformation shot at them from every side: TV, social media, friends, family, church. How do you distinguish between ""Biden controls gas prices"" and ""Biden meets with OPEC"" when you have no idea what is actually in control of the presidency, how gas prices work, or who OPEC is? You don't. You can't. So you rely on the voices around you who speak with confidence on the topic and - out of intellectual laziness - adopt those opinions as your own. Those opinions are then reinforced every where you turn. Until ""Biden raises gas prices to pay for immigrants to come take your job"" sounds like fact to you. You're still not really interested in politics so you hear the exaggerated snipits from Fox and Facebook and decide that's all you need to know 

At some point you start to think ""Maybe Biden didn't do that and all these people are wrong?"" But you think you're the only one with these doubts. For years now you've heard your community talk about ""libs"" as if they are sent from the devil and deserving of physical punishment. How stupid would it be for you to say ""actually, I've defected from this little cult and am switching to the other side""??? You'd lose your friends, family, possibly your business depending on your situation. And for what? You publicizong your defection won't change their minds. It will only hurt you, badly. But you can still do what's right and vote for Harris behind closed doors without risking ruining your life.

That's the reality for a HUGE number of people in pro-Trump neighborhoods. And, like the Catholic Church and the Mormon Church, you don't know that those same doubts exist in the hearts of all your fellows because fear of consequences for even *thinking* differently keeps you all quiet even from one another.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Hmmm. You might have a point. I can see this peer pressure effect being real as a matter of human psychology -- which is sadly irrational, because if there are fewer voters, your vote is more impactful, so smaller turn out should encourage voting by making each voter more important to the outcome.

Democrats have maintained a high bar, actually vetting people and adopting better policies to maintain the party there's certainly a diverse range of people and that's really an excellent quality. I'd trust leadership which takes a measured action.

This does show an intrinsic flaw with having two parties today, while they may have begun closer to each other and actually debate with some nuance, as time moves forward and there's a gradual shift of party culture over generations than they move farther apart. Right now, there's no way the republicans will be able to recover.

If you can structure an argument, justify your reasoning, and reach plausible conclusions on your exams - you can pass law school and the bar exam without ever actually learning anything concrete.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

It benefits him to wear the robes of a Christian nationalist right now because that's what their voting base wants.

He wants to be a chameleon and go with whatever is currently most popular with the conservative base in order to move his political aspirations forward. Before Trump's hostile takeover of the party, he toed the traditional conservative line. Now that Trump controls the party, Vance is all-in on the racism and misogyny of MAGA (albeit with a very thin veneer of 'plausible deniability') and has fully flip-flopped on numerous issues.

He's not an investigative journalist or interrogator, he's just a relatively normal guy with a penchant for conspiracy theories. Does he gives shitty ideas/people too much reach and is he frequently used by scam artists to hawk their latest fiction/ideology/product? Undoubtedly yes.

I don't think he's a bad dude, he's just a heart on the sleeve commentator without a clear political allegiance and a relatively open mind, I wouldn't say he's impartial, but he's about as impartial as it's reasonable to be at this stage in the race. He's like jock asmongold with the controversy dial turned down to a 5 doing the best he can in a shitstorm of electoral frenzy, honestly I was pleasantly surprised by the questions he asked.

He's someone who the collective right and collective left both have their issues with, but he's not deceptive, and I don't believe he has a real political agenda here, his motivations are to grow his brand and his clout, and to take out the narrative trickery we've become accustomed to in legacy media interviews.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

But no, JD Vance is such an elitist prick that he doesn't *want* to engage meaningfully with Donut Shop workers.

"Me too to be honest, but I think the reason shit like this works in trumps favor is because even his supporters know he’s an awful person, and all the imitators try to be “nice people” on a shallow level. Trump wants to be the biggest asshole in every room and they love him for it. His policies mirror his personality, all these “trump but competent/polished/charismatic” personas that politicians keep trying to play don’t land with the people who want to be willfully awful and use trump as a proxy to hurt others. They can’t sell it because the buyers want unbridled antagonistic hate and that doesn’t mesh with gee-whiz nerds like desantis, who are politically just awful too but they want that veneer of decorum and sophistication. I dunno, maybe I’m wrong I’m just saying a lot of the really hardcore mags like the awful, so trying to be charismatic in a disarming way would be seen as soft to them.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Kamala Harris has a [big lead over Donald Trump](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/11/01/kamala-harris-donald-trump-us-election-latest/) among American voters who say they have already cast their ballots, polls show.

The Democratic nominee had an advantage of 19 to 29 points over her Republican rival, according to tallies by ABC News-Ipsos, New York Times-Siena College and CNN.

The lead is larger than the one Hilary Clinton had over [Donald Trump](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/did-joe-biden-call-trump-supporters-garbage-election/) in the run up to the 2016 election, when polls showed the Democratic nominee leading with 8 to 16 points.

[Joe Biden](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/30/us-election-live-donald-trump-kamala-harris/) had a greater margin in late 2020 polls when Democrats embraced mail voting, while Trump attacked it and persuaded his supporters not to do it.

Polling shows that Ms Harris has a significant advantage in swing states, where the two parties have similar levels of support and where the outcome of the election will be decided.

According to polls from Marist, CNN, Fox News and USA Today-Suffolk University, Ms Harris leads among early voters in the key battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

[Only in Nevada](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/voters-fled-california-could-win-nevada-donald-trump/) does any major poll indicate an early [Trump swing state advantage](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/01/washington-picked-right-president-donald-trump-election/), with a CNN study showing a six-point lead.

There has been Republican excitement over increased levels of early voting by their supporters, which led [Elon Musk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/01/democrats-campaign-strategy-using-elon-musk-x-trump/) to declare that Trump was “trending towards a crushing victory”.

Four years ago, Trump was vehemently opposed to early and mail-in voting, saying it was vulnerable to fraud. This time around, Trump and Republican party officials have adapted their messaging to encourage supporters to cast their ballots before election day on Tuesday.

Mr Musk’s prediction was based on a comparison from Pennsylvania of 2024 vote-by-mail turnout against turnout levels from this point in the 2020 race, which showed registered Republicans making up 32 per cent of the early vote compared with 21 per cent in 2020.

Early voting data tends to favour Democrats as the party encourages its supporters to [cast their ballot early](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/us-presidential-election-2024-when-dates-candidates-voting/) so less is left to chance on election day.

Women are also voting early in large numbers and Democrats, who have made reproductive rights [a central campaign issue](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/us-election-donald-trump-kamala-harris-november-5-issues/), see the female vote as key to a Harris victory.

According to the University of Florida’s Election Lab, 54 per cent of the 60 million Americans who have already voted are women.

Ms Harris led Trump by 12 points among female voters in October, according to an analysis of Reuters/Ipsos polls.

Experts have warned [against over-interpreting early polling data](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/election-superstitions-people-think-determine-white-house/), as the subsamples of those who say they have already submitted their ballot have larger margins of error.

Mail-in and early voting began at scale in the US during the Civil War, but has seen a significant expansion since 2000. Most states offer in-person and mail voting though options vary.

"This suggests a fair amount of R crossover and NPA breaking for Harris. But let’s be honest, this is what we were expecting.

Things haven't gone back to the pre-pandemic voting patterns. This is all entirely speculation from both sides,  especially when the margins are so tight.  Literally 1-2% swings each way can decide the election,  so any of these early vote predictions with massive error margins ate kind of useless.  Don't pay attention to it.

He’s turned off all reasonable people, and a lot of republicans are either reaching across the aisle or not voting. Very few Dems are voting for Trump. Furthermore, Trump killed a lot of his supporters through his terrible Covid response.

At the end of the day though, if Harris loses, no riots will happen. You cannot in good faith say the same about your side if Trump loses. You pretty much are already rejecting any result that isn’t a Trump win, which is what he wants",2024_11_02,05_26_36

States shouldn't have a say in any health decisions it should be up to a doctor and the person it directly affects, not you and not a state government Did you know that it is still  dangerous  to carry a baby. Women still die in childbirth, even in healthy pregnancies. Some people don't even have access to healthcare. So yes abortion is absolutely awful. It truly is, especially if you are the one that needs one. And maybe if women's health care gets taken seriously and things change for the better.

By contrast, in Florida they do all the prep work before Election Day. They open the envelopes as they come in, unfold the ballots, check the signatures, put them in stacks that can quickly and easily be run through the scantron machines, etc. Then on Election Day, they can tally those votes first thing in the morning, so by the time the polls close the SoS can publish the early vote immediately.

"> Republicans who are showing up early can't show up again on Election Day

Not that they won't try",2024_11_02,05_26_36
">Republicans who are showing up early can't show up again on Election Day. If you assume a 5% defection from Republicans in swing states and that Independent voters go 60/40 to Dems (both of which I think are fair if not underestimating it), then it is 56/44 dems in swing states that share party affiliation votes.

What if you assume something else though? Assume defections favor Harris by 2% overall, and ""independents"" - whoever that is these days - turn out to be 55/45 for Trump because they don't like the sound of all the pet eating and sex changes for kids that they indirectly heard Kamala supports via casual consumption of Fox while in the waiting room of a doctor's office? What do your numbers say then?

Edit to add:
I don't think we know what's working out there. I like Redditors, but we are an echo chamber. I want to believe the country is sick of Trump's bullshit. A month ago, I was convinced it was. But I'm a liberal surrounded by liberals in my city, state, and online communities, and 90%+ of the political discussion over the last 4 weeks has been what Trump just said or did. That kind of obsession, even if it's generally negative, seems like it makes him more viable. 

I wish we would all talk and share more about what Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are doing & pledging to do to make America better than it ever has been. That gets people off the couch (insert Vance joke) to vote. More tired outrage over Trump lying or being disgusting just makes them want to tune out.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

I'm a ""liberal"" surrounded by conservatives, everywhere, and I am an independent by (non) affiliation. 

There are some very worrying signs (for Trump) in my anecdotal experience of my deeply red area. Farmers and rural-living people are turning toward Harris/Walz at what appears to be an appreciable rate. 

We'll see if it's true or a mirage, but truthfully all the bullshit that comes out about Trump tends to turn would-be Republican voters off in a way that leads to disengagement or even crossing their vote altogether, not so much making him seem 'more viable'. I'd argue that it drives more votes against him because people just want it all to go away.

Bernie Moreno in Ohio is turning a LOT of people off with his bullshit as well. I know several Trump/Brown voters, which is odd... but Moreno is so hung up on demonizing trans people that he is losing his audience.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

From your lips to God's ears, my man. And yes--it could be totally over-represented, because there's no real way to quantify it, but it does \*seem\* like there are a lot of Republicans who will be sitting it out or voting for Harris. Reddit may be an echo chamber, but a lot of the people in this echo chamber know Republicans who are voting for Harris. 

""Bernie Moreno in Ohio is turning a LOT of people off with his bullshit as well""

I'm not a conservative, and the odds of me voting for a conservative ever again, for the rest of my days, is just about zero. But I believe strongly that our nation needs a sane, stable conservative movement. In a surprising way, Trump poses a real threat to the GOP, because the people who rise to the top when Trump is around (Moreno, that lunatic in NC, etc.) are *deeply* unpopular to the vast majority of people. That old chestnut from Lindsay Graham (""Trump will destroy us"") could come true if he wins in 2024. And as much as I don't like the GOP, I don't think that's a good thing, because what would replace it would be a very destructive party.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

I live in the area and again this is all wishful ancedotes but there's a lot more Harris signs and about the same amount of Trump signs here in Oakland County which was \~ 56% Biden last time. 

Also we've elected a female Governor and AG against a trump backed anti-abortion woman in the 2022 election and she lost pretty handily. I know that is very different but again it's better than me saying a Trump backed anti abortion woman lost by 0.5% or won even in 2022. Then I'd be worried.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"It’s anecdotal, but I echo what the other guy said. I work in rural areas that are deep red. I wouldn’t underestimate how badly Trump’s policies fucked rural businesses and how much Biden’s policies have improved things. I in 5 rural Americans now have access to clean energy. The bulk of jobs created in the past 3 years were in rural areas. Farmers and ranchers were completely fucked when Trump gave the industry over to the big monopolies. I’m not expecting a huge defection or anything, but the enthusiasm for Trump out here is absolutely nothing like 2016 or 2020. 

As far as the GOP goes, my money is on Independents stepping up. More people are registered as independent, Indies in areas like NE-02 and Utah are putting up extremely competitive races in otherwise very red areas. While I personally think “we need conservatives for balance” is a pretty weak concept considering what we really need are actual budgets that aren’t starving the beast and feeding the corporations and even “principled” fiscal conservatives are on that train, we’ll no doubt see the corporate shills you’re longing for come out of the woodwork before too long.

No guarantees of course, but a lot of the little factors that make a difference in a state like this have been getting attention. This is the first cycle I haven't felt like the Dems weren't really doing enough to truly win the state, they are serious about it without a doubt.

# Analysis of Public Statement Under True Threat Doctrine

*Date: November 1, 2024*

## Summary

This memorandum analyzes a recent public statement by Donald Trump regarding Liz Cheney under the ""true threat"" doctrine, considering both immediate legal standards and broader contextual factors.

## Statement at Issue

>""Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face"" ([Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-cheney-face-guns-arizona-rally-rcna120679))

## Legal Framework

### Federal Law

Under 18 U.S.C. § 875(c), it is a federal crime to transmit ""any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another"" in interstate commerce ([Source](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/875)). The Supreme Court in *Watts v. United States*, 394 U.S. 705 (1969), established that only ""true threats"" fall outside First Amendment protection ([Source](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/394/705/)).

### True Threat Doctrine

In *Virginia v. Black*, 538 U.S. 343 (2003), the Supreme Court defined ""true threats"" as ""statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals"" ([Source](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/538/343/)).

### State Law Considerations

Under Arizona Revised Statutes § 13-1202(A), threatening or intimidating is defined as follows ([Source](https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/01202.htm)):

A person commits threatening or intimidating if the person threatens or intimidates by word or conduct:

1. To cause physical injury to another person or damage to property of another; or
2. To cause, or in reckless disregard to causing, serious public inconvenience including evacuation of a building, place of assembly, or transportation facility; or
3. To cause physical injury to another person or damage to property of another in order to promote, further or assist in the interests of or to cause, induce or solicit another person to participate in a criminal street gang, a criminal syndicate or a racketeering enterprise.

## Prima Facie Analysis

### Elements Under 18 U.S.C. § 875(c)

1. Interstate communication
2. Contains a threat
3. Defendant transmitted knowingly and intentionally

### Factors Supporting Protected Speech Classification

* Conditional and hypothetical nature (""Let's see how she feels"")
* Public forum context about a public figure (heightened First Amendment protection under *New York Times v. Sullivan*, 376 U.S. 254 (1964)) ([Source](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/376/254/))
* Rhetorical rather than specific threatening language
* Absence of immediate expressed intent

### Criminal Threatening Elements (ARS § 13-1202)

To establish criminal threatening, prosecutors must prove:

1. Statement constitutes a genuine threat rather than protected speech
2. A reasonable person would interpret it as a serious expression of intent
3. Threat is not merely conditional or ambiguous
4. Intent to threaten or intimidate through word or conduct

## Contextual Considerations

### Pattern of Incitement Analysis Under Brandenburg

Under *Brandenburg v. Ohio*, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), speech advocating illegal conduct is protected unless it is ""directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action"" ([Source](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/)).

### Historical Impact Evidence

* Law enforcement documentation of increased threats (FBI Bulletin 2021-0345)
* Academic studies correlating political rhetoric with violence (American Political Science Review, Vol. 115, No. 4)
* Threat assessment protocols (U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center guidelines)

### Relevant Case Law on Context

* *Planned Parenthood v. American Coalition of Life Activists*, 290 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir. 2002) (context of violence against specific targets relevant to true threat analysis) ([Source](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1332957.html))
* *United States v. Turner*, 720 F.3d 411 (2d Cir. 2013) (history of violent responses to similar statements relevant) ([Source](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1638466.html))

## Analysis

### Application of True Threat Doctrine

While the statement in isolation might not meet the *Watts* test for a ""true threat,"" several factors warrant consideration under *Virginia v. Black*:

1. Speaker's documented history of followers acting on inflammatory statements
2. Established pattern of similar rhetoric leading to violence
3. Speaker's demonstrated awareness of influence over followers' actions

### Brandenburg Test Application

The statement potentially fails the imminence requirement of *Brandenburg*, but the ""likely to produce such action"" element merits closer examination given:

1. Documented patterns of follower response
2. Specific targeting of named individual
3. Clear description of violent acts

## Conclusion

Though the statement alone likely falls short of criminal threatening under ARS § 13-1202 or 18 U.S.C. § 875(c), the speaker's established pattern of inflammatory rhetoric resulting in actual violence provides critical context that could influence its reasonable interpretation under *Virginia v. Black*. The totality of circumstances suggests a more nuanced legal analysis is warranted than traditional true threat doctrine alone would indicate.

## Recommendation

1. Document and monitor specific impacts for potential future legal consideration
2. Consider referral to threat assessment units for evaluation under USSS protocols
3. Review for potential civil liability under relevant statutes
4. Maintain records for possible pattern evidence in future proceedings

"Sad truth….but I seriously don’t expect anything to come of it. 

He was speaking about her being an avowed hawk on war and stating this as  “see how hawkish she is with 9 barrels in her face”. It’s he same well crafted bullshit he’s done his whole adult life. (Remember “Stand down, and stand by”?). 

Reality is this….Trump has spent a life mastering plausible deniability. He’s a horrible businessman, but that doesn’t matter as he’s always been solid at being litigious and learning how to communicate in a litigious world. 

It should never be forgotten that he cut his teeth in this under Roy Cohn, who cut his teeth under Joseph McCarthy, one of political skill that used his skill big time for ill l, rather than for good to a grossly damaging degree). 

This weird way of speaking to both make threats and have some level of plausible deniability is incredibly effective under ideologically co-opted (and in many cases just not very bright) supportive voters/zombies. 

And that’s what this was…..a whistle to the zombies. A nice visual of this woman with guns in her face. Just the kind of Americans that would…..mock Kamala being led in chains in a parade. They are seeing really bad news in turnout numbers so far.   They need to try to charge their base. 

I say all this to say…he whistled to the zombies here. A vision of a threat. Everyone absolutely call it out. Point at it like the DiCaprio pointing at the TV screen gif. When you see this bullshit absolutely scream it from the rooftop. 

But the system still isn’t set up to handle this……double speak with deniability. I don’t see much coming from this. I’m glad they are looking closer. Because if we get through this election well enough we need our leaders to work to set up guide rails against such dangerous speak from someone with so much profile trying to get so much power.

I think the concern is more about the explicit evocation of violence against her, even if he was just trying to say she's a hypocrite. It's about escalating violent rhetoric, especially given Trump's other comments about her and others, and the history of violence justified by perpetrators by referring to Trump's comments.

He could have called Cheney a hypocrite without being so provocative, and so \*explicitly\* propositional of violence: ""Cheney sends others into battle when she wouldn't go into battle herself"", for example. But no, he says ""let's do X, Y, and Z."" Is it rhetorical? Sure. Suggestive though? Yes. Are Trump's comments being spun in a misleading way? Probably but Trump also has a history of trying to avoid responsibility by indirectly suggesting things via ""code"".

How every single (almost) former staffer, cabinet member, lawyer, and other important officials, hundreds of former Republican president admin officials, Hundreds of other Republican politicians, dozens of papers, journals, hundreds of celebrities, can all endorse Harris and Trump would still win.

How Trump becomes more and more plainly delusional and insane. Aggressive and vindictive. Cruel and out of control and he could win against Kamala Harris.

How his own chief of staff and chief of national security could state openly and plainly on the record that he is a fascist and admires dictators and strongmen, and the American people would elect him. 

How we have seen for near a decade the vile, disgusting, disturbing man he is and people could still get believe he is best for our country. 

It makes no sense. If Trump wins, it will not be the fault of Kamala Harris and her campaign. It will be us who let her and let America down. We will deserve the future we get.

If they really want us to be comfortable and try to become mothers, they have to accept that we want the medical options to be available for us just in case we suffer miscarriages or life threatening problems due to the pregnancy.

"Sort of, yeah.

Trump has caused a massive shift in the traditional voter demographics, meaning that the old assumptions of pollsters no longer apply.

"That's true, but it's also due to the changing nature of how pollsters get their information.  While many of the older generations have land line phones, that's less the case with people in their 40s and younger.  And many of these people don't answer phone calls from unknown parties, so they're very hard to reach.

"Well, they've had 8 years to try to pin him down.  What I think is a more interesting question is whether polling for Harris is accurate.

A tween/teen in 2016 is now able to vote. Lots has indeed changed.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"> Polling is a great indicator to get a feel for the temperature but they don’t always accurately predict election winners and turnouts and they kind of neglect large parts of the electorate.

Polls tend to neglect low engagement voters because they are much harder (read: more expensive) to poll. This demographic tends to lean towards Trump. If anything the polls are much more likely to underestimate Trump in a higher turnout elections such as the presidential ones, as happened in 2016 and 2020.

The only way the polls are realistically underestimating Harris is if there is a significant bloc of ""silent"" women voters who votes based on abortion policy, but there is very little to suggest that that is the case.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"She's intentionally avoided identity politics in her campaign. She would be a lot of firsts, but Hillary's campaign largely relied upon identity politics rather than the fundamentals of her candidacy. It felt very ""vote for me because I'll be the first woman president"" and Harris is going for ""vote for me because I'll be a good president"". A lot of the Republican defectors and independents that she's trying to court would reject her if she focused on being the first this or that, but she still accomplishes all those firsts if she just focuses on her individual merits and likability instead, which is what she's doing.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"As a man, I'll be quite happy and proud of our country if we elect our first woman president.

But I'll be devastated and seriously thinking about renouncing my American citizenship if Trump wins. I think that's how many of us feel, we need to focus on the really important thing first.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Has to be intentional. Clinton made it a central part of her campaign and I think some people were annoyed by it,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"3 million more people voted for Clinton in 2016.  7 million more voted for Biden/Harris in 2020--with the full understanding that Biden was old as hell, could pass on at any time, and that Harris would step up to replace him.  

Americans have been fine with having a woman POTUS for awhile now.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"If Harris loses there's still the possibility that Joe steps aside between November and January so that Harris can go down in the books as president, if only for a couple of weeks.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I \*sincerely\* think both campaigns are avoiding issues that might get people to avoid voting because of them. For both, they're treating the immunity decision like a third rail. For Harris, she's positioning herself away from 'historic' in favor of competence and determination, IMO. Best way to make 'first woman president' matter less as an attribute is to be so good at it that it's a footnote to an incredible legacy.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I'm not so worried about the post election shenanigans as I am about congress and senate results.

It will certainly be mountains better than Trump, but it's really time for significant positive changes for average people.

Brilliant move by Kamala staying away from identity politics. She doesn’t even engage when asked questions about it.

From the article:

> ""It’s hard to overstate how traumatic the 2016 and 2020 elections were for many pollsters. For some, another underestimate of Mr. Trump could be a major threat to their business and their livelihood. For the rest, their status and reputations are on the line. If they underestimate Mr. Trump a third straight time, how can their polls be trusted again? It is much safer, whether in terms of literal self-interest or purely psychologically, to find a close race than to gamble on a clear Harris victory.

> At the same time, the 2016 and 2020 polling misfires shattered many pollsters’ confidence in their own methods and data. When their results come in very blue, they don’t believe it. And frankly, I share that same feeling: If our final Pennsylvania poll comes in at Harris +7, why would I believe it? As a result, pollsters are more willing to take steps to produce more Republican-leaning results.""

Not much suggests that. We would see a stronger gender disparity in the numbers if that was the case.

> Women across the entire country are having their basic healthcare rights threatened and taken away by a rapist and the ultra Christian man-o-sphere.

Yes, but there is a likely issue that a lot of uneducated/unknowledgable voters actually do not identify Trump as the reason for Roe v. Wade being repealed. For once it happened during a Dem presidency, and many people will simply associate guilt with the Supreme Court.

The second is that abortion is not a ""new"" issue to this election, which makes it harder for Dems to drum up voter enthusiasm about the issue.

That said there is a fair chance that women voters might decide the election, but in any case it will be very close.

> The orange one is also threatening mass deportation

But white women as a whole give the Republicans the edge, specifically Baby Boomers and older.  Black women are the ones who vote 95%+ for Democrats.  Trump enjoyed a +7 for white women over 50.

"There's a reason the Harris campaign is doing so many events with and publicizing the conservatives that are supporting her.  A candidates most valuable resource is their time, and they've spent a lot of her time courting Republicans to vote for her.

The Harris campaign has to believe it's worth it.

How many Republicans are going to vote for Harris?

Only 6% of Republicans voted for Biden in 2020.  After January 6th and all of his legal trouble, will the Haley voters cross?

Historically, 6% is the low mark for Republicans voting for a Democrat. 

>6% R for Obama in 2012 

>8% R for Hillary in 2016

>6% R for Biden in 2020

Democrat vs GOP crossover.  Often its Independent voters deciding, but sometimes the candidate gets screwed by their own party.

2008 - 10% Democrat, 9% Republican | Obama (won), McCain 

2004 - 11% Democrat, 6% Republican | Kerry, Bush 2 (won)

2000 - 11% Democrat, 8% Republican | Gore, Bush 2 (won)

"Oct. 31, 2024, 3:06 PM EDT  
By Steve Benen  
Retired Adm. William McRaven, the former commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command, is perhaps best known to Americans as the Navy SEAL who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He has also become a highly effective Donald Trump critic, as evidenced by the retired admiral’s latest op-ed in The Wall Street Journal.  

""	The White House is the home of American leadership, where Republican leaders like Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Teddy Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush resided. While each of these leaders had his shortcomings and foibles, none of them consistently violated every principle of good leadership like Donald Trump does. Mr. Trump has no self-control. He lashes out at immigrants, religious groups and military heroes. He lies with reckless abandon. In August, in what was outlandish even by Mr. Trump’s standards, he reposted on Truth Social a picture of Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton above a crude sexual joke. Just last week he was regaling a crowd about Arnold Palmer’s anatomy. These are things a disturbed 15-year-old boy would do, not the commander in chief, not the man who holds the nuclear codes, not the leader of the free world.""  
	
McRaven’s piece didn’t explicitly endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, but the retired admiral said the Democratic nominee “won’t threaten the press, demean immigrants, mock those who have died for the country, break with our allies, or undermine the Constitution.”

He concluded that he couldn’t vote for Trump.

I’ve long been fascinated by McRaven’s gradual transition from a retired military leader, content to leave political fights to others, to someone who felt compelled by Trump’s antics to enter the political debate in earnest.

Just weeks into the Trump era, for example, the retired admiral tipped his toes in these waters, describing Trump’s condemnations of his own country’s free press as possibly “the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.”

About a year later, after the then-president said he would revoke the security clearances of some of his critics, McRaven wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post urging Trump to revoke his security clearance, too — explaining that he would consider it “an honor” to stand alongside those “who have spoken up against your presidency.”
In 2019, McRaven wrote another piece, this time for The New York Times, reflecting on the president’s willingness to break faith with American allies and American principles. He added that “the fate of our Republic” may depend upon replacing Trump as quickly as possible.

In early 2020, McRaven wrote another Washington Post op-ed, which concluded, “As Americans, we should be frightened — deeply afraid for the future of the nation. When good men and women can’t speak the truth, when facts are inconvenient, when integrity and character no longer matter, when presidential ego and self-preservation are more important than national security — then there is nothing left to stop the triumph of evil.”

Four months later, the retired Navy admiral explained, “President Trump has shown he doesn’t have the qualities necessary to be a good commander in chief.” On the anniversary of D-Day, McRaven contrasted Trump’s style with the kind of qualities from earlier wartime leaders. “As we have struggled with the COVID pandemic and horrible acts of racism and injustice, this president has shown none of those qualities,” the admiral said. “The country needs to move forward without him at the helm.”",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Part of the morning CUB (commanders update brief) that the commanding general took every day included anything Trump has tweeted out the previous day/night because what he said on twitter could have major repercussions and destabilizing effects for our operations around the world. 

Generals were literally having to get intelligence assessments every day on the different ways our president had undermined our country/allies and put us at more risk.

"Yeah. I mean the Republican Party alone has been a major headache for the upper echelons of our military in recent years, as I understand it. It has become a yearly ritual for them to purposely hold up passing annual budgets to create political turmoil domestically. Something that forces the military to freeze much of its planning and spending efforts for weeks, sometimes months into their fiscal year. 

That alone is a major concern for our national security, even on just terms of the logistical challenges it causes alone. Considering the U.S. military is effectively the largest logistical organization on the planet, throwing even a small wrench into ongoing process is a huge, huge risk for us to take even once, let alone every. single. year. 

The modern GOP is no friend to the military. They aren’t even friends to the nation. They only care about their own agenda and they seem more than willing to let the strongest nation on Earth lose its prestige if it means they get to be in power. You ask me, that’s treason.

> A running concern for Milley was the prospect of Trump pushing the nation into a military conflict with Iran. He saw this as a real threat, in part because of a meeting with the President in the early months of 2020, at which one of Trump’s advisers raised the prospect of taking military action to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons if Trump were to lose the election. At another meeting, at which Trump was not present, some of the President’s foreign-policy advisers again pushed military action against Iran. Milley later said that, when he asked why they were so intent on attacking Iran, Vice-President Mike Pence replied, “Because they are evil.”

Arguably this is not a healthy trait in an intelligence officer and it's more disastrous at flag rank, when there is little pushback. When there was pushback, it fed into a victim/martyr complex.

"Here's his official endorsement: [Why I’m Voting for Kamala Harris](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-10-31/michael-bloomberg-why-i-m-voting-for-kamala-harris)

> I do not agree with Vice President Kamala Harris on every issue, but earlier this week, I voted for her without hesitation. I’d like to explain why, in hopes that others who have a history of supporting candidates in both parties — as I do — will join me.

> As I’ve thought about the candidates in this presidential election, I’ve been guided by two main considerations: policy positions and personal integrity.

> When it comes to policy, the contrast could not be clearer.

> And that brings us to the other consideration: personal integrity.

> As former Vice President Mike Pence and many other Republicans have concluded, Trump is not fit for high office. Not after refusing to accept the will of the people and trying to steal the 2020 election — first by attempting to strong-arm state legislators and election officials into overturning the results, and then, when that failed, by bamboozling people into attacking the Capitol to stop the counting of Electoral College ballots.

> He made our country, the world’s greatest nation, look like a banana republic. Most Americans never thought we’d witness such a shameful episode. Trump, rather than apologizing for it — as some of those convicted of Jan. 6-related crimes have done — celebrates it.

> Why? Because for him, nothing — not America, not our Constitution, not democracy, not the rule of law, not the lives of police officers or any other citizen — matters more than his own vanity and glory.

"Specifically about your concerns about publications and endorsements: America is going through another great realignment. The factions that make up the two lead parties are shifting considerably into new arrangements. That means leaders and institutions of some factions that used to be core to the parties are now on the outside - whether they want to admit it or not.

That's why you see union leaders supporting Trump while business Republicans are lining up behind Harris. In the current flux, both unions and business communities are swing voters - a wild first to have both groups ""on the outside"" of each coalition. 

It takes a little while for the dust to settle in these realignments. My suspicion, and Trump's conviction, is that the bulk of the business community and business-focused politicians will mostly move to the Democrats, while ""union voter"" ceases to be a thing, with union members not primarily voting based on treatment of unions or promotion of the union cause as a whole as a first priority. 

At times like this, endorsements from faction leaders and associated institutions count for far less, as they can represent factions who are no longer relevant to the voters they are trying to persuade. 

There's also the small matter that MAGA operates less as a political coalition and more as a messianic religious movement, in which its far easier to ignore dissident voices.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"“Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.

This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but, in those of the popular form, it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.

The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; **and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction party, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty.**

**Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.**

It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. **It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another** . . . .

**Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.**”

That's just a few.  While it is certainly true that a lot of the cases were dismissed on procedural grounds, that doesn't automatically lend them any credibility.  Consider also that the vast number of cases that Trump's campaign brought, were voluntarily dismissed by the campaign.

Consider also that when pressed under oath about some of the claims, there was not a single Trump-hired lawyer willing to say that they had definitive proof of voter fraud.  Rudy Guiliani explicitly said they did not in one of the Pennsylvania cases.

You really should think about getting your information from places other than memes.  Read the court cases and documents yourself.

It’s the same old song. But this time, the Republican central message is getting a big signal boost: Elon Musk. 
Now, it turns out there might be some voter fraud being committed — but not in Pennsylvania and not by Democrats. On Tuesday, Indiana state police said they had arrested Larry Savage, a Republican precinct committeeman and former congressional candidate. Police say he stole two ballots from a test of voting machines and then claimed the machines were flawed.

According to court documents, the investigators also searched Savage’s phone and found a text that read: ”sis, they say anything about the ballots i took.” Investigators also say he posted on a social media page condemning the county’s election procedures, shortly before police found the stolen ballots in his truck.

The irony is that you yourself are cherry picking and running some sort of interference on his language related to ""firing squads"".

 - Trump is running to be President, and he cannot properly articulate a very straightforward thought, like the one you did, in a way that doesn't inflame tensions? Why would anyone want such a person as the commander-in-chief? 
 - If the argument is that he can properly articulate the thought, then he's clearly doing so in a way that is fantasizing about a political opponent being in the line of fire. He did it twice. It's that simple. Who cares about the logistics of a firing squad when the image he is trying to invoke is obvious?

I’m getting the sense that 2016 was a lesson enough to get people out to vote for Biden, but that was too close for comfort, and the whole election cycle was just filled with dread (covid didn’t help obv)

Now the urgency to get more people to actually show up and vote is through the roof, and Kamala’s and Tim’s likability is way higher than anyone since Obama. Obviously it only counts if enough people actually vote, but I am also feeling optimistic about voter turnout this year. Honestly though I wish we could talk about feeling optimistic without people warning against complacency (not that I feel you’re doing that here). It’s possible to be optimistic without getting complacent - but it’s also possible to encourage people to vote without downplaying the few bright spots we get.

Kinda the opposite: we know the polls are bad and showing an artificial swing towards Trump now that it's October, so if Harris is STILL doing at or better than the MoE in places like PA, a blowout is coming.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Trump told the rally crowd on Wednesday that his advisers had been counseling him against describing himself as a “protector” for women.
“They said, ‘Sir, I just think it’s inappropriate for you to say.’ I pay these guys a lot of money; can you believe it?” Trump said.

It’s the same old song. But this time, the Republican central message is getting a big signal boost: Elon Musk. 
Now, it turns out there might be some voter fraud being committed — but not in Pennsylvania and not by Democrats. On Tuesday, Indiana state police said they had arrested Larry Savage, a Republican precinct committeeman and former congressional candidate. Police say he stole two ballots from a test of voting machines and then claimed the machines were flawed.

According to court documents, the investigators also searched Savage’s phone and found a text that read: ”sis, they say anything about the ballots i took.” Investigators also say he posted on a social media page condemning the county’s election procedures, shortly before police found the stolen ballots in his truck.

You will no longer be abandoned, lonely or scared. You will no longer be **in danger**. ... You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today.

Is there a hospital that errs on the side of a women’s life more often than not? Is one of the doctors or administrators a vocal opponent of the law or Republicans in general?

"Surely this AG will stop Trump!

"Unfortunately, this comment likely won't meet the standard for a death threat.  It could then be considered as incitement to violence, but it wouldn't meet that criteria either.

Trump has lawyers who know exactly how far he can go, and in both those charges the requirements are (for good reason) very specific.

Did he specifically threaten to kill Harris?  No.  Did he make a statement that has a very real chance to incite someone to try to kill her?  Yes.  Was that statement a direct call for someone to kill her?  No.

This statement has a real chance of causing violence, but the laws are justifiably written in such a way that he cannot be prosecuted for it.  As I said, he has lawyers who know exactly what he can legally say.  People think he constantly breaks the law and gets away with it.  With the exception of ""Justice"" Cannon, he's actually just skirting the law, and laws about incitement to violence are very specific and this is not a death threat.

I'm expecting plenty of downvotes for having stated the truth.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Everyone is saying that he's referring to a firing squad, but is glossing over the fact that he clearly says, ""Let's put her with the rifle"", and you don't give someone a rifle before putting them in a firing squad. You give someone a rifle before sending them to war.  Spreading this one and claiming it is something that it isn't just does gives the other side ammunition for dismissing all of the other stuff that he actually said.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Betas, eunuchs, and those who are not from military families may take issue with what Trump said which is put Cheney in a war zone where she may have guns trained on her and THEN see how much she is willing to push for more war. You may think this is threat, but it is a RHETORICAL statement. Some may be too dense to understand or simply too partisan to believe.

Those who serve in the military, or are from military families along with anyone who is able and willing to protect others with their life understand fully and completely what Trump was saying in his complete statement. Stick her ass in a war zone and let's see how much she still wants war. 

The politicians are all for war as long as they are not the ones doing the fighting. That is what he said. If you are too obtuse to understand, perhaps it is time to step back from your hatred and take a deep breath. 

I know such thoughts are not popular on this sub, but perhaps people need to hear other views besides a continuation of the same in order to expand your horizons.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

He worded it oddly (possibly intentionally so), which I think is why a lot of people view it as a death threat.  People think the ""nine barrels"" refers to a firing squad.  However, that doesn't really hold up if you read it carefully, because he clearly says, ""Let's put her with the rifle"", and you don't give someone a rifle before putting them in a firing squad.

">""She's a radical war hawk,"" Trump said of Cheney. ""Let's put her with a rifle standing there, with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.""

""Let's"" = Let us.  ""Us"" is language where the speaker is identifying as  a part of the group.  If he had said it another way, maybe he would have a defense, but he's identifying as part of a group that should put Cheney before the hypothetical firing squad.  

What if Trump had instead said, ""Tucker Carlson has been such an ally of our campaign.  Let's give him a round of applause.""  What do you think the audience would do?  ""Let's"" is an exhortation for the audience to act.  Obviously, no one in the audience is going to run out of the auditorium looking for Cheney, but it's clearly a call to action.  

If he had said something like, ""Let's imagine what would happen if someone put Liz Cheney..."", that would still be horrific, but it's be a lot more defensible.

Here's the bit these empathy-free, controlling, cruelty-bots skipped over:  ""If you feel you need to"".  

That's right.  If you feel your spouse would be angry, violent, or otherwise react poorly to how you choose to exercise your basic rights in this nation, you are not required to disclose your actions.  *If you need to*.  That's the premise.  

The only ones who would be keen on this, are the ones who find themselves attempting to be heard, while avoiding spousal abuse.  Because that's what we're talking about.  Whether physical or mental, it is still abuse if they are going to rage-fit your voting choice badly enough that it makes you want to keep it a secret.  

If your spouse is not abusive, and is tolerant of you having a similar or dissenting political view, then keeping it secret isn't important.  You can still do it, but it is less of a priority.  And in this case, your spouse is unlikely to even ask because of that first sentence in this paragraph - they likely already know your political stance.  We'd call that ""healthy communication"".

"An advert narrated by Julia Roberts encouraging women to keep their votes a secret from their husbands has triggered fury among Republicans.

“Remember, what happens in the booth, stays in the booth,” the actor says in the video encouraging women to cast their ballot for Kamala Harris.

“In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want. And no one will ever know,” she adds.

In the clip, two woman can be seen filling in their ballots before sharing a conspiratorial wink.

Conservatives branded it “nauseating” with Fox News host Jesse Watters suggesting the secrecy amounted to lying to your spouse.

Others mocked the idea that women needed to be reminded of the power of their vote.

Cheryl Chumley, a columnist for the Washington Times, called the advert “beyond condescending”.  “But then again, the story line plays right into how Democrats regard women who dare to vote conservative,” she wrote.

It is just the latest pitch by Democrats to women, with polls suggesting the White House race will be determined by a historically wide gender gap.

It’s the same old song. But this time, the Republican central message is getting a big signal boost: Elon Musk. 
Now, it turns out there might be some voter fraud being committed — but not in Pennsylvania and not by Democrats. On Tuesday, Indiana state police said they had arrested Larry Savage, a Republican precinct committeeman and former congressional candidate. Police say he stole two ballots from a test of voting machines and then claimed the machines were flawed.

According to court documents, the investigators also searched Savage’s phone and found a text that read: ”sis, they say anything about the ballots i took.” Investigators also say he posted on a social media page condemning the county’s election procedures, shortly before police found the stolen ballots in his truck.


Meanwhile, as Republicans are setting the scene for another attempted theft of the election, Democrats are trying to do what they did in 2020 and 2022, which is to get people out to vote and win a close race.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"

	•	Authoritarianism: Fascism centralizes power in a single leader or ruling party, diminishing or eliminating democratic governance and civil liberties.
	•	Nationalism: Fascist regimes promote extreme nationalism, emphasizing the superiority of their nation or ethnic group above others.
	•	Militarism: Fascism glorifies military strength and often prioritizes aggressive expansion or war to strengthen the nation.
	•	Suppression of Dissent: Fascist governments suppress opposition, often through propaganda, censorship, and violence against critics or political opponents.
	•	Corporate-State Alliance: Fascism often entails a partnership between government and large businesses to control the economy while keeping it nominally private, promoting industries that serve the state’s agenda.
	•	Anti-Individualism: The ideology promotes the idea that the individual is secondary to the collective will of the nation, often undermining personal freedoms in favor of state loyalty.
	•	Uniform Ideology and Identity: Fascism enforces a strict cultural and ideological unity, frequently persecuting minority groups or dissenting subcultures to maintain societal “purity” and order.

then came the insanity.  the more threads like this - the more her surrogates - bill clinton, obama, cuban, walz, lopez, biden, lizzie, etc - get out and tell people what they really think of people who dare 'oppose the party' --- the better poll numbers and early voting seem to be for Trump

so it's definitely not all of us don't want to hear this ---- quite a few of us encourage it.  

election day is only 4 days away - not sure how many threads like this you have time to start/manage, but certainly i would encourage you to enlist the help of your friends and peers.   what would help even more is if you could link the posts to videos of harris and her surrogates telling Americans how the democrat party actually and honestly views anyone and everyone who would dare to oppose them.

"They hear it, but they don’t want to hear it. It is a truth that infringes on their ability to see themselves as good people. And unfortunately, most people actively suck at recognizing when they’re behaving in a morally outrageous manner because they live entirely in a world of their intentions. 

But the road to hell is paved with good intentions for a reason. It’s easy to excuse atrocities when you’re convinced that they’ll bring about a better world. After all, that’s the trap the anti-abortion crowd has fallen into. They’re so in love with the idea of eliminating abortion that they don’t recognize that the number of women who will die from pregnancy complications is bigger than the number of aborted *viable* pregnancies (which is to say that the fetus could actually be a live birth that would survive until at least 5). They’re romanticizing potential and refusing to acknowledge reality. 

It’s the same flaw that has cause our education system to collapse: parents love the idea that their kids will be rich and take care of them in dottage, and they see academic failure not as a result of their kids being unwilling or unable to master the material but rather on an infringement on their right to retire wealthy. As such, they get apprehensive and attacked if their kids come home with bad grades.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Trump copies Hitler’s speech almost word for word. See 3:45 if you want to skip the intro: https://youtu.be/Tb7Kfg8hzzg?t=100

Trump wants “kind of generals that Hitler had” according to his former Chief of Staff John Kelly. https://youtu.be/pttEmrXdVRc?si=QUjhb2XBZABKIwhQ, https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/politics/trump-said-hitler-did-some-good-things-and-wanted-generals-like-the-nazis-former-chief-of-staff-kelly-claims

The Nazis did not start with genocide.

First, they accused Jews and immigrants of stealing jobs from Germans. They claimed Jews were killing babies and drinking their blood. Sounds similar to Republican claims that immigrants are stealing jobs, Democrats kill babies, and immigrants eat cats and dogs.

Then, the Nazis called for physical violence against their political enemies and the Jews. I recall Trump telling his supporters in 2016 to beat up protestors at his rally, and that he would pay for their legal bills if they did. He also told law enforcement to not cover the heads of people pushed into police cars so that those people would hit their heads. This past month Trump called for a day of violence where police could beat up suspects. Sounds like the Nazi Kristallnacht.

Trump ordered ICE to separate immigrant families and keep them in concentration camps. To this day, some of the children have not been reunited with their families. Sounds similar to what the Nazis did to their “undesirables.”

Hitler told Germany that only he could save the Germans from the Jews and communists. Doesn’t Trump say that only he can save America from communists?

"Yes. The dark secret about Nazi Germany that a lot of people refuse to accept is that most of the German civilians knew something really, really fucking bad was happening to their Jewish/gay/Roma neighbors— many even knowing near the end of the war that this “bad thing” was being gassed and exterminated in death camps. Most did not care, a huge percentage even agreed with it— they viewed it as “degenerates” getting what they deserved. Most who did oppose what was happening in principle lacked the conviction to do anything at all about it; they were just fine with keeping their head low and many even overcompensated by being some of the most prolific snitches/rats (in order to hopefully avoid the eye of the gestapo).

"Sure I think the wikipedia article for it sums it up nicely, formatted it for readability and added brackets are my own points:

Fascism is a far-right, authoritarian, and ultranationalist political ideology and movement, characterized by:

. A dictatorial leader (one for example, who tried to overthrow the results of an election that he lost)

. Centralized autocracy (project 2025 wants to fire public servants unless they swear loyalty to Trump, and he wants to shut down several government agencies) 

. Militarism (wanted to shoot protestors as reported by his aides)

. Forcible suppression of opposition (stated multiple times that people like Pelosi and Schiff are ""the enemy within"" and should be dealt with by the military)

. Belief in a natural social hierarchy (America is for Americans, Grab them by the pussy),

. Subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation or race (outlawing abortion, wanting to outlaw no fault divorces for example, clamping down on labor unions)

Trump fits every one of these descriptions, in multiple ways. I have provided some examples of each.

I have answered your question, now answer mine. How does Trump not fit the above description? Do you actually have a point or will you just continue to nitpick semantics? What should we describe him as?",2024_11_02,05_26_36

“But we still won’t endorse her because our petty ass billionaire boss won’t let us.”,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I liked her when she was running for senate. I had other choices ahead of her in the 2020 primary namely Elizabeth Warren, but still liked her. I felt like she disappeared as VP (as most do). This version of her has been incredible. I feel so much pride watching her speak and acting like a normal fucking person (much like Biden). 

I have a good feeling about Tuesday. Just hope everyone runs through the tape.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I'll admit I was a doubter before Biden stepped aside. She was quickly able to resolve all of my doubts by speaking like an adult without brain worms or obvious fascist tendencies.

Her background should be appealing to most Americans (except for the cult members). Once I saw prominent Republicans supporting her I knew she was the correct choice.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"And then some. Like the headline a few days ago said, it's not clear what else she could be doing. This is as well an executed campaign as any in recent memory.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I didn't really have an opinion one way or the other.

But, I do remember watching the coverage after the Biden debate and wondering why no one was talking about her taking over. To me it seemed like the only alternative possible outside of Biden continuing.

I think that media misstep gave her an opportunity for a second ""first impression"" and that helped propel her campaign out of the gate. However, since then she has definitely taken control and done the best anyone could do.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Okay but... I still don't know enough about her. 

\- Some ""undecided"" voter probably",2024_11_02,05_26_36
I was very skeptical of her campaigning abilities after the disaster of a campaign in 2020. But my God has she surprised me. She was met with unprecedented task of taking over with three months till the election and she has a really good shot at winning. If she wins her campaign should be studied at political science courses throughout the nation.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"And she had to be utterly perfect to do it, unlike orange shit stain…",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Now… I’m very happy she’s in and he’s out. Her abilities as a politician over his are just obvious at this point.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"No matter what happens, at least I’ll know we put up a fight. I was for Biden dropping out mainly because it felt like we were sleepwalking into a Trump administration with little resistance.

I didn’t necessarily care who took over, but I have admittedly been blown away by Kamala and the campaign she has run.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

There's an important test she needs to pass next week and she needs your help.  Vote!,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I've got to say I  had doubts as well.  In my book, she was the ""not Trump "" candidate.  She has come a very long way from her debate appearances in the 2020 primaries. She's worked very hard to earn the respect and trust of those of us in the center and I was proud to mark my ballot next to her name.  

Republicans:  do better.  I'm glad we have a worthy presidential candidate, but I would prefer it if the decision was even slightly harder.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I will admit to being one of those early doubters, and someone who is genuinely pleased with how she has handled every single step. There should be no doubt as to the superior candidate, especially given her opponent's very obvious dementia.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Donnie Fraud is still FURIOUS he spent $100 Million attacking the wrong candidate.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Tbh I’ve been pretty impressed how she’s conducted this. She has hardly made a single misstep the entire campaign (the only campaign cock up was the garbage thing, but that was freaking *Biden* who can’t even stay on message). I’ve wondered quite a bit about how much of that doubt chorus etc was really just some veiled sexism … or even that idea will people actually elect a Black woman, is she smart enough etc. Honestly what this campaign shows is that you build consensus through successful campaigning, not the other way round, and that equality is built through giving chances",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"There were many Democrats, including many here in this sub, who didn't want Harris to be Biden's replacement. I was irritated by that because I didn't see a good reason why it shouldn't be her. I said repeatedly that it wouldn't make sense for the nominee to be anyone but her. I ~~hate~~ love to say ""I told you so!"" 🙂

I think she'll win. But if she doesn't, she should still be proud of herself for the amazing campaign she's run.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
Fuck you Bezos you bald cock eyed bitch,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"There's actually one more test coming Tuesday next week.

But I agree, she hasn't made any mistakes that are obvious right now before the election, unlike Clinton not campaigning in ""blue wall"" states etc. Meanwhile Trump makes huge unforced errors on a daily if not hourly basis and the polls still don't budge.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
I haven’t been this excited about the future of our country since Obama’s first term.  She has well exceeded any expectations I’ve had.  I went from contemplating not even voting after the Biden debate debacle to feeling energized and excited about our country again.  Win or lose I’m proud of what Kamala has done… and I’m hoping for the best.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
proper headline: we kept moving the goal posts but she was too good and scored every single time,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I’m going to be honest. I legit thought Biden dropping out was going to be a death blow. I didn’t think Harris was going to stand a chance against Trump, especially with only three months to campaign.

But I think she misspoke once if I recall correctly. Disqualified! /s,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Not really,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"My ""honeymoon"" phase with her never ended once she entered the race. It's been really nice watching a competent person navigate all this. The reason you see a bit of fear in her eyes on the debate stage at the beginning or the impossibility of navigating the tight rope she must walk in interviews have its human foibles is because she's a human being who is morally minded. This much at least has been proven to me. 

I don't need my leaders to give great interviews and avoid gotcha moments. I need them to be morally minded with a pulse, and at least pretend to be accountable to ALL of your constituents. 

And voting against her opponent seems..... idk..... pretty logical.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Meh. She's better than Biden, electorally speaking, but it doesn't really change my vote from being anything other than strategic, and more a vote against Trump than a vote for her.

Personally, I wish we had had something of an actual primary instead of what transpired. At it stands, if she wins and gets a second term in 2028, we won't have an open primary until 2032.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Count me as one of the deepest of the doubters. The day the article broke saying she already had enough DNC support to be the candidate before the DNC started I said Trump just won in a landslide.

True. But they were very vocal of who they planned to endorse and why they couldn't endorse her.  Pretty much gave her an endorsement and actually raised the discussion to a much higher level. Not what Bezos was going for.,2024_11_02,05_26_36

A lot of redditors are convinced she lost the race by not going on Joe Rogan. I think they are a little out of touch with the real world.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
It’s all by accident or divine intervention IMO. DNC has been so inept for so long I think it may just be God at work IF Kamala wins and I’m not even a God person at all.. I never would have thought DNC could pivot so quickly to a black woman from California and keep the publicity so good that she could actually win. If this happens I will feel so much better about the future of the USA.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"A phenomenal campaign with one of the best bursts out of the gate I've ever seen. When Biden first dropped out I thought the best option was an open primary. I now realize the immediate coalescing around Harris was by far the better option, and I fully 100% believe it was Biden's plan for weeks or months beforehand, only pulling the trigger once he knew every single prominent Dem from AOC to Manchin would immediately endorse her. 

Dems in disarray no more!",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I think she could have done a lot more when it comes to the economy. A lot of uninformed voters like Trump because they remember the economy being better under him. She hasn't done enough to to reach these people in simple terms. Trump is campaigning on ""Harris = high prices, Trump = low prices"" its wrong and childish but thats the level these voters are at.

Also she needed something strong left leaning (so Trump cant steal it) like paid maternity leave.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Nobody could talk about that until Joe himself accepted the truth. That was an uneasy but necessary period of time from the debate to him dropping out.

But him dropping out while endorsing her was the key, together with the string of endorsements that immediately followed. We would have probably been sunk if any viable Democratic challenger (that excludes Joe Manchin lol) had thrown their hat in the ring to challenge her and prolonged the change. By that same night each of the ones who could have done that (Whitmer, Shapiro, etc) had expressed their full support for her and she was able to hit the round running.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Obama hesitated in his endorsement and I think he had the same initial concerns about the process, but a Biden-Trump rematch would have guaranteed a Trump victory. There was too little time to go through a normal primary, plus one of Alan Lichtman's 13 keys would have swayed over to Trump, the same key that fell in 2016 towards Trump from Clinton.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I know someone who worked for the state department and was involved in briefings.  Harris had a real rough first year as VP.  She ended up firing the majority of the staff she brought over from the Senate replacing them with more competent people.  She's demanding as in wanting all the relevant information and isn't afraid to ask questions and delve deeper.  That style of leadership requires a certain quality of subordinates.  I was impressed by her choice of Philip Gordon as National Security Advisor. Basically she Kamala did exactly what we should expect any elected official to do; step up and put in the work.  

 The sole exposure most people had to Harris before Biden stepped aside was her 2020 presidential campaign. I think concerns only natural.  She wildly exceeded my  expectations and I doubt I'm the only one.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I was a doubter - not really of her, but of the Democrats themselves. I didn’t believe they would coalesce around a single candidate with such fervour , enthusiasm, and almost maniacal support.

It is so on brand for Democrats to shoot themselves in the foot I was properly anxious they would fuck this up. But they handled it pretty well. And if Kamala wins, the way they did the transfer once Biden accepted he was stepping down from re-election will go down in American history as one of the smoothest fucking moves ever executed by a politician.

They played it perfectly since that moment, and turned the momentum of the entire race against Trump and the Republicans and finally gave Democratic voters someone to WANT to vote for. Not to mention the fact that she, Walz, and her campaign team - shout out to the social media and ‘zinger’ writers crew - who have smashed every pitch thrown their way out of the fucking park.

This is set to be the greatest American political story of all time, and it won’t even be close (if she wins.)",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Many eventually presidents failed during their initial runs.  Trump ran under the reform and Biden ran in 1998, I didn’t do much research but there are probably many others.

"Anyone who saw the Democratic presidential debates in 2020, knows Harris is a badass.  I went into that debate hoping Warren would be the first female president, I left it KNOWING in my heart that it should and would be Harris.  Yay!",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"She's not stupid, I think we can both agree on at least that?

She KNOWS about the ""Palestine thing"".

There is very clearly a reason she's not taking a strong stance on it before election day, and it must be because internal data must show that it would be toxic to her campaign to take the leftist perspective on this.

She's showing obviously empathy, by saying she wants a ceasefire and a two state solution, but I imagine anything more extreme beyond that has not polled well in test groups or data analysis.

You have to remember that Israel defense funding is a BIPARTISAN effort. The president cannot just send money to a foreign power without Congress passing it with bipartisan support. This is an issue with both Democrats AND Republicans, and independents/moderate Republicans are absolutely repelled by harsh language towards Israel due to history.

Moderates/Republican swing voters are the demographic that will help her win this, not leftists.

So you have to look at it from a tactical POV and have and LITTLE bit of faith that she's not deaf and dumb. Read between the lines a bit.

Netanyahu doesn't want her to win. He's talked with Trump about delaying the ceasefire just to fuck her over. She skipped his speech to Congress outright and has a meeting with them that left him *bitter*.

She has needed to be smart about this, while also taking in to account that she literally is not in any position to do anything about it regardless.

I understand peoples' inclination to empathize with Palestinians, but this is about more than just Gaza. This is about our country too, and in order for Gaza to have any semblance of a chance, she needs to win, and if she wants to win, she needs to carefully skirt whatever tight rope her data is telling her to skirt, and frankly she's been a damn near trapeze artist on that front.

Tactical maneuvers take priority over purely righteous ones when you're up against an opponent who literally just lies in every breath, and when winning is of the UTMOST importance. I'd rather she be meh on Gaza and win, than have been a complete bonafide Pro-Palestinian candidate and lose. It's about the big picture.

That being said, I do not consider her ""missteps on Gaza"" to be actual missteps. No. It's all been a tactical maneuver. She did what she had to, without straight up lying to the public like Trump is doing.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I super appreciate the pragmatism, though, and I agree she can be better.

"I think a big part of the reason Harris flamed-out in 2020 is that she really struggled with the dynamics of a primary.  Democractic Primaries are usually a race to left/progressive wing and the general is a race back to the center.  It's the same with GOP Primaries too and this is a big flaw in our political system that tends to deliver shitty candidates to the General Election.  The reason is that only the most engaged voters tend to vote in the primaries and those voters are overwhelmingly from the left/right wings of their own parties.

In 2020, she was trying so hard to keep one foot in the progressive wing and another foot anchored to the center that her remarks and answers to questions were muddled and she looked indecisive.   

To be fair, navigating the primaries vs. the general election is a very difficult political skill to pull off.  

She didn't have to deal with that dynamic this time and I think it made her a lot more comfortable on the campaign trail.

Also, despite her voting record being pretty progressive, she really is much more of a centrist than it appears.  I was all-in for her at the beginning of 2020 (I'm a California voter and have followed her career closely), but thought she was abysmal at campaigning. I never doubted her to be a competent executive.  I am very impressed with the discipline of her campaign since Biden dropped out.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I don't know. I'm very skeptical. There's unfortunately too many bad data points. I give my breakdown and forecast here:

https://youtu.be/kFDkvrICM48?si=hg9frcpe35Fpfc4w

In the comments I also address some points about the composition of early voting and eventual electorate:

The bottom line is turnout will determine election results. The early votes indeed show women turning out by a large margin in key swing states and elsewhere. If the composition of the final electorate is more female than years past, even by a few % points, that's a scenario where Harris can win. It's too soon to tell though since we still have a long way to go, and most people haven't voted yet. In general, there's several scenarios where Harris could win.

It's possible that the polls are overcorrecting vs 2020, but I think it's unlikely; the fact that so many polls show the same downshift away from the Democratic candidate and towards Trump, including versus the 2020 actual results (ignoring 2020 polls), is an important factor.

Here are the main reasons I still think Trump will win:
- 1: Republican voter registrations have surged this time around. And I expect Republican turnout to be strong, which is why I give them a +1 advantage in composition of the electorate (compared to -1 in 2020). Democrats have just done a poor job in comparison.
- 2: Among independents/leaners, there are are still so many people in the US who think presidents magically control prices, such as for gas and groceries, and who erroneously think a Trump presidency will get them lower prices.
- 3: Say what you will about the anti-Trans stuff (personally, I think it's contrived culture war nonsense/distractions), I believe these ads are effective. Never underestimate the ability of American voters to get easily distracted into voting against their own interests.
- 4: The Gaza/Israel conflict. I think there are enough people on the left, young voters, and among the Muslim American population who will sit out, vote third party, or even defect to Trump, that it could make a difference of up to 1pt.
- 5: While you can say women have turned out strongly, young voters are turning out poorly and that needs to change fast or else Harris doesn't have a chance. In general, banking on younger voters has often been a losing proposition.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

I believe Pew research has suggested that response rates to political polls are below 1% this year, down from 9% during the 2016 election which was down from something like 30% in 2008. It’s also been suggested that some trusted pollsters rely heavily or entirely on landline phone surveys, which means their contact lists are shorter and their response rates are lower.

"I'm trying to understand why people say the Republican voter registration surge is a bad sign.

The reason I ask that is because:

- (1) Democrats have already saturated their voter registrations in both 2020 and 2022 where they brought LOADS of people into the fold. So naturally, if you've already made considerable ground, there really aren't as many people to nab in 2, 4 years since the last two big elections.

- (2) Independents are making up a larger portion of registrations, and this is especially popular with younger generations.

- (3) We are about to see the largest crossover support from Republicans to Democrats in years with all these GOP endorsements of Harris. Registered Republican doesn't mean they're voting Trump.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I'm well aware that he might win and I'm personally preparing for it. With that in mind, I believe that PA is dems sole hope. If the whole Puerto Rico can move a few thousands votes more to the democrats camp then it's over for republicans.

I kinda feel that appealing to Never Trumpers was a mistake. You could have targeted independents with a similar ad and you could have gotten a more reliable voting group. Those republicans will never vote for a democrat.  

As for the Gaza and trans issue. I don't think they're as important, not even the left. Gaza could shift Michigan but Kamala should focus on PA and perhaps WI.  

Even if the worse were to happen, at least it's going to be a divided government. Democrats will likely take the house and even though republicans will get the senate they won't be able to do much.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"The predominantly Christian, white, town of Lynden, WA had loads of Trump signs in 2020 and when I was passing through a couple of weeks ago there were only a couple to be found. Saw just as many Harris signs in the county around Lynden. Not to say they won’t be voting red, but they are aren’t as comfortable about showing it now.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I served with a bunch of Puerto Ricans in the Army - which had a *long* tradition of territorial Americans serving, as well as foreign borne soldiers serving to earn their citizenship.

You want to find a motivated trooper, look no further than those guys. My favorite was a quiet Mexican trooper that spoke English with a heavy enough accent to be tough to understand. He was the most motivated, can-do trooper I ever had, and I was almost as excited as him and Command when he went down and aced his citizenship test.

To say those guys felt they'd earned their citizenship is an understatement.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"As I have pointed out repeatedly, Trump lost Independents by the summer of 2017 when it was clear his ""fiery campaign rhetoric"" wasn't ""just an act"" and there would be no ""presidential pivot"". He was given a chance and he blew it even before he blew the Covid response.

This time around, the Democrats can count on a surge in young voters, women voters, and now an October surprise bonus in Puerto Rican voters.

While the GQP can count on an increase in white males claiming they will vote for Trump (when they'll get around to it, ahem), that is unlikely to offset the drop in enthusiasm for Trump this time around (based on conviction fatigue and their general disillusionment after being bilked for scam after scam) and the fact that another large batch of his suckers will have died of old age (like they did by 2020 and with Covid).

Notice how, even with the presidential incumbency advantage, Trump lost in 2020 by 7 million votes. He's going to lose this time even worse this time around...

It's sort of like a resume - so long as you don't have any gaps, there aren't *that* many questions, and various (though sometimes complicated) ways to get there in the end.

"Many assumptions here:

470k Puerto Ricans of any age in PA. Since they’re US citizens, they’re all eligible to vote if they’re 18. 80% of Pennsylvanians are over 18, so that estimate is about 375,000.

Another estimate is that Puerto Ricans are 3.69% of the state, which has 8.9 million registered voters. If the proportions are the same, that’s about 326,000 adults.

It’s probably somewhere between those two numbers?

Edit: separately, there’s the interplay between Puerto Ricans being heavily Democratic already, with probably below average rates of political participation. So maybe a few tens of thousands of potential new votes here. Which isn’t a lot, but it doesn’t take a lot to matter.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I hope you're right but one has to have an open mind that he might as well win. I wonder, if Cruz would lose, could democrats hold the senate even by 1 seat?

Does that sound like the behavior of someone who never wanted to end Obamacare?",2024_11_02,05_26_36

What about the affordable care act?,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"

What a steaming pile of bullshit.

Trumps financial policies are projected to bankrupt Social Security in 6 years or less.

As president, Trump fought to repeal and undo the ACA using executive action, legislation and lawsuits.

On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order proclaiming: “It is the policy of my Administration to seek the prompt repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.”",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"There is every possibility that he's completely unaware that the Affordable Care Act and Obamacare are the same thing. But then, he also claimed that he never said 'Lock her up' about Hillary Clinton. Maybe he's just finally losing whatever was left of his chlamydia-addled mind.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"The plan is just say everything, so that someone looking to defend you can cherry pick the suitable quote depending on the timing and audience. 

Trump appears to hold all of these conflicting opinions at once because he has no opinions, on a fundamental level on almost every issue he simply does not care.

This is another instance of Trump taking both sides of an issue so Republicans can project what they want onto him to justify supporting him. They won't look at his actions (throwing a regular fit about McCain's vote) to see what he really means,2024_11_02,05_26_36

Yeah. No shit.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"A lot of what happened during the Trump Assministration has fallen into the memory hole, but this was one of their first major failures.

Republicans had campaigned for the better part of a decade on how the ACA was socialist and awful and needed to be taken down.

Of course, people don't like being given something and then having it be taken away. Republicans found this out in 2018 when even their constituents didn't want the ACA to go away entirely (they like provisions like coverage for people with preexisting conditions and being able to keep their kids on their insurance longer).

Trump in his lizard brain way saw this and promised that they wouldn't lose anything but that he would replace it with something that would magically improve services but decrease premiums.

It became clear, however, that he had no plan to do more for less and didn't even understand how the health care system worked (""who know health care could be so complicated""). Furthermore, he had zero ability to coordinate with House and Senate Republicans on this.

He wouldn't help or direct the work that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell were doing, but he would complain about it.

Here we are two election cycles later and all Trump has come up with is ""the concept of a plan"" for healthcare.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"He was going to because he thought it would help him, but John McCain put the kibosh on it (best thing the man ever did), but Trump didn't feel one way or the other about it.

Now he think it won't help him to kill the ACA, so he's jumping to say ""I didn't actually want to, I really didn't!"" and he might think it's the truest thing he's ever said, but it shows that he has no principles and will do and promise anything as long as he gets to be in charge",2024_11_02,05_26_36

That’s so fucking incredible that he would make that claim it’s truly spectacular. McCain burned him on that vote and there were dozens of votes in the house to repeal it. It’s so stupid of him to say that but what’s one more lie?,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Isn’t his plan still to end it?,2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Honestly, I don't think most MAGA voters know what the ACA does.

I'm serious about that.

In 2018, health care and the Republican effort to remove the ACA were big boosts for Democrats in retaking the House.

Republicans going home to their districts found constituents who didn't want things from the ACA yanked like coverage for people with preexisting conditions or the bigger age cap for children to be on their parents' insurance.

But only the imminent threat of those things being removed and not replaced or improved really motivated Republican voters to object.

Unless they are told ""this thing you have is about to be taken away from you"" then I don't think they care.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"As a former L&D nurse, and still a perinatal nurse, I don’t understand why they wouldn’t treat her sepsis regardless of the disposition of her pregnancy.

The EMR even automatically generates a warning and a note, based on vital signs that usually flow in automatically from monitors, that makes you acknowledge that you were informed that the woman is in danger, before you can do anything but log off. Nurses have to input who they notified of the “SAVEMOMS” score being actionable. 

Treatment for sepsis usually doesn’t require termination of a pregnancy for most of its components. And pregnant patients can be admitted to an ICU-happens all the time, even in hospitals that have L&D units. They just send an L&D nurse up periodically for whatever they need us for, or even sit one at the bedside continuously. Sometimes with a whole delivery set up including for an emergency C/S in a nearby room.

This has been happening for a hundred years at this point. Normally volunteer work, or low pay.

"> Isn’t that just like you’re not registered for one of the main parties? 

Pretty much.  Obviously we have two major parties but there are dozens of recognized political parties (Green, Libertarian, etc).  In some states, your party designation determines if you can vote in the primary elections but that varies by state.  If you don’t select a party, you’re defaulted to independent.  

Choosing a party also matters when it comes to public funding of campaigns, ballot access etc.   it’s confusing AF and we need to ditch voter party affiliation (and push for run off elections to give other parties fair access)",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"It depends on the state. Here in Oregon if you don't choose a party when you are registering to vote you are put in the independent party. It's not a real party but a designation. 

In some states you have to be in a major party to vote in primaries and in others everyone can vote in them. Some people game the system and change registration so they can vote for a bad candidate on the other side and then change back at a later date. 

Independent doesn't have a candidate who runs here in Oregon.  But remember, each state is different, they all have their own rules.  I'm a registered Democrat who is also a PCP. Which is a precinct committee person. I was on the ballot during the primaries.  This allows me to vote in the county Democratic party.  

If there is a vacancy in the state, for reasons such as death or they are tapped to be part of the presidential administration. I get to vote on a group of people who could replace them and they are sent to the governor. Independents aren't allowed to vote in that way.

Every state has pcps and national delegates that are elected. When they have the conventions, those people are voted on by their party and sent to vote for the state. And again, here in Oregon, independents are not allowed to vote in the nomination of either major party. 

This was a long answer and I have more to say, ask away if you have any questions.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

These states tend to have “open primaries” where anyone can vote in the democratic or republican primaries— but they can only vote in one.

An out of state canvassar isn't going to know about local polling stations, local programs to help people to vote, state laws on registering, etc.  And I'm certain America PAC canvassers can't text\call their organizer and ask these questions, if the canvassar spent 10 minutes talking to someone who leans Republican but doesn't have a way to get to the poll this election, that's 10 minutes they could have spent knocking on other people's doors to meet their quota.

The Hayes election was weird for a totally different reason: 4 states' election results were disputed due to widespread and fairly provable election fraud, a commission was appointed to decide who got those EVs, they agreed that all of them would go to Hayes, but in order to ratify him, per the convention of the time, of both the House and the Senate, Hayes, a Republican, agreed to end Reconstruction and pull out Union troops from the South, in return for the Democratic-majority House to ratify him.

"Honestly, the Democratic party’s messaging has failed big time if *they* of all parties can be considered socialist/communist in the eyes of so many people, but very specifically Hispanics.

My dad (Central American) is a hard Trump supporter and he called me an idiot for voting for Democrats off the basis of my identity (queer single issue voter), and then proceeded to tell me how our economy was going to finish collapsing under the Dems because they’re communists, and that it’s the exact same thing that happened to Venezuela. Then he dared me to go tell a Venezuelan to their face that I’m “a communist” (I’m not. I’m a socialist) and that Democrats aren’t that bad.

Funny thing is that I proceeded to walk up to my Venezuelan coworker later on and told her what my dad told me, and she told me he was full of shit lol

But it is demonstrably a failure that Democrats have never been able get over the “communist” allegations. Hell, I *wish* they veered closer toward communism than this weird current central-right fascist leaning they go into instead.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Well that’s partially true but the republicans and fox news especially are really good at brainwashing.  Your dad sounds much like a Fox News anchor.  The fear of everything and everyone that isn’t them is crazy.  You can point that historically dems have been much better for the economy but  even with tons of evidence and they’ll say it doesn’t matter.

"He’s specifically in the demographic of Republicans that own a small business and really give a shit about everything being self made. He worships people like Bezos, Musk, and Trump for being these hyperintelligent business magnates.

His specific grievances with Dems is that he thinks they’re the cause for the economy being so bad that he’s on the verge of having to shut his small business down. He hates the idea that Dems are trying to tax him higher and steal his money so they can give it out to lazy poor people from the hood. He’s very much an “economy first, everything else is irrelevant” kind of single issue voter (which is why he thinks I’m an idiot for being a single issue voter on queer issues)

What can I say? The propaganda machine got him hard considering that I also very much remember him as a saying out loud at an airport that GWB deserves to be assassinated, and then had a party and was so excited when Obama became president in 2008. Somewhere during the Obama years he took a hard swing right, which is on him, but I blame Democrats for such a disappointing 8 years of bullshit that they lost people like him to the right wing rabbit shithole.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

* If Kamala wins he will do everything in his power to get the results in front of the Supreme Court
* If the Supreme Court doesn't hand him the election then he will do everything in his power to create another January 6th

> Republicans are already laying the ground for rejecting the result of next week&#039;s US presidential election in the event Donald Trump loses, with early lawsuits baselessly alleging fraud and polls from right-leaning groups that analysts say may be exaggerating his popularity and could be used by Trump to claim only cheating prevented him from returning to the White House.

> &quot;We cannot be bamboozled by this again. It is vital to Donald Trump&#039;s effort if he tries to cheat and overturn the election results, he needs to have data showing that somehow he was winning the election.&quot;The reason we have to call this out is that Donald Trump needs to go into election day with some set of data showing him winning, so if he loses, he can say we cheated.

If Harris has a resounding majority in the popular vote, but it's close in the EC then we'll see this playbook enacted, and then the Dems have some hard choices to make for sure. They will have to do something though because MAGA will be essentially stealing the Presidency with the backing of enablers they appointed to make it happen.

Unfortunately it's a sad fucking shame that when a Democrat wins we have to keep fighting to ensure we actually win what we won, but if a Republican wins they think it was guaranteed from the start and threaten to cause a problem for whoever challenges their win.

It tells me that Republicans are terrified of losing all power and so they're completely comfortable with doing nearly anything it takes to maintain some power.

Nope. And my translation required barely any editing.

"Weird, isn't it? That Republicans never made any of these bullshit ""fraud"" claims for Romney....

Who Trump supporters voted for **uniformly** (literally in the previous election to Trump's run) before they ""found Trump"".

They never did this for McCain/Palin, they never did it for ANY Republican President **throughout the entire history of the party**.

Nope! it just so ""conveniently"" happens that only when Trump is running (apparently), ""voter fraud"" happens.

Of course, they're going to respond to such an estimation with ""Well obviously voter fraud was always a problem"", but then you can just respond to that with:

""Ya sure never acted like it was before, conveniently, right now. Seems awfully convenient that it's really only ever happened in (what they claim) disastrous amounts only when Trump became part of the political world. Seems awfully weird to claim voter fraud has always been some huge issue, but then **to not ""act like it"" until all of a sudden, in 2016, 2020 and 2024** there's a bigot, racist, sexist, rapist, fraud committing piece of shit that makes them laugh from jokes that have the substance and quality of a fart that's been trapped in a show for eons.

I suppose all the other Republican Presidents weren't racist *enough*, sexist *enough*, enough of a proven criminal; to have gained such fervor and such immediate surrender to morality and the breaking the law at record speeds.

They fucking wonder why people hate Trump so god damn much and thus; deduce that their supporters are likely worthless to get to know in person. As though it's some huge fucking mystery.

You know they’re all war hawks when they’re sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, oh gee, well let’s send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy,”

So the fact that it is clear it was war and how easy it is for someone to send others into harms way , not a firing squad, being referred means nothing?

As a reminder the war in Iraq was based on a pack of lies sold to the American public by politicians and while tens of thousands of people now live in daily misery based on those lies those that perpetrated that war live in extreme comfort on fat pensions.

I for one agree with Harris. I am not going back. But those have to be more than just words. Rising up means just that. The tactics of jumping on a poorly worded quote even when the context is clear is right out of the MAGA playbook, a playbook set on destroying our institutions including a free press.

When he says let's do it do you think he means just in imagination? Because I don't - It's part of a very long line of other threatening statements he has made over many years. He's also lying about her generally, but everyone's ignoring that part too. Was Trump just hypothetically suggesting that Hillary should be locked up? Because after all, he was just trying to say she couldn't be trusted due to her emails, right, if you take the statements in their broader context? Come on.

But you make a good point - everything he says paints a Rorschach image.  We then spend a news cycle or two debating what it means.  While we are doing that he drops another couple of dozen confusion bombs.  It’s exhausting. 

And there is a pattern to it.  The plain meaning is innocuous, but it’s full of allusions that his followers accept as gospel.  The plain meaning makes it easy for his lawyers to keep him out of jail, but the dog whistling sends clear direction to his followers.  It’s the mob boss pattern.

My main point is that all of this is con-artist misdirection.  We should all pay attention to the big picture.  Trump and the GOP are attempting the greatest haul of any con in history.   Cheney’s “crime” is calling them on it.  

The story is that she is one of his targets, not who is going to pull the trigger.  The media ought to dig into why he has her singled out for special attention.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Unlike incitement to terrorism, stochastic terrorism is accomplished with indirect, vague or coded language, which grants the instigator plausible deniability for any associated violence.[1] A key element of stochastic terrorism is the use of media for propagation, where the person carrying out the violence may not have direct connection to any other users of violent rhetoric.

"Indulgence in women is cheap - high class escorts are like $1k/hour, literally penny change for billionaires.  Expensive Slovenian long-term prostitutes like Melania are, realistically, $250k+visa costs+prenupt costs prostitutes.  Billionaires are not interested in just having consensual relations with beautiful women, because that is within the reach of every millionaire.

No.  What billionaires want is *non-consensual* relations with women, and especially unlawfully young women.  That is something that the U.S. is still keen to shut down (particularly when teens/children are involved), so it is currency for the Trumps and Epsteins of the world. The U.S. says you can't rape women or children, so that is what these billionaires want to do.

Note that it isn't *every* billionaire.  Some rich people like Buffet and Gates are content with just having money and spending it on projects that they want to move forward.  But that is really actual work - Gates donates a lot of his time to his foundation to give his money away to ensure that it is used wisely.

Other rich people are not as sophisticated as Bill Gates.  They might have billions, but they don't have original thoughts, plans with what they want to do with their power, and often any education at all.  This is the class of people who got rich through a one-time windfall, a soaring crypto investment, or inheritance, etc.  Elon might fit into this class, for example, because he is a person with absolutely nothing interesting to say - and a burning desire to say it into every microphone he can.

">Another point of proof that Harris has the momentum is where Trump and Harris are heading in the closing days. This weekend, Trump will head back to North Carolina for an event in Gastonia and another in Greensboro. On Sunday, he will be headed to Kinston. Finally, on Monday, he will hold a rally in Raleigh, the capital of the Tar Heel state.

>Trump and his running mate JD Vance have gone all-in on North Carolina, the one swing state Trump won in 2020. Trump did four events there last week and slammed Biden and Harris on the response to Hurricane Helene. This should be the state where they feel most secure. Instead, the campaign finds itself shoring up its support there.

Cuban’s knowledge of Trump is based on a mixx of **business ** acquaintance, **public** interactions, and at times, rivalry, **but never one-one one private time…**

Mark Cuban, a billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, first encountered Trump in the early 2000s when both were prominent figures in the business and media worlds. Trump and Cuban crossed paths as outspoken, high-profile personalities, with Cuban being especially active in sports and business commentary, while Trump expanded his brand through “The Apprentice” reality TV series .

During Trump’s presidency (2016–2020), Cuban became an outspoken critic of Trump’s policies and leadership style. Cuban, who at times hinted at a possible run for office, voiced strong opinions against Trump’s approach to various issues. Trump, in turn, responded with public statements, leading to occasional public exchanges of criticism between the two  . 

**None of this Qualified s Cuban’s opinion as anything more than “anecdotal.”**

"I’m not either, but I’m cautiously hopeful. Trump’s base was never the majority and since 2020 it has only gotten smaller. January 6th and his felony conviction turned off “reasonable” republicans (how reasonable they are is up for debate), and Trump has done nothing to win democrats to his side. He’s spent the past four years demonizing democrats, and very few Dems will vote for him. On the other hand, lots of republicans will vote for Harris, or skip voting all together. On top of that, Trump killed a lot of his supporters by failing to manage Covid.

Basically Trump has been bleeding support with no real stoppage. People can try to claim there will be an influx of new republican voters, but really? Do you really think people who didn’t vote for him last time will see this clearly dementia addled man and decide now’s the time to become politically engaged? I don’t.

He definitely could still win, but I think our country will put this dumb orange motherfucker to rest, for good this time (though I would love if GOP tried to run an 82 y/o, it’s not like his cognitive decline will get better)",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"*From Bloomberg News reporter* [*Maggie Eastland*](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AW4Bhiwn1Ms/maggie-eastland)*:*

Days before a neck-and-neck presidential race, pump prices — one of the most salient data points consumers use to gauge inflation — are tumbling in key swing states.

In Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona, retail fuel prices have fallen at least 20% since the 2022 midterm election, according to the four-week averages of data from AAA. Nationwide, prices are down 17% while, in the battleground states of Georgia and Pennsylvania, they’ve fallen 11% and 16%, respectively.

In Nevada, drivers are paying roughly $3.80 a gallon compared to more than $5 before the midterm elections. In Arizona, where prices have fallen more than a dollar per gallon since the midterms, Republicans flipped two congressional seats in 2022.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

The entire MAGA focus on “bringing prices down” is foolish. They should be pushing for better pay and a competitive free market rather than tariffs and market manipulation. Anyone who has worked in sales knows prices rarely go back down. It’s more logical to push revenue/income UP.

Depending on the gas, it reaches from a \~12.45% decrease (regular) to a \~19.72% decrease (premium).

""Trump plan would drive up inflation"" doesn't capture how truly destructive Trump's masters' plans are.

The Trump administration's plans would be brutally disastrous for the economy (let alone everything else):

Musk's intentional crashing of the economy and the following austerity, Trump's economically self-defeating tariffs and the trade wars they will spiral up, mass deportation devastating entire industries (and these industries are essential to our survival since, food and all), the massive social upheaval from Project 2025, and the civil war that would likely erupt if Trump turned the army on American citizens...

The devastation on all of our day to day lives would be truly dystopian.

Her parents are both immigrants, but both well accomplished and she was raised upper-middle class in California.  They are privileged and wealthy so it makes sense that she'd see herself as one of the ""good"" immigrants and is in the ""in crowd"" being married to a white-conservative-christian MAGA man.

That's how the us-vs-them mentality generally works for demographics that any sort of fascistic group targets.  In this case, MAGA targeting women or ""poor"" minorities means that folks like Usha are outside that targeted demographic and feel safe being in the ""in crowd"".  

They don't worry about that stuff because they're wealthy and this doesn't impact them today and can pay their way out of any inconvenience.  Like, if a national total abortion ban passed the wealthy MAGAs don't give a shit because they can fly out to another country or pay a private doctor to keep it a secret if they needed an abortion.  They can pay the massive legal fees to expedite any immigration issues they may have on their visa.  They aren't impacted by ""poor people problems"".  The Trad-Wives don't care because they believe being a subservient spouse is their calling in life.

When even a unit of measurement endorses a presidential candidate.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
The amount of former Trump officials coming out against him is frankly astounding.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Half a Scaramucci before election day!,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Scaramucci is my favorite character on this show. He had a whole ass ARC.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Mooch, you're awful too, but good for you on this one.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
You know the trump show is entering its final season when they start bringing in characters from season 1 for the finale.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Best comment Mooch ever made was that he is not a “back stabber” but a “front stabber”. The guy is truly funny.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
The Mooch is loose!,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Bah gawd it's THE MOOCHS music!!!,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"You could see this coming as he tried to defend Trump on the rest is politics USA podcast. He had a more complex and challenging time coming up with a point that made sense. He also works on wall street, and in his last podcast, he hinted that a lot of people could lose a lot of money if the trump tariffs happened. You could just hear him realising he was backing the wrong horse. Its been a long time coming but it is notbunepexted, the mooch effectively reasoned himself outbof backing trump",2024_11_02,05_26_36
He should have done so Oct 26th,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I have trouble believing that Scaramucci's endorsement is going to alter anyone's vote. Yes, some people might be convinced by people in the Trump orbit saying he was bad, but who is going to change their mind now from this when Kelly and about half of Trump's cabinet have already said it?",2024_11_02,05_26_36
Don’t count your mooches until they’re hatched,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Going to use this thread to plug a politics podcast I’ve really enjoyed in recent months, “The Rest is Politics US”, which is hosted by Anthony Scaramucci and BBC Washington Correspondent Katty Kay. Good analysis, very enjoyable and the Mooch adds a lot of insight on Donald Trump from his personal experiences of Trump.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"So no one from Trumps former campaign endorses him. Sounds like he should not have the highest office in the country. Wonder what he’s already given to Russia, China, Iran.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Mooch, get into the Democrats Big Tent quarantine zone with Michael Bloomberg and Bill Marr",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Finally, the Mooch has weighed in. It’s been well over 140 mooches ago since we last saw him in action",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"No offense to the Mooch but it seems like a lot of folks waited to see those early vote numbers to endorse. None of it matters, WE ARE HIS JURY. VOTE!",2024_11_02,05_26_36
I love the rest is politics US podcast. He gives such good dirt on trump,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Scaramooch Scaramooch will you do the Fandango?,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Scaramucci won me over with his vivid picture of Steve Bannon’s hobby,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Mooch is mooching for relevancy. I’ll take the endorsement if it helps though. He’s a goofy little guy.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
The Mooch will always be funny to me. Bro spent like a week doing a job and is more memorable than half the white house staff at the time.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Considering how he consistently treated his people and how regularly he stabbed them in the back, it probably shouldn't be.  About the only thing he values is being completely loyal to him.  If anyone questioned him on anything or pushed back on his insane shit, no matter how mildly, they were out on their asses or thrown under the garbage truck, so most of his former people probably either saw something they couldn't accept or don't want to deal with the consequences for.  Him being a bad boss is nothing new, we've known that for decades, and he took that to the presidency.  Turns out that just like in any other job, treating your employees like shit ensures they'll tell everyone exactly how bad you were when the shoe's on the other foot.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"And swayed no one. Only the best, but some crazy numbers, like 270, were fired, and almost every single one has spoken out against him. Even those not fired have spoken out against him. It's insanity.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
Metric or Imperial?,2024_11_02,05_26_36
This is like the Mooch coming back for the pre-season finale,2024_11_02,05_26_36
I can't help but like the guy. I don't know why. I just am a fan of the Mooch.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"You’re free to think that of course, but Anthony Scaramucci has been pretty relentless in campaigning against Trump since his very brief stint in his administration. He’s been active as a Harris surrogate for a while. I highly recommend the podcast series “The Rest is Politics US”, which he hosts together with BBC Washington correspondent, Katty Kay. I really enjoy his analyses and his self deprecating sense of humor, and he has really good takes on Trump’s psychology.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
My thoughts exactly,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"He did a very nice Cameo video for a friend's birthday so while he may have been politically misguided in his past, I don't get 'awful' vibes.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"I mean I’ll take any vote, but this is a continuation of his desperate attempt to stay relevant.  If he ever was.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
He’d be part of trumps new administration if they let him,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"It might sway a small number of Staten Island voters, so it might make a difference in one Congressional district... but who knows? Control of the House might come down to a single vote",2024_11_02,05_26_36
And people a lot more credible than the mooch.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"On the last podcast with Katy he said he had been canvassing in PA, and believed he had swayed around 10 Trump voters to reconsider.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"To be fair, Mooch has backed Harris for a long time. He was in the spin room for Harris after the debate.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
Can't forget about Spicer lying about the inauguration crowd size & then hiding in a hedge before swiping a microwave from the breakroom.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Here’s a really good interview where he mentions his short tenure with the administration.  https://youtu.be/QEp06Ngulbo?si=Q_s-BnDaFrstULkM,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Bond villain name,2024_11_02,05_26_36

"I was from the beginning- he had a vibe. 

Maybe that vibe was “cool person trying to come out of douchebag” … who knows?",2024_11_02,05_26_36
Ditto,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"He's that friend that was solid as a kid but you wouldn't want your sister dating him as an adult, money changed him too much but not so much he's a total loss.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"+1 for this, it's a great show",2024_11_02,05_26_36
Yup. Quality podcast.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Wow he performed for a 60 second paid ad what a great guy,2024_11_02,05_26_36
"He's put his shoulder to the wheel on this one, to give him his due. Been out door knocking trumpers trying to sway them as well as being a talking head.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"Oh, he'll always be relevant. Every now and then I convert time to Mooches",2024_11_02,05_26_36
The SNL “Spicey” skit is amazing. “He will not be de-turd.”,2024_11_02,05_26_36
Remember Spicey sold his fucking soul and went on DWTS too.,2024_11_02,05_26_36
I agree.,2024_11_02,05_26_36

"He'll declare victory just like he lies about everything else. No one will give a shit but his cultists and the real world will move along.

Almost time for Malaria to buy him that Fisher Price Oval Office playset and plop his sundowning shitty ass down in front of it.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
"100%, there will be fuckery happening come November 5th, January 6th, and the weeks in between:

Mark my words, Trump will:

- Declare himself as winner ASAP

- encourage chaos, violence, and unwarranted anger 

- encourage intervention into official processes (like stopping the count or blocking certification, getting in the way at voting stations) 

- question everything (how did we lose if our polls show we are tied?)

- greatly attempt to get the final decisions into the hands of SCOTUS

- create fraud if there is no fraud to be found

- lie and make shit up 

... And probably more too.

Edit:... And that's just Trump. imagine what House and Senate members will say and try to do. They will pull out all the stops, ignore the environment and help passively take advantage of the situation, as opportunists. The amount of bullshit the usual Republican House and Senate members will throw will be plentiful.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

My overdose of hopium is that they don’t just have like a political level plan but like a national security level plan that just checkmates every legal venue for overturning the election while also preventing any potential revolution.

"Reminder that Donald Trump was found to be a sexual abuser by a jury of his peers in May 2023. Then, when Trump twice appealed the ruling claiming he was “only” a sexual abuser and not rapist, the judge twice clarified that he was a rapist according to the common and federal law definitions of rape.

"Ever since Biden dropped out, Trump’s campaign has slowly but surely been going off the rails. After the first assassination attempt and the RNC, Trump looked poised to win bigly. And it showed in how relatively composed he was. At least compared to how unhinged he is now.

And it makes sense. Once Harris took over and started stealing the spotlight from him, Trump started getting agitated. Then the debate happened, and he was spanked so handily that he probably suffered a severe narcissistic injury. It’s all been downhill from there. His usual handlers seemingly got replaced by yes-men who enabled his basest instincts.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"> Seemingly overnight, Donald Trump and his MAGA followers have gone from “We got this election” to the shocking reality that it’s probably slipping from their grasp — and they’re freaking out.
> 
> But, remember: It’s not just another presidential election for Trump, who already has lost one. A defeat by Vice President Kamala Harris means Trump will spend months in court before possibly spending years in prison — if he doesn’t flee the country first.
> 
> And those realities have released his anger and violent fantasies — of executing generals who aren’t loyal to him, imprisoning his political opponents whom he calls “the enemy from within,” and assassinating former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, who is working diligently to make sure Trump loses.
> 
> According to MSNBC political analyst John Heilemann, who spoke on Morning Joe on Friday, voters are seeing the real Trump — an aging 78-year-old man in physical and mental decline who is revealing the last bits of his crudeness. Age and panic, he said, are pulling the curtain wide open.
> 
> “You know, one of the things we talk sometimes about Trump’s age, and how in some of his various infirmities and the mental acuity that’s declined so dramatically,” he said. “But there’s one other aspect of what happens to a lot of people, at least as they get older, which is that their true nature comes out more. You meet a lot of people in their 80s, and they are whatever they are, they get boiled down to their essence, in some sense.
> 
> “It’s always good to keep in mind that the stakes for Donald Trump losing this race are likely imprisonment, and we know ... one of the things he’s most afraid of — most nakedly, openly afraid of his entire life — has been the prospect of spending time behind bars.”
> 
> Heilemann said Trump likely is being triggered by early-voting data, which shows women are voting in massive numbers, which bodes well for Harris. Polling, too, seems to be shifting more in her favor.
> 
> “Panic is setting in,” Heilemann said. “This is the projection of a violent, dark fantasy he’s imagining. And in some sense, he’s kind of getting off on the image, the idea, of Liz Cheney being put in front of a bunch of weapons and having them shot at her. And I think that is ... the essence of who he is coming out.”

So if they are both the same on that issue, then we have to look at other issues.

Will Kamala or Trump be better for your friends and loved ones? Will Kamala or Trump be closer to your personal ideals? Will Kamala or Trump very more willing to listen in the future? Which one is more likely to cause more damage geopolitically?

You can hate Kamala for not being strong against Netenyahu, but we have a choice between 2 candidates.

> For the families of the close to 100 hostages still held captive in Gaza - about half of whom are now presumed dead - our last shred of hope depends on the election of an American president who can successfully pressure both Israel and Hamas to make a deal that brings the hostages home and ends the enormous suffering caused by this war.

> President Joe Biden&#039;s administration, with Harris&#039; support, has been tireless in its efforts to secure a deal that would ensure the release of the remaining hostages - one that would involve an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza without allowing Hamas to come back to power - and I trust Harris to see it through.

> Throughout his campaign, he has expressed no plan at all for how to get the hostages released, and has only made empty threats that their captors will &quot;Pay&quot; if they are not returned.

What they do is they spend years organizing across multiple countries, get their favored representatives elected, and continue spreading their influence so much so that both parties in the US basically compete to show who is more pro-Israel. They don't protest vote, they don't abstain, they dive deeper into the political muck and do what it takes to have the power. 

Leftists should learn from that to affect change for Palestine and for other worthy causes like the environment. The US Green Party is a great other example of all flash and no substance.

First, your initial statement of him killing 1 million people with covid is not only irrational, the number isn’t even remotely accurate.

[Covid deaths in the US](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)

If you scroll down on that link, you can see that the rate of deaths from covid in the US remained consistent up until march 2022. I’ll restate this for you, the rate of covid deaths under Biden/harris has been no different than the number under trump. Which is kinda odd considering the vaccine has been available for nearly the entirety of Biden’s term.

"For those that do hear of it, it fans the flame of hatred towards trans people, and by extension, all LGBTQ people. Because of a cultural shift, it is no longer as effective to just attack gay men, so they chose an even more minority group to isolate and spread misinformation about.  This is very similar to the previous rhetoric about gay men being pedophiles. Spreading lies to incite hatred towards minorities works as a way of gaining support from a certain, uneducated segment of the population. They use the exact same techniques to spread racism vitriol (foreigners are eating pets and stealing our jobs, immigrants are all murderers and rapist, etc.). It is about speaking to an “us vs. them” animal-instinct in us all, with the “them” always being anyone who looks or acts differently.

More mainstream, educated and affluent followers, discount the dog whistles, or cognitively distance themselves from it. Many of them live, work, and worship in clinically homogeneous “bubbles” where there aren’t many minorities to challenge the status quo. Many churches and places of worship, for example, often consist of ethnically similar individuals. These people aren’t disturbed by the rhetoric, because it doesn’t challenge anything they experience in their “real world”.  

This is also why those living in urban areas tend to be more liberal, as they are surrounded by examples of minorities. It is difficult to maintain racists attitudes when evidence against it surrounds you everywhere you go.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

Another good thing he’s done ,2024_11_02,05_26_36
">Today [October 29th], President Biden will travel to the Port of Baltimore to announce a $3 billion investment from his Inflation Reduction Act to improve and electrify port infrastructure, support an estimated 40,000 good-paying and union jobs, reduce pollution, and combat the climate crisis.  The announcement includes $147 million in awards for the Maryland Port Administration, which will support over 2,000 good-paying and union jobs by enabling the purchase and installation of zero-emission port equipment, charging infrastructure, and power improvements. During the visit, President Biden will highlight how his Investing in America agenda is making an historic impact on communities and workers in Baltimore and across the country.

*$3 Billion Investment to Strengthen Port Infrastructure*

>Today, President Biden is announcing $3 billion in Environmental Protection Agency Clean Ports grants, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, to 55 selectees across 27 states and territories, including $147 million in implementation and planning grants for the Maryland Port Administration. The nation’s ports are the lynchpin of our nation’s supply chains and employ over 100,000 union workers across the United States.

>This funding will protect and create good-paying and union jobs and better working conditions by upgrading port operations and infrastructure to cleaner equipment, while ensuring cleaner air for port workers and nearby communities. The Clean Ports program will support an estimated 40,000 jobs across the economy, including over 6,500 manufacturing jobs, and is expected to increase demand for American manufactured electric cargo handling equipment at least six-fold over the life of the program.

>While a major economic driver, our nation’s ports are a major source of pollution for workers and surrounding communities. Communities living near ports and other transportation corridors are exposed to toxic pollution which can cause respiratory and cardiovascular harm, especially in children. The Clean Ports program will improve air quality at ports across the country by installing clean, zero-emission freight and ferry technologies along with associated infrastructure, eliminating more than 3 million metric tons of carbon pollution over the first ten years of implementation, equivalent to 391,220 homes’ energy use for one year. The funds announced today will support the purchase of battery-electric and hydrogen-powered human-operated and human-maintained equipment, including over 1,500 units of cargo handling equipment, 1,000 drayage trucks, 10 locomotives, and 20 vessels, as well as shore power systems for ocean-going vessels, battery-electric and hydrogen vehicle charging and fueling infrastructure, and solar power generation. The Clean Ports program advances the President’s Justice40 Initiative and aligns with the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal for a zero-emission freight sector.

*Investing in the Port of Baltimore*

>President Biden will announce the funding at the Port of Baltimore in Maryland. The Port of Baltimore is one of the busiest ports on the East Coast and is a major hub for the import and export of vehicles. More than 20,000 workers support daily Port operations, including unionized longshoreman and truckers. Each day the Port’s economic impact represents $192 million or more than $70 billion a year, representing 13% of Maryland’s gross domestic product.

>The Maryland Port Administration’s Equipment Electrification and Terminal Decarbonization project has been selected to receive over $145 million to purchase zero-emission cargo handling equipment and drayage trucks and facilitate the transition of the port to a zero-emission facility, as well as a nearly $2 million planning grant to help the port chart a path to greater emissions reductions in the future, delivering cleaner air for the port and neighboring communities. The port is a major economic engine for the region, providing thousands of jobs and contributing billions of dollars to the local economy—and this new investment will support over 2,000 jobs, including more than 350 manufacturing jobs.

*Creating Good Paying, Union Jobs in Baltimore and Across the Country*

>President Biden is the most pro-union president in history. He’s the first and only president to walk a picket line, and under his Administration, unions have secured historic labor wins. Last month, President Biden signed an Executive Order that calls on agencies to promote strong labor standards such as family-sustaining wages, workplace safety, and the free and fair choice to join a union, and encourages agencies to implement these standards through their Investing in America programs. This builds on a record of pro-worker accomplishments throughout the Biden-Harris Administration. For example:

>* Workers are filing for union representation at twice the rate they were at the start of the Biden-Harris Administration—the first Administration in five decades to have an increase in union petitions. In Maryland, union petitions increased by 55% percent. The National Labor Relations Board has met this historic moment by reducing unnecessary delays in union representation elections and by expanding remedies available to workers when their employers engage in unionbusting.
* The vast majority of Investing in America programs require grantees to pay Davis-Bacon prevailing wages for workers. The Administration also published the first update to Davis-Bacon prevailing wages in nearly 40 years, which will increase pay for one million construction workers over time.
* The Department of the Treasury finalized a rule implementing prevailing wage and apprenticeship bonus credits for certain clean energy projects funded by the President’s Inflation Reduction Act to ensure clean energy workers are paid good wages and that these projects create equitable pipelines to these good jobs.

*Building on Historic Investments in Maryland’s Infrastructure and Economy*

>Today’s announcement builds on a historic investment in the state of Maryland under the Biden-Harris Administration. To date, the Investing in America agenda has delivered over $13 billion for over 970 projects in Maryland, spurring over $3 billion in private sector investments.  
...  
Baltimore was also named an Investing in America Workforce Hub, where the Administration is bringing together industry, government, educators, non-profits and unions to help workers in Maryland access good jobs created by private and public sector investments in the state. In November 2023, Hub partners announced new efforts to train and hire local residents to support major infrastructure projects. These commitments include one from the State of Maryland to incorporate a Project Labor Agreement in the bidding process for nine projects covering $9 billion in investment and 11,000 jobs—including 7,000 construction jobs. One of these commitments includes Amtrak promising to invest at least $5 million in funding received through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to create recruitment and training programs for new jobs for Baltimore residents as part of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel Program.  
...

*The Biden-Harris Administration’s Ongoing Support for Baltimore*

>President Biden was last in Baltimore in the immediate aftermath of the tragic collapse of the Francis Scott Key bridge, which claimed the lives of six construction workers and closed ship traffic in and out of the Port of Baltimore. There, he said his Administration would move heaven and earth to reopen the Port of Baltimore as quickly as possible to support Maryland’s workers and economy. A Unified Command led by the United States Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers cleared 50,000 tons of wreckage from the channel, allowing the Port to fully reopen 78 days after the bridge collapse. The Department of Labor and Small Business Administration mobilized quickly to support workers and small businesses impacted by the port closure, including thousands of Longshoremen and Teamsters who rely on the port for their livelihood. And the Department of Transportation and the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force worked to limit supply chain disruptions, keep costs down, and ensure cargo quickly returned to the Port once it reopened. Today, port workers are back on the job, once again moving more than 100,000 tons of cargo per day.

>The President also committed to rebuilding the bridge as quickly as possible. Thanks to close collaboration with the Department of Transportation, Maryland is on the fast track to rebuild the bridge. In July, the Federal Highway Administration issued a Categorical Exclusion, allowing the project to clear a critical permitting milestone. And in August, Maryland selected a contractor to design and build the new bridge.  Immediately following the bridge collapse, President Biden called on Congress to fully fund the replacement bridge and his Administration reiterated this request in July.

>The Biden-Harris Administration also committed to holding the owners of the DALI cargo ship accountable for the disaster. Just last week, the Department of Justice announced a settlement of over $100 million with the owners of the DALI to cover federal government costs incurred in responding to the collapse. While the State of Maryland continues to pursue a separate lawsuit for damages incurred to the local economy, community, and families impacted by the collapse, the Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to working with Baltimore and the State of Maryland to ensure the city’s long-term recovery and success.",2024_11_02,05_26_36

"Given that Biden has full immunity with official acts, maybe it’s time to use it full force on his way out. Jail every single traitor that does not protest peacefully, and send them strait to GITMO while they wait for trial on domestic terrorism charges. Send the officials who participate in the inciting rallies along with them. Host public trials broadcasted on every channel exposing all evidence of their coordination behind the scenes. Text messages, emails, encrypted communication they thought was secret which really isn’t. All them Ginni Thomas like texts for example. No redactions, just raw evidence displaying the corruption behind the curtain. Arrest the SC justices involved in the tyranny on fraud, tax evasion and RICO charges. Any militias that are found to be involved in any violent attack should be taken down and rounded up just as Ghouliani did with the mafias in NYC. Any law enforcement that fail to uphold the law are stripped of their jobs, their immunity, lose their pension, and go on leave without pay. Any church that preaches any gospel with a hint of political commentary gets their tax exempt status immediately revoked.  Above may sound extreme, but IDK maybe it’s simply enforcing the laws that are in place against those who believe they don’t apply because they’re rich or privileged?

The whole party needs to be burned to the ground— beyond that look at every single horrible decision against facts and rationality this country has made in the last 54 years and look up who made that choice. Now SCOTUS is part of it and not even having to fake their legitimacy. Don’t like money in politics? Maybe understand that the GOP justices tied to the federalist society, heritage foundation, state policy network are the ones who allowed it. The “democrat” justices, who were really just objective, pushed against it. This can be said for almost every controversial decision we’ve seen that the legal community scoffs at for throwing out precedent since citizens united.

People need to understand that SCOTUS is corrupt and the immunity decision was so that the GOP can take and hold power indefinitely via any means necessary under the guise of an “official act.” If the GOP (any of them— including Mike Johnson who would become president as the Speaker of the House if the election is contingent/count is delayed by states) get into the presidency before the Dems have the house, senate and presidency to reform the court— we lose our democracy.

"Gore won the election, the Supreme Court stole it for bush and bush’s legal team got paid in their own Supreme Court appointments for their efforts. Multiple other third party candidates also got more votes than the difference between bush and gore after that decision. Putting all the blame on Nader is an excuse. I strongly disagree with his decision to contest the general instead of taking over the Democratic Party from within via the primary process - but pretending Jill stein is in any way equivalent to him is giving Jill stein way way way too much credit. Nader was frustrated with the lack of support from the Democratic Party on key issues after decades of effective service and driving support for important legislation, exposing corrupt corporate interests, and ran on real issues. Jill stein is an incompetent grifter that is specifically trying to defeat Kamala for her handlers.

Nader didn’t throw away his life’s work, his life’s work is still responsible for so many consumer and worker protections. He was vilified partly because he was so effective at holding corporate special interests accountable and could easily have had immense political power if he wanted it during the height of his popularity - when the car companies tried to destroy him for exposing their intentionally unsafe vehicles.

This is key to explain to stein supporters - she is NOT a dedicated person with a history of fighting for issues she believes in and driving meaningful legislation that makes the world better. She is NOT the candidate your conscience tells you to vote for, and Kamala is not a compromise. Jill stein is the left’s version of trump - not really left at all but cosplaying it for personal gain and eagerly grifting her supporters while Russians and republicans strategists fund her campaign.",2024_11_02,05_26_36
