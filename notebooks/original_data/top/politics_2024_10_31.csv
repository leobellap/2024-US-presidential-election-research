">The attorneys wrote that after Krasner filed his suit on Monday, Musk in a post on his social media site X noted his agreement with a user’s claim that the district attorney knows the $1 million daily giveaway is “not illegal but wants a leftist judge to stop it before Election Day.”

>Krasner’s lawyers asked that the judge order enhanced security for the hearing, which was originally scheduled for Friday morning, noting that one X account had posted the prosecutor’s home address and wrote, “Krasner loves visitors. Mask up and leave all cellphones at home.”

Setting aside partisan politics as much as possible - this is not the type of society we want to live in. 

We don’t want to live in fear of mobs of neighbors influencing law enforcement. We don’t want wealthy or famous people using their influence in the media to sway the justice system in their own cases.

He's clearly a sadist at a minimum and has no heart. He honestly believes he deserves all that he has acquired and has no perspective on luck, capitalism, regulation (or lack there of), the tens of thousands of people that have helped him get what he has..etc. 

Plus being a racist authoritarian loser that believes rule for thee, not for me. That's at the core of what I find so distasteful in rich republicans. They shamelessly buy their way through rules and laws yet constantly pretend that every other rule and the status quo should always be the same and that anyone else's plight is due to their failures.

The police apparently was in parts in on it, and routinely refused to enforce the law against those SA ""Schlägertrupps""/organized goon squads. Oh, and the justice system itself was sympathetic and amenable to Hitler and his ideas, which is why he got an early release from prison after his first insurrection attempt.

"Just to add some legal color...

Musk has modified this scheme multiple times, so crime depends on what he was doing on a given day.  Some days it seemed to be an election bribe scheme, some days a fraudulent payment for one day of “work” as a Trump spokesperson, some days an illegal lottery. 

It’s a crime for the “winner” to take an election bribe, but it’s not necessarily a crime to be the recipient of the illegal lottery funds.  As for being the “spokesperson” who receives the fraudulently oversized payment for one day of work, it would probably depend on whether the person is deemed to have been knowingly engaged in misrepresenting the value of the work.  

As for the IRS, whether the payment they receive is legal or illegal, they still have to pay tax.  It’s not that well known, but IRS is about collecting taxes, not as much about enforcing other laws.

Yeah, but in those cases, the ""no purchase necessary"" case are people taking advantage of a loophole. The companies offering the the sweepstakes are *hoping* people enter by buying the bottle of soda and checking the cap. The people mailing in for an entry are just something they put up because enough people are buying the soda to make it worthwhile. 

Here, getting people's addresses and phone numbers he can spam with electioneering communications is the whole point. That's why Musk is doing this. Collecting people's contact info isn't just some beauricratic necessity to administer a sweepstakes to get people to buy soda, it's the only thing he wants.

But, yeah, it's definitely not the strongest case, despite Reddit calls to deport him over this.

The companies offering the the sweepstakes are hoping people enter by buying the bottle of soda and checking the cap. The people mailing in for an entry are just something they put up because enough people are buying the soda to make it worthwhile. 

The ""no purchase necessary"" thing is about *the company running it* using a loophole, not the people entering the contest. The super simplified legal logic is that as long as there's a way to enter for free, it's not a lottery. (I don't think we're disagreeing here, just wanted to make sure that info was clear)

But there's nothing (besides morals, privacy policies, etc) specifically stopping those other companies from using the entries as marketing data, and it seems naive to think they aren't likely doing so anyways. In that aspect, he doesn't seem to be doing anything tangibly different legally. Arguing otherwise seems like an impossibly high bar to reach, and even then would be entirely based on speculation about motive unless there's a smoking gun somewhere. 

>Do you have a link to the lawsuit? I couldn't find it yesterday. I'm going off this quote from it I saw in a CNBC that seems to be their rationale in classifying it as a lottery (where you have to offer something of value to enter) and a sweepstakes (where you don't).

I was going off of the text of the OP's article, where it quotes the argument at the bottom. 

But this would reclassify virtually ***ALL*** sweepstakes as lotteries, and that seems like a reach for what this case is about. I can't think of a situation where customer data ***isn't*** valuable to a company to some degree, so you can't just set the bar there. And would open the door to a massive amount of tangentially related cases arguing about whether or not contact information counts as payment in any number of different situations. 

>But obviously, even if the court decide it is a sweepstakes, they can still get in trouble for running an illegal sweepstakes.

Agreed, he's clearly doing ***something*** wrong here, I just don't believe ""Having to identify yourself to enter counts as payment, so it's not free to enter"" holds any water.

"> All these polls have a margin of error of about 5%. So essentially from Harris’ perspective, Pennsylvania could be -5 to +5

You're leaving out an important part as well: That margin of error only applies **if the survey were to be repeated with the same methodology.**

That's all that margin of error means. It doesn't necessarily indicate that the methodology is correct, merely that if you were to repeat with a different sample but the same methodology, you would get the same result +/- 5%.

I'm not calling you out in particular, but I do want to piggyback on your comment to mention that a common misconception about ""margin of error"" is that it somehow reflects the ""true"" results, +/- the MOE. That isn't what the MOE is measuring.

That's also why (in normal circumstances) a ""poll of polls"" is going to be more accurate, because it's blending multiple methodologies together. Some will be more accurate than others. There's a chance that _none_ of the methodologies are accurate, in which case there's very likely going to be a big polling miss.

But it's a bit disingenuous to say ""we know from this poll that Pennsylvania could be -5 to +5"" - the true number _could_ be anywhere, what it's actually saying is that if you were to repeat the poll you'd usually get a result in the range of +5 to -5. That's not the whole ballpark generally speaking, that's just the range of results you'd get if you conducted the study dozens of times.

There might be (will be) other threats to our experiment, but there is no combination of headspace currently presented (and hopefully never again in our lifetimes) that functions like he does, that could grift like he does. And it is specifically because he holds this Kramer-like kavorka duality where he is simultaneously fully aware that he is conning people, and (at that same moment) totally buying into his own shtick. 

He is an entertainer extraordinaire. And we love our circuses. I had forgotten how entertaining he was, having refused to watch him live so much of these eight years.

Simply put:  Trump has to get beat in his own game, while playing by his rules.  

Only then will his base even have a chance to start recovering from the brainwashing they’ve ingested for however many years…. And then only maybe.

Kamala has done it since day one:  her policy positions make her the adult in the room, and this country needs that adult more than we collectively understand.

And if he wins he will turn democracy off. We all know it. He’s basically doing it now, as much as he can get away with. He’s only operating within the system as much as he absolutely has to.

The US needs an urgent review of the timescales involved, and the penalties for, in being prosecuted for this type of activity.

What I'm more worries about Tuesday though is the potential for violence and domestic terrorism on election day. I am absolutely certain there are supporters of his out there who would shoot up voting areas in left leaning areas under the guise of Patriotism and defending the United States from those evil liberals trying to steal the election from Trump. Absolutely terrified of something like that happening Tuesday, and the MAGA terrorist traitors probably won't even think twice about killing liberals since they assume Trump will just pardon them.

And angry people (his constituents) are very quick to accept their enemy (anyone not a republican) is cheating because of course they would, they’re evil.

I have witnessed this for 7 presidential elections. Every time vote tallies are reported (and they were ahead), they think it's over and any more vote tallies reported is cheating after the game is already over. As if when votes are reported is the final score in that state.

They watch it like a football score. When they were going on in 2020 about how they won on Election night ""and then suddenly overnight"" Biden had more votes they really thought someone looked at the ""scoreboard"" and made up points for Biden. They wanted the vote counting to ""stop"" because they absolutely believed the reports that had them ahead is the final count, and only when they are ahead.

It's not a sports score. Different counties have different makeups for votes between Democrat, Republican, or Independent. Some are more ""blue"" than others are ""red."" It is lost on them. Completely lost.

You can't really find an average Republican that doesn't think votes were made up for Gore in Florida for 2000. They are convinced dead people voted for Clinton's 2nd term.

"The concern is that if states sandbag and don't certify by dec 11th, Johnson won't extend the deadline, and he'll try to throw it to the House to decide. (He is still speaker until January no matter what)",2024_10_31
I’m sorry what? Have NOT heard about this,2024_10_31
"Entirely wrong. Sorry.

The House only matters in a contested election, in which the states vote individually. The Speaker only presides over this, it's ultimately easy math. In theory a speaker could try to whip votes to a particular party, but that would never happen with Johnson, the GOP, or really even the DNC/Jeffries.

If there's a contested election that reaches the House, Trump wins. He only needs 26 states and he has 30 at least. Maybe more/fewer if either party really sweeps the House, but it is Trump's math almost no matter what.

Don't let this be a contested election. Vote, make sure your vote is counted, volunteer, guard, and watch. And donate your money and your time.

Harris and all down ballot elections are holding mass vote bank drives this weekend. It's EASY! Train over Zoom for 30 minutes, get a list of people to call, most vote banks also give you caller ID protection (dial/text thru numbers) to make sure your real number isn't out there.",2024_10_31

Or at least tell us what they plan to do to prevent this kind of thing from happening in the future?

Or are we all just cool if 50.48% of the country votes for fascism and to end democracy altogether, the rest of us are all just going to go along with it as long as it was voted for democratically? 4 years from now when Trump(or Vance at this point) gives himself another 4 terms without an election as he constructs camps for immigrants and undesirables we're all going to think back and say ""Well at least Harris ran an honest campaign.""

> 
> In his first interview since quitting the race, Mr Biden, 81, said he had “no serious problem” with his health. He blamed his poor debate performance on being sick at the time, and brushed off concerns about his age and mental acuity.
> 
> The US president pledged to campaign for Kamala Harris saying he was going to do whatever his vice-president ""thinks I can do to help most"".
> 
> “We must, we must, we must defeat Trump,” he told US broadcaster CBS News.
> 
> Mr Biden said if he had continued his campaign, the presidential contest would have gone “down to the wire”.
> 
> ""A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races,"" he said.

More like every two years and every school board election, and also yes.

Religious fanatics and fascists don’t just give up. The GOP is no longer run by the old guard who seduced the religious right to their cause and dog whistled to racists. Nor is it even run by the religious right and the racists.

It’s run by their children and grandchildren, people for whom it was never a grift but a sincere belief. They have people screaming at them internally that spending $60 million dollars on “Kamala is for they/them” ads is pointless and stupid but they won’t stop because the objective isn’t to appeal to voters, it’s to make voters hate trans people.

It’s why they’ll never stop pushing on abortion. If someone *genuinely believes* that God demands they save every six week old fetus and that it is God’s will when a thirteen year old is raped or a quirk of fragile human physiology sentences a pregnant person to death, then leaving it as a state’s rights issue is not enough. Those terrible crimes must be stopped and the perpetrators punished. Even Trump admits that and he’s probably paid for abortions before.

"
Democrats do not understand the threat. They know Republicans are dangerous but at the same time each Democrat wants to win reelection because they are politicians. If they don't then most of them are rich enough to not have to worry about the things you do. They do not think the voters will back them up if they try and shut down Republicans. For example, Trump never got in trouble. Trump never went to jail.

We are looking at 12 straight years of a Democrat in the White House. This is important but sometimes I feel like Republicans see this as more important than Democrats do. Biden, he was old school. He thought Republicans might maybe want to help make America become a better place. Took him like a year to figure that one out. Kamala, I think, is willing to square up with Republicans because she's looking at 8 years in The White House and she's not 80 years old.

The only way we make it out of this is Kamala becomes a leader AND, big AND here, all the Not-Republicans back her up when the time comes. 

Democrats do not understand the threat. Trump should have been in jail but Democrats were all ""Well, that would look bad and what would the other countries think? What would the moderate Republicans voters think about my reelection?"" It should have never gotten this far but time, and time, and time again, Republicans back Democrats into a corner and their response is ""When they go low, we just let them.""

>WHAT PLANS ARE THERE TO ADDRESS THIS VERY OBVIOUS ISSUE EVERYONE WITH HALF A BRAIN CELL SEES IS HAPPENING?!

The Jan 6 Marines not getting the book thrown at them and basically being put back into an even *more* secure role in the military tells me that the Marines, at least, might be down for another insurrection. Even worse, I am still chewing over the stats that 20% of the people arrested on Jan 6 had military or law enforcement backgrounds.

If it were 10% I would still be worried, but 20% is a lot bigger threat, especially if there is top brass that would be willing to lead them, which sadly I think there might be one or two in the military if one were to look at the statistics from Jan 6 as a direct reflection of the entire military and their leaders.

That's what keeps me up at night, in the end. Trump and his merry band of fascists are acting like they've already won and the billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk that are jumping ship over to his side at this part in the race is definitely cause for concern. When the billionaires start to jump ship to fascism it's usually because they're seeing something others aren't seeing and it tends to be the very start of a successful fascist coup :\

"I haven’t met a police officer in my city that has had kind opinions about the left. My city had a particularly interesting time during COVID with the BLM riots. We absolutely called for them to get defunded, particularly after they started attacking medical volunteers and their supplies (we made national news when an officer decided to start stabbing and slashing a bunch of water bottles lol).


No agency is going to broadly support a political group that calls for cuts in funding, deserved or not. That’s part of why a lot of teachers lean to the left. Understandably, LEOs don’t like the party that calls for them to not be able to purchase new APCs, grenade launchers and other wild stuff. Especially agencies that are in places that don’t need cops in tanks, like mine.


Unfortunately, the agencies STILL buy shiny new toys. They instead skimp on training and salary for their workers. Those who wise up quit. Those who don’t replace them. This leads to a reduction in the requirement qualifications for new hires, which leads to underqualified and undereducated LEOs who are more likely to use their position to offend.


Then there’s the social stigma. How many times have you heard “fuck cops?” How many times in a month do you say “fuck cops?” We’ve cultivated a divide between the average American and those who are supposed to be protecting us. Is the criticism unwarranted? Absolutely not. Cops fucking suck. But one side of the political spectrum likes to lick the boot. Of course most cops are going to fall into that category.",2024_10_31

[Trump threatens Social Security’s stability](https://www.miningjournal.net/opinion/2024/10/trump-threatens-social-securitys-stability/)


Donald Trump’s tax and spending plans would add enormous amounts to the national debt, with some estimates as high as $15 trillion over a decade. But some of his tax cuts stand apart in threatening one of America’s most revered programs, Social Security. They would essentially bankrupt it by 2031.

[Imminent catastrophic public danger’: Hundreds of doctors sound new alarm about Trump](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesNews/s/3LNr3CvBZ6)


In the letter, they asserted, the 78-year old Trump “....exhibits behavior that tracks with the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual’s (DSM V) diagnostic criteria for ‘narcissistic personality disorder,’ ‘antisocial personality disorder,’ and’“paranoid personality disorder,’ all made worse by his intense sadism, which is a symptom of malignant narcissism.”

[Trump Rally Opens With Insults Aimed at Latino, Black, Jewish and Arab American Voters - The New York Times](https://archive.is/2024.10.27-230718/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/politics/trump-hinchcliffe-msg.html)

Former President Donald J. Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday opened with a standup comic who called Puerto Rico an “island of garbage” in a set that also included derogatory remarks about Latinos generally, African Americans, Palestinians and Jews.


It was a startling program for a campaign that has been trying to cut into Democrats’ support among Hispanic, Black, Jewish and Arab American voters in an effort to win in several key battleground states.
The comic, Tony Hinchcliffe, was the warm-up act ahead of several other speakers whose remarks were laced with vulgar insults, profanity and racist comments.

The crowd inside Madison Square Garden was predominantly white, with a significant number of Latinos. Many groaned at Mr. Hinchcliffe’s insult to Puerto Rico. 

Still, he told a tasteless, vulgar joke about the size of Hispanic families, mentioned watermelons as he called out a Black man in the audience and mocked Palestinians as rock-throwers and Jews as cheapskates.👀👀👀


At roughly the same time on Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris was in Philadelphia courting Pennsylvania’s sizable Puerto Rican population with a stop at a local Puerto Rican restaurant, Freddy & Tony’s.
But in New York, Mr. Trump’s rally featured a series of speakers whose remarks were far outside of longstanding political boundaries.


One, Sid Rosenberg, a conservative radio host, referred to Hillary Clinton with profanity and a sexist epithet. 

And Grant Cardone, a businessman who spoke early in the program, referred to Ms. Harris as if she were a prostitute. 

Later in the program, Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, mocked Ms. Harris’s racial identity and intelligence as he jeered the idea that she could win in November.

"Joe will go down as a lion in history.

The guy is full of integrity, he is a great politician, he is insanely accomplished, one of the few Vice Presidents who actually did something ( usually VPs are not as active due to limited power), but Biden was working ten hours every day and getting Democrats and some Republicans to support Obama ), the guy worked so hard and achieved so much, but people don`t give him the respect he deserves.

Forward to Biden’s presidency so far, he’s the most productive and effective president by accomplishments in the last 40 years at least.

Biden was able to make deals with the most obstructionist opposition in modern US history ( if not ever, apart from the era around the civil war ),

And he didn`t just make any normal deals, he created the biggest and most extensive legislation packages in all of American history.

Roosevelt the previous record holder, managed to also do an insane amount of legislation but he had the full Democratic Party behind him and absolute support in Congress and the Senate. Biden did not and still managed to pull through, and that in a single term, Roosevelt had 4.

So Biden’s accomplishment is arguably more impressive.

Edit: To all the Gaza comments:

Bibi’s been a giant pain in the ass for the Biden administration this past year, and half the reason for him coming here was to help Trump get elected.

Then there is: 

- AIPAC: It is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in America. With the Citizens United decision and increased foreign money, Israel can now have an almost direct impact on elections. Two pro-Palestinian Democratic incumbents in the U.S. House of Representatives lost in Democratic primaries because AIPAC made them the most expensive House primaries in history. This obviously sends a loud and clear message to other politicians.
	
- While Michigan has a large pro-Palestinian Muslim population, Pennsylvania—the biggest battleground state—has a sizable number of pro-Israeli Jewish Americans. Balancing between these two groups is crucial.
	
- Harris is going to base every single move from now until the election on very specific internal state-level polling and will be careful not to get ahead of it or try to shift where the electorate stands less than a month before the election.

- If Biden and Harris come out too strong against Netanyahu, they risk being labeled as anti-Semitic by the powerful right-wing media, AIPAC, and Russian disinformation campaigns. At the same time, if Biden cuts off aid to Israel, it wouldn’t be surprising if Netanyahu either stages a false flag operation or conveniently ignores intelligence of another terrorist attack just to say, “Look what Democrats did to us, making us defenseless”—a move that could guarantee a loss. After all, this is consistent with how Netanyahu thinks: the ends justify the means.

So, the best the Biden administration and Harris campaign can do is publicly toe the line while subtly signaling and “leaking” their extreme dissatisfaction with Netanyahu. Post-election, I’d bet that policy will change significantly.",2024_10_31

He will 100% turn LGBQT+ into illegal and likely overturn gay marriage and allow states to outlaw being gay. I have no doubt in my mind this is where they will go with that stuff.

He made the US the cornerstone of the multinational group supporting Ukraine and managed the resistance to Russia in a way that isolated Putin but also didn’t allow the conflict to spin out of control. He made the hard decision to remove all of our troops from Afghanistan and end our occupation once and for all.

The cycle is exhausting - Republicans trash the country, Democrats fix it all, and the next Republican takes credit for the rebound and trashes it all again.",2024_10_31
"He also played the Republicans like a fiddle in his state of the Union address when he called them out for being the only party that regularly cuts social security and disability. They boo'd him and then he turns around and drops the ""ok so we agree no more cuts to social security!"" All the booing stopped because they knew they got owned on national TV and they had to clap because a large portion of those people watch the SOTU speech.

I'm honestly surprised that the Democrats aren't playing that on TV during news segments. Show the ratio of Dems and Repubs that voted to cut their benefits and ask ""with things like food being so cheap right now, do you want more benefits or less? The choice is clear, protect yourself from Republicans by voting for Kamala Harris.""

Or you know, you could make a 4 minute commercial of all the horrible stuff Trump did in office by a speed reader and then end it with someone speaking slowly. ""Trump mishandled the pandemic and killed 1.2 million Americans. Those empty seats and your church, your sporting events, your family reunions and in your house are because people took voting lightly, let's never go back. Harris plans on keeping and funding the pandemic response team so you don't have to live in fear.""",2024_10_31

Absolutely agree. I think history will look very kindly on Biden. He leaves a great legacy.,2024_10_31
"> One failed president trying to destroy our country, one current president who gave up everything to save it.

I can hear this in the voice of that movie preview guy.

*""In a world... where one failed president is trying to destroy our country.. another must give up everything to save it.""*

<several minutes of action scenes with tense cliffhanger moments and dramatic music that includes a finale where Biden rips off his aviator glasses and replies:  ""Because I love my country, dammit!"">

He’s the best president in my lifetime and I’m 73,2024_10_31
"And for kicking that shitgibbon out in the first place. It’s easy to forget, given how persistently aggravating Trump is when he’s just doddering around his golf club, that we could have been nearing the end of his second term right now. ",2024_10_31
Big props for that.  It’s definitely time to pass the torch to a new generation.,2024_10_31

"I don't think Biden wanted a second term.  Biden should be enjoying his retirement.  He wasn't running again to serve his ego, or line his pockets.  He was sacrificing the rest of his life to protect us from Trump.  I think he is thrilled shitless to let Kamala take over, now that he knows that she has at least as good a chance of beating Trump as he did.",2024_10_31
"Same thing happened to me. The day I got the email informing me my loans had been forgiven, I sat on the floor and cried. Such a ridiculous weight finally lifted after all that time.",2024_10_31
"Up until Biden, only 7,000 people were able to get PSLF.  It was only a handful under Betsy Devos; she was actually fined for going after people who had student loans from fraudulent colleges.  

As of right now, Biden has approved relief for 5 million Americans.  That’s so great.",2024_10_31
"Same.  If you do the math, I still ended up paying almost the full amount over 20 years, I just didn't end up paying any interest or fees when I was so broke, I couldn't afford rent, much less the student loan payment amounts they were asking for.

It was actually a collector that told me about and got me on the income dependent repayment program, which worked out to $212 a month for 20 years.",2024_10_31
You know what? I support this and am happy for you. I fully paid off my student loans over 20 years ago and it was a struggle at times and LOTs of interest added. But I am here to say this forgiveness was the right thing. I wish you all the best moving forward!,2024_10_31

"You know that’s such a great point I never thought about.  Many people probably paid enough to pay off most if not all of the original loan, so really Biden was canceling the interest.  I supported the forgiveness even though I paid mine off years ago but this is a good talking point when people complain about it. Student loans shave interest free anyway. ",2024_10_31

"Assuming he probably can't run in 2028 just due to his mental decline, let's say he could. Republicans can't drop him.

"It’s so damn infuriating. We could have so much better quality of life in this country if it weren’t for Republican voters supporting corruption and grift. They elected Trump because they were sick of their own lying politicians, and Trump was supposed to break the system-which he basically did. But they can’t see that he’s not doing a damn thing for them in return. The only people he’s helped at all have been the rich and bigots.",2024_10_31
"Yup and since he plans on cutting the pandemic response team we are going to have another pandemic. He also cut the regulatory powers of the FDA so we are going to see a massive rise in food born illness, parasites and cancers related to unregulated meats.

"My little conspiracy theory is that Obama wanted to support gay marriage but couldn’t come out and say it first without getting skewered by the right, so Biden, being the goofy VP, took the bullet and “forced” Obama’s hand, when it really was their plan all along.

"Shitgibbon made me laugh out loud, bravo and cheers to Biden.  The media hid his accomplishments but those paying attention know what Biden and Harris have gotten done",2024_10_31
"Yes, exactly! When I originally took out my loans I signed up for a 2.5% interest rate. During my last semester of college I was pregnant with my son, so I was about to have a newborn and no job prospects as a new graduate. That's when the loan processor talked me into a consolidation that raised my interest rate to 5%. It felt wrong that in order to 'save' money my interest rate needed to be doubled, but I was young, didn't fully understand how it all worked, and the processor was calling me non stop and badgering me into doing the consolidation. He even threatened jail time at one point, which scared me really badly because I didn't know that you can't be jailed for debts. I finally gave up and signed the paperwork 2 days before my son was born. 

I worked minium wage 'entry level' jobs and was barely able to scrape together enough for childcare, so I deferred my loans for the first 4 years because I had literally no other choice. When my son started kindergarten I was finally able to put that money back toward the loans, but only at the minimum monthly payments for a while. The interest just kept growing out of control. I'm still furious about how scammy it was, but he was the official person contracted to process federal loans, so I gave in. Turned out that my gut instincts were correct and it was a really shady thing that they were getting away with during W's administration.

Biden's forgiveness not only wiped out all of that excessive interest, but I also got a refund of the little bit that I had overpaid. I wouldn't have been upset if I had to pay back the 2.5% interest as well, since I knew that going into the borrowing process, but honestly, student loans shouldn't have any interest at all because it should be viewed as an investment in the future tax paying workforce. And I'm going to be absolutely celebrating in the streets the day they make higher education free, even though I had to pay, because making things better and easier for the next generation *should* be the goal, right?",2024_10_31

"Unfortunately, these are all too difficult for trump supporters to follow. 

As an immigrant here in the US for a decade (not eligible to vote), the way i see US politics is that it's not public service job. Politicians on both side of the aisle want to hold on to their job and do what it takes to stay in position.

Republicans know the vote bank is with supporting Trump so though they know the problem with indecency,  violence etc they will support Trump to keep his voter base supporting their own bids. Without any policy, their only job has been to criticize every Democrat led bills.
How MTG and Boebart get elected is beyond me and will need AI to decode it for me in future

But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”",2024_10_31

Right now, they're throwing tantrums across the internet about Biden's comments because all they care about are half-truths and gotcha moments. Every single bit of it is dishonest and hypocritical.

They have decided to make actual patriots and defenders of democracy their mortal enemies, while supporting a presidential nominee who has more admiration for foreign dictators than our constitution.

Trumpers are the epitome of unserious people, but they're also very dangerous. They always will be. This will not end with the election, either way. They will never be governable by anyone but Trump, and eventually Trump will turn on them too. When this happens, we all know they'll STILL be blaming democrats and Hillary Clinton.

There is no silver lining or inevitable moment of clarity with these people. No scene from a movie where the crowd drops their Tump flags on the ground and walk away because they've finally had enough. No epiphanies. No acquiescence. No misunderstandings. Trumpers only one want thing, and that's to win, win, win, and beat the democrats. They would rather die as the result of Trump's buffoonery than admit they were wrong, and many of them have.

So, let's stop pretending they can be brought back to reality. They're in too deep and always were. They've had a decade to course correct, and they have only doubled down during this time. At some point, you just gotta face facts and call them what they are. Garbage.

The only people still clinging to this notion that Trumpers can be saved are the same people in zombie movies who get eaten by their spouses because they think there's still a person somewhere inside. There's not. It's time to start seeing them the same way they see the rest of us. Otherwise, we're zombie food.",2024_10_31

The fact that Biden has held his tongue this long is a miracle. I have absolutely no sympathy for these people. They’re destroying our country quite literally. What Biden was saying is true, if after everything you’ve seen and heard over the past 9 years hasn’t persuaded you away from MAGA you literally are garbage that only cares about one person, yourself.

Mike Pence may have catered to Trump while it was politically convenient, but when it came to choosing between Trump and the Constitution, Pence made the right call. Vance, however, has shown from day one that he wouldn’t have the backbone to do the same. He's posturing as Trump’s loyal yes-man, clearly eyeing the chance to style himself as Trump’s successor in 2028.

Ohhhh.... In 2019, the Pennsylvania Legislature, then controlled by Republicans, passed a law creating a system for early voting different from most states. It allows registered voters to go to their county elections office, request a mail ballot, and fill out an application. Once that is reviewed, the ballot is printed. They can then fill it out and turn it in during that visit or return it by mail or place it in a drop box.

Lines have been long because that process can take about 10 to 12 minutes per voter, Bucks County Board of Elections Chairman Bob Harvie told CBS News.

""It is a very cumbersome process. We don't have limitless resources here. We have a fixed number of staff. We have a fixed budget,"" Harvie said.

> Several citizens were permitted to run &quot;Test&quot; ballots through machines assigned to their county, including Savage, who was spotted on camera folding the ballots into his pocket while confirming with an election official that they were &quot;Absolutely, totally real ballots.&quot; Although they weren&#039;t official ballots, the ballots did not say &quot;Fake&quot; or &quot;Sample&quot; and were being tracked and counted by the state.

> After pocketing the ballots, Savage leaned over to a woman streaming the event on Facebook Live, telling her that there was a &quot;Fucked-up count.&quot; Upon exiting, Savage approached a man outside the government facility and showed him the ballots in his pocket before the unidentified man patted him on his back.

> Last week, Trump issued his first call to arms for the 2024 race, preemptively claiming on Truth Social that the November election is already rigged, mere days into early voting.

"WE NEVER HAD THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE TRUMP.

Just remember that.

>The campaign did not point to any instance in particular that led it to believe that voters had been treated unfairly in Bucks County, but county officials had observed that there were complaints on social media (shared by the Trump campaign) about long lines to obtain mail-in ballots on Tuesday, the last day of their availability. Due to a miscommunication, some voters believed they could not have their mail-in ballot requests accommodated, Bucks County officials wrote on X, noting that that information was incorrect and that all voters who had joined the line before 5 p.m. would be able to receive a mail-in ballot.

>But Trump chose to stoke the flames Wednesday morning, posting on Truth Social that “Pennsylvania is cheating, and getting caught, at large scale levels rarely seen before.”

Didn't Donald Trump say for years that none of his voters should use mail-in ballots? Yet, here we are. In any case, there was a miscommunication and people got the wrong idea, but Bucks County accommodated everyone who got on line before 5pm.

"Pennsylvania is one of seven states that does not allow election workers to begin processing absentee or mail ballots until 7 a.m. Election Day. This means workers across the commonwealth must deal with these ballots at the same time the polls are open, functionally running two elections at once, which can cause delays in unofficial results being available.

Much has changed since 2020. County election directors have more experience with the state’s mail voting law, passed in 2019. Counties have also received millions of dollars to supplement their election budgets from a state-funded grant program. Those dollars have been used, in some cases, to purchase machines to more quickly open and sort mail ballots.

This was a cause of much complaining by Trump in 2020, but Pennsylvania Republicans would not allow pre canvasing this year either. They want something to fight about.",2024_10_31

I grew up around Germans, my sister was born in Germany, and my father remarried and eventually passed away there. My first born son was born there. They hate fascists and Hitler. Most are embarrassed by his hateful crimes and what he did to the world. To display a Swastika is illegal. Many Germans died because of Hitler. Believe me when I say most would go to war against the NAZIS. They know it is a stain on their history, and almost every German I know or can think of hates with a passion... Donald Trump. They recognize and smell the same bs Hitler spoke of, vermin, the enemy within, the others. They tried multiple times to remove Hitler from power. In the end, it was his own hand that sealed his fate. Just like it will be Donald Trumps actions this coming Nov 5 that will decide his. He knows defeat is at hand. The enemy from within is going to vote him out. He can sense defeat and is becoming increasingly desperate. This is just the start. Be strong America. As a veteran, I ask you to stand brave in the face of tyranny and fulfill your destiny. Take your rightful place as that shining beacon on the hill once mentioned by a former republican president.

I keep seeing this take.  It's nonsense.  Trump was always going to claim massive voter fraud regardless of the outcome.  He claimed massive voter fraud in 2016 when he did win.

If he loses, ""it was stolen.""  If he wins, ""I would have won the popular vote.""  If he wins that, ""I would have won by more.""

If he won 150 million votes to one, he would still claim that one vote was fraud.

These lawsuits against states, even when 'frivolous' or completely under false pretenses is that they are fought by the state. This means these lawsuits actively siphon public TAX-PAYER funds away from the services they could otherwise be put towards.

Not only is Trump filing bullshit lawsuits, he is actively wasting tax dollars with every single one solely to inflate his ego and peddle this idea that the election is 'being stolen'. So especially in states where tax dollars may not amount to a whole lot, he is taking money that could be spent on constituents from them and preventing them from having better services provided by the state. 

If they're expensive enough, he can even turn around and talk about how the states aren't using taxes on the public and constantly wasting money and his base will eat it up, despite the fact that he is part of the reason the state has even less to spend on things such as infrastructure and social goods",2024_10_31

"They are using the Virginia DMV database, anyone when they initially registered with the DMV and picked the ""immigrant"" option was flagged and potentially removed, even if they had become a citizen since then.

But unlike the person you replied to, I don't think it's very widespread. I live in VA and no one I know or am remotely connected with had anything wrong with their registration (to my knowledge). 

Allegedly it's about 1,600 people that were flagged and removed using the above criteria. Some people are upset that it's mainly affecting people in some of the most left-leaning counties in the state, but those counties are also some of the most populous so it's not that strange of a coincidence imo.

Even if someone was mistakenly removed when they should not have been, Virginia has same-day voter registration, so you could in theory register to vote on Election Day itself and be fine. 

I will, however, mention that any systematic removal of people from voter rolls within 90 days of an election is illegal under the national voter registration act of 1993, but SCOTUS ruled today to uphold the purge anyway which is unfortunate.",2024_10_31

In any other country in the world, 15 minutes after that tape went public, Trump would go into hiding and never be heard from again. In America, he became president and his party won a majority in both branches of government too. Looney Tunes shit.

"This is great that these young people are hearing this and paying attention. One of the biggest issues with Trump's popularity, in my opinion, is the ""news"" that the right tends to watch trump-washes all of the news, so they NEVER hear any of the negative things about him only how great he is. Mainstream media has also been way, way too nice to him for the past 9 years. If all the mainstream news had been calling him out daily for his crimes, his insane ranting at rallies, his total disdain for women, people of any color other than white, and the poor we might not be in this situation now where he could potentially be elected yet again. The PRESS is the main issue in this country, right after the maga people who refuse to even attempt to learn how this man actually is. I'm a boomer who has been a registered republican his entire life, although I have always voted for the person I thought would do the best job, that included Obama, Hillary and Biden.

She asked the teens how they felt about the Chris Brown and Rihanna situation and none of them even knew about it. It blew my mind that they know who both of them are but had no idea Chris beat the shit out of her.

>The Committee's final report of August 2020 found that Stone did have access to Wikileaks and that Trump had spoken to Stone and other associates about it multiple times. Immediately after the Access Hollywood tape was released in October 2016, Stone directed his associate Jerome Corsi to tell Julian Assange to ""drop the Podesta emails immediately,"" which Wikileaks leaked minutes later. The Committee also found that Wikileaks ""very likely knew it was assisting a Russian intelligence influence effort."" In written responses to the Mueller investigation, Trump had stated he did not recall such discussions with Stone.[135][136][137]

Because I had a complete stranger sneak up behind me and grope me in the middle of the day at a gas station while [my husband] was in the bathroom. It was terrifying, and I’m still scared when I’m alone at gas stations all these years later.” The dumbfounded look on his face… apparently, he had never thought that HIS daughter could be an assault victim.

I am happy to say that I am hopeful he’s not voting for Trump this time around. I don’t know for sure, obviously, but he made an unprompted comment during primaries that all he needed to know about the candidates was which ones were Trump supporters so he wouldn’t vote for them.

"Seriously. It's bad enough even if he were just a loser who stayed at home and had a trivial role in society. We should expect a lot more out of the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. This should be a person we look up to and respect, who conducts themselves with class and dignity. 

Also... Was it ""locker room talk"" to flirt with 14-year-olds?:



> After watching a youth choir sing carols, Trump asked two of the girls how old they were. When they said they were 14, Trump, who again was 46 at the time, said, “Wow! Just think — in a couple of years, I'll be dating you.”

...


Or when he said the same fucking thing about an even younger girl

> In the 1992 recording, a 46-year-old Trump asks a little girl if she’s going to go up an escalator. Then Trump turns to the camera and says, “I am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?

....

More ""goodies"":

> I’ve known Jeff [Epstein] for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.

...

> Mr. Trump frequently sought assurances — at times from strangers — that the women in his life were beautiful. During the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant, he sat in the audience as his teenage daughter, Ivanka, helped to host the event from onstage. He turned to Brook Antoinette Mahealani Lee, Miss Universe at the time, and asked for her opinion of his daughter’s body.

> “‘Don’t you think my daughter’s hot? She’s hot, right?’” Ms. Lee recalled him saying. ‘I was like, ‘Really?’ That’s just weird. She was 16. That’s creepy.”

...

Speaking about his 1-year-old daughter Tiffany's breasts:

> When Trump was asked whether Tiffany looked more like him or Trump’s then-wife Marla Maples, he said Marla, and added that Tiffany was “a really beautiful baby.” But the first specific feature Trump mentioned wasn’t anything in her face — it was her legs.

> “She’s got Marla’s legs. We don’t know whether or not she’s got this part yet,” Trump said, miming a pair of breasts over his own chest, “but time will tell.”

...

Or when he had to clarify he wasn't ""interested"" in Paris Hilton... *when she was 12*:

> Now, somebody who a lot of people don’t give credit to but is in actuality very beautiful is Paris Hilton. I’ve known Paris Hilton from the time she’s 12, her parents are friends of mine, and the first time I saw her she walked into the room and I said, ‘Who the hell is that?’ At 12, I wasn’t interested … but she was beautiful.

Reminder that Donald Trump was found to be a sexual abuser by a jury of his peers in May 2023.

...

> Mr. Trump frequently sought assurances — at times from strangers — that the women in his life were beautiful. During the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant, he sat in the audience as his teenage daughter, Ivanka, helped to host the event from onstage. He turned to Brook Antoinette Mahealani Lee, Miss Universe at the time, and asked for her opinion of his daughter’s body.

> “‘Don’t you think my daughter’s hot? She’s hot, right?’” Ms. Lee recalled him saying. ‘I was like, ‘Really?’ That’s just weird. She was 16. That’s creepy.”

...

Speaking about his 1-year-old daughter Tiffany's breasts:

> When Trump was asked whether Tiffany looked more like him or Trump’s then-wife Marla Maples, he said Marla, and added that Tiffany was “a really beautiful baby.” But the first specific feature Trump mentioned wasn’t anything in her face — it was her legs.

> “She’s got Marla’s legs. We don’t know whether or not she’s got this part yet,” Trump said, miming a pair of breasts over his own chest, “but time will tell.”

...

Or when he had to clarify he wasn't ""interested"" in Paris Hilton... *when she was 12*:

> Now, somebody who a lot of people don’t give credit to but is in actuality very beautiful is Paris Hilton. I’ve known Paris Hilton from the time she’s 12, her parents are friends of mine, and the first time I saw her she walked into the room and I said, ‘Who the hell is that?’ At 12, I wasn’t interested … but she was beautiful.

...

Or when he was 46 years old and literally flirted with 14-year-olds:

> After watching a youth choir sing carols, Trump asked two of the girls how old they were. When they said they were 14, Trump, who again was 46 at the time, said, “Wow! Just think — in a couple of years, I'll be dating you.”

...

Or when he said the same fucking thing about an even younger girl

> In the 1992 recording, a 46-year-old Trump asks a little girl if she’s going to go up an escalator. Then Trump turns to the camera and says, “I am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?

"They do care. But not in the way you think. 

People who are racist, or misogynist, or whatever else attracts them to support someone like Trump - they have the maturity and emotional intelligence of children. You ever see that phase in young children, where if they're caught doing something bad, they'll lie about it, even if it's incredibly obvious? They do it because they want to avoid getting into trouble and facing consequences, sure, but a big part of it is because they're learning about core concepts in society, and how they function on a basic binary. There's good, and there's bad. Good people do good things, bad people do bad things. Everyone, fundamentally, believes that they're the good guy. So when a child, who believes they're a good person, is caught doing something objectively *bad*, they can't rationalize it. If they're doing something *bad*...oh no, that would make them a bad person...but they're not a bad person! Nope! I didn't do it! I couldn't have done it! I'm a good person! 

People who support Trump and then hear something so fundamentally evil and socially maladaptive simply can't reconcile with that reality. Whether it's the hollywood access tapes, or any of the millions of insane lies and ramblings he's spewed over his entire lifetime, if they admit that what they heard from Trump was unacceptable, then they have to grapple with their black-and-white perspective of good and evil. A normal person who is capable of thinking critically and humbling themselves will recognize that they were deceived, and lied to, and sure, that feels awful, but they CAN do better. They can deal with the pain and accept their failure, and grow from it into someone else. People who still support Trump physically CAN'T do it, because they approach it like a child. ""Trump did this bad thing. But...if he did this bad thing, that means he's a bad person...And, if I'm supporting a bad person, that makes ME a bad person...but I'm not bad! I'm good! I'm a good person, so he HAS to be a good person! I don't care if he did this, and I don't care what else he does! He talks like me and supports people like me, so he HAS to be on my side!"" 

Poor, poor bastards don't even realize that the Nazis also thought they were the heroes. The villains in the saturday morning cartoons think they're in the right, and Satan rebelled against God because he believed he was entitled to be the greatest creation of God, not humanity. It *always* starts with believing you're a good person, rather than recognizing that people are *always* shades of grey, with zero moral purity to be found anywhere in the world. 

If you go looking for moral purity, you will either fool yourself into making it the fuck up, or fall into despair. MAGAts do the former. Anarchists who want to tear the whole system down are the latter.",2024_10_31

"And how low can Peter Thiel go? He is an libertarian and *an authoritarian*:

> ""Most importantly, I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible."" - Peter Thiel, 2009

He is a rich ultra-right wing libertarian that most likely would orgasm
if ending up with a society as described in the [Libertarian Police
Department](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/l-p-d-libertarian-police-department)
story.

He has also in true libertarian spirit attempted to fund development of
some free floating offshore project called Seasteading that should be some libertarian utopia
without any kind of governance with building or safety regulations or any such pesky ""freedom
stealing"" things that a normal society needs to function.

The podcast [Behind the bastards](https://www.behindthebastards.com/) had two episodes about it:

* [Part One: The Not-At-All-Sad History of Libertarian Sea Nations](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/episode/part-one-the-not-at-all-sad-history-of-89890804/)

This project is possibly the least harmful thing Peter has done, since it has
has drained him for a lot of money that he cannot use for other evil things,
and the people scammed are other libertarian fools.

But do not think that libertarians are not able to harm! I guess the closest thing
to a successful attempt to creating a libertarian utopia is when a bunch of libertarians
decided to move and try to take over some smaller town Grafton in New Hampshire
as a [""Free Town Project""](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21534416/free-state-project-new-hampshire-libertarians-matthew-hongoltz-hetling)
(later changed to ""Free State Project""), and ruined it with their reckless governance.

Like for instance getting rid of public garbage collection.
And with no mandatory garbage collection, of course they got problems
with wild bears walking around peoples' houses (in addition to some idiots deliberately
feeding wild bears, but hey in a libertarian society nobody should be
able to force people to stop doing what they want...).

There is a book about it with title [""A Libertarian Walks Into a Bear""](https://www.allbookstores.com/search?type=advance&author=&title=A+Libertarian+Walks+Into+a+Bear&isbn=&binding=&dateyear_operator=during&dateyear=).

> Proud woman-hating is also a feature at Trump rallies, as we saw just a few days ago, when former Fox News host Tucker Carlson gave a speech where he rolled out an incestuous BDSM fantasy about ""Daddy"" giving ""a vigorous spanking"" to the ""bad girl,"" imagined as a teenage daughter. 
> 
> Even when promising to ""protect"" women, Trump can't help but sound creepy or threatening. Wednesday night, he told a Wisconsin crowd he wants to ""protect the women of our country,"" and, ""I'm gonna do it whether the women like it or not."" Feminists have long argued that ""chivalry"" is just another form of male domination, disguised as benevolence. Trump, as he often does, proves the feminist case.",2024_10_31

They're trash raised by trash, generation after generation of braindead human garbage, and their sexism and homophobia define every aspect of their lives. The irony is they think about other men's private parts more than gay men do. And the reason they do this is because their fathers beat into them - in a very literal sense - the idea that the worst thing a man can be is *gay,* because the worst thing a man can be is *like a woman.* This implies that the worst thing anyone can be is *a woman.* This is conservatism's entire worldview.

All the messages and rallies since have been staged to serve 2 purposes. To actually lessen the vote count, hence all the super-weirdness in the past few weeks.... as well as to alienate certain groups i.e. The MSG episode, since they are not really embraced by maga, as a group. Such antics actually improve Trump's street cred. amongst maga.

">“He’ll cut costs without anybody even knowing it—nobody’s going to notice—nobody is going to feel it,” Trump told Hannity, confirming that Musk does indeed plan to slash $2 trillion from the government’s budget.

>Musk has proposed heading a “[Department of Government Efficiency](https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/10/18/dogecoin-soars-15-as-elon-musk-replies-d-o-g-e-to-question-about-proposed-department-of-government-efficiency/)” under a Trump Cabinet—and the former president has clearly taken him up on it. At Trump’s hate-filled Madison Square Garden rally over the weekend, Musk announced that the target is $2 trillion in cuts.

>Trimming the budget to the level would have to include cuts to essential government services like Medicare and Social Security—and could result in an initial huge economic crash. But Musk admitted Tuesday that that’s all a part of the plan, agreeing with a far-right troll on X that crashing the economy would lead to “sounder footing” in two years.

The federal government is on track to spend $6.5 trillion this year. Would you notice if suddenly your family lost a third of its budget?

Here. https://newrepublic.com/article/183971/jd-vance-weird-terrifying-techno-authoritarian-ideas

“Yarvin is the chief thinker behind an obscure but increasingly influential far-right neoreaction, or NRx, movement, that some call the “Dark Enlightenment.” Among other things, it openly promotes dictatorships as superior to democracies and views nations like the United States as *outdated software systems. Yarvin seeks to reengineer governments by breaking them up into smaller entities called “patchworks,” which would be controlled by tech corporations.*

“The basic idea of Patchwork is that, as the crappy governments we inherited from history are smashed, they should be replaced by a global spiderweb of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of sovereign and independent mini-countries, each governed by its own joint-stock corporation without regard to the residents’ opinions,” he wrote in Patchwork: A Political System for the 21st Century.

Each patchwork would be ruled by a “realm”: a corporation with absolute power. Citizens would be free to move, but every other realm would also be ruled by corporate governments with chilling impunity. For example, Yarvin says the tech overlords of the San Francisco realm could arbitrarily decide to cut off its citizens’ hands with no fear of legal consequences—because they’re a sovereign power, beholden to no federal government or laws.”

Now let’s go deeper.   Oligarchs.   Elon has been in talking with V. Putin. Why?  I think advice how to line things up like he did post Soviet collapse.  Let’s remember that Vlad is an absolute enemy of US and was emasculated by the Fall.  Totally in his motives to do to  US what the West did to him. 

So the Tech Bros want a new government. Something more us-them / everyone is an employee.  Thiel has stated many times he wants a Golden Rule place where only those with gold rule. Seasteading. He talked about a floating county where he could do anything he wanted. Literally. (At one time he was linked with under age male escorts on a boat in the ocean. He claimed “international waters”’or such.) 
And JD is a puppet of Theil.  Maybe a “oh no. Trump fall off balcony. Guess I’m in charge now,” intrigue.

"Elon Musk is talking about an economic downturn due to a massive government spending cut. The idea is that to balance the budget and to top an increase in debt, the government must slash spending. And he's right when he says that this will lead to a an economic downturn that will eventually turn into a recovery.

The thing is, though, that spending cuts aren't the only way to balance the budget. Another way is to raise taxes. If taxes were raised on the rich, and not raised on the poor, then the economic effect would still be same - an economic downturn followed by a recovery. However, if you take away money from the rich, you'll end up tanking the stock market. This is because the rich are more likely to save and invest any excess money they get, while the poor are more likely to spend any excess money they get.

In short, raising taxes does *less* damage to society and to the economy than cutting government spending.

Also note that there is a clear correlation between the introduction of tax cuts for the rich and an increase in government debt levels. This can been seen from the early 1980s onwards.",2024_10_31

Even infamous neoliberal bastions like the IMF have taken a pretty firm stance that austerity is *bad* for debt sustainability at this point. As you say, it causes the deficit to increase, but it also shrinks the economy so the pre-existing debt is now a greater % of GDP than it already was.

Austerity is ideological - if it was ever implemented with genuine goals of debt reduction, it's not the case now.

Additionally When and where tax cuts are used to invest, they almost never are used to fund projects and such.

I would just like to add for anybody who thinks ""ok a recession would be bad, but at least our debt would drop"" - the assertion that cutting government spending leads to reduced government debt is at best debatable.

IMF research in recent years has shown that government austerity generally leads to minimal reduction in debt or even an increase in debt, because while spending goes down, government revenue also tanks due to the damage done to the economy.

Which reminds me. When they want to be honored by a charity, they need to donate say $5M. They don't even pay. They get their vendors and even employees to contribute in their name. I saw one vendor give $100k and was asked to up it to $250k, effectively wiping out a month of profits. And everyone else at the event and in the paper saw the billionaire as donating the millions personally.",2024_10_31
"Republicans are very, very bad at understanding big picture (libertarians even more, but that’s a whole other topic). 

Case in point: in New Hampshire you are not required to have car insurance. It’s everyone’s right to not get it. If you get hit by someone else, you better hope they have it or that they have enough money to pay the required amount, or else it’s on you to figure things out. 

Old staunch Republican I work with just got rear ended a couple weeks ago. He was saying how she was a young girl who didn’t have insurance and smashed in the back half of his truck. His insurance had to cover everything, AND it went up for being in a collision. He said “I just don’t know how it’s ok for these people to be driving around without insurance. It makes the rest of us pay for it if they screw up.” It was hard for me to ignore the fact he had been all big on “live free or die” and our right to not have strict regulations and requirements like Massachusetts, but now that it’s affected him he can suddenly see why those systems or requirements are a good thing.

"Let's hope there are enough people out there with their mindset. 

I feel like so many people are oblivious to how serious this particular election actually is.

Seriously, If Trump were to win, there is a distinct possibility that the western world could become considerably weaker and more unstable. If he were to cause an economic crash (given that almost everything is tied to the US), it could have significant repercussions outside the US too. Additionally, his stance on NATO and Russia could potentially embolden Putin to act.

It is also worth considering the potential consequences of eliminating key government departments, such as the Department of Education, as has been suggested. Such a move could have devastating long-term effects on American society.

And that's just a few things. This election is of great consequence for US democracy and the US as we know it, as well as for all the other Western countries.

"Depends a lot on sunlight but my buddy who is way further into growing peppers lives in Pennsylvania and has a straight up patch of pepper plants that are like 2-3 feet tall. 

This fall, i bought a grow tent and have a jalapeño and a devil’s tongue in there and I’m gonna see how they do over the winter. So far, the indoor jalapeño is dormant while the devil’s tongue is growing and sprouting new leaves daily. Kinda weird. 

Then I have a jalapeño in my office window and the damn thing is still giving me peppers. Got a lot of hot peppers homies at work so, it’s fun. ",2024_10_31

The hope is if more Trumpers (who are about +10 to +12% more male) have voted early there had to be a corresponding spike in females to hold the ratio to its 2020 level. Harris has about +12 to +14 for women so the more voters vote with equal m to f the more votes she gains. If more females are voting it's a bigger gain.

Original Comment:

Yeah, I'm not sure either about Trump's total for Men this year vs. 2020 vs. 2016. But the gender gap between him and Harris is wider than it was between Trump and Biden in 2020. Crazy times this year. Election night will be interesting!",2024_10_31
"I still think this is a good sign overall.

2016 had roughly 1/3 of turnout early, vs this year where it is already about 2/3 of projected turnout. It will be more difficult for Republicans to close the gender gap with one third of votes outstanding vs 2016 when they had two thirds outstanding.",2024_10_31
"I agree that the early voting data is not something we should read too much into. It is quite possibly, probably even likely, that it’s a factor of who is voting when, not how the demographic break down will turn out in the end.

That said, based on polling we know that there has been a significant shift in the polling results for white women since 2016. They’re obviously no where near what black women do, but even a few points can make a big difference.  Point being - I feel like there is a good likelihood that the female vote is running up higher numbers for Kamala than it did for Hillary.",2024_10_31

"Honestly the polls are too inaccurate for me to give a good example. The trend seems to be that Harris has widened the gap from 2020 by a couple of percentage points. (54-55 Harris v. 42-43 Trump this year, against 54 v. 43 in 2020.) 

But these polls all have multiple points of error for each candidate here, so I really do not think we can know. It seems reasonable to assume that there is at least a *slight* trend, but it might not exist, or it might be much larger than the polls show. 

At this point everything is noise. There are too many factors involved in this election to be able to reasonably compare to past ones.",2024_10_31
"Hi, by ""gender gap"" I meant (wrongly) that Harris is winning a higher percentage of women voters than Biden did in 2020. And Trump (2024) is winning a higher percentage of men voters than Biden did in 2020. 

However, it appears that is incorrect. It looks like [the gap](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-harris-gender-gap-election.html) is about [the same](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-harris-poll-gender-gap/) as [Trump/Biden](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/).

All this went well beyond typical political division, it encouraged hostility, fear, and emboldened groups with deeply divisive and hateful agendas.  

There is no comparison between these actions and the general opposition from Democrats.

While the Democratic party has directly attacked Trump for quite a while, Trump has actively encouraged division by attacking US citizens calling anyone he disagrees with the ""Enemy within"" which is deeply troubling. On top of that, policy wise, Kamala has ventured further right than even Biden trying to win more centrist votes or votes of those who disagree with Trump's rhetoric but can't fully get behind a progressive agenda. The easiest example to pull for this is the border. If anyone is trying to reach a broader base of people to represent them, it's Kamala.

Can you define worse, and what policies lead to the worse result? From what I'm looking at, the main border control policy trump implemented was title 42 which Biden kept active for years. Also keep in mind trump used his political influence to block a border bill in order to use this as a running point rather than allowing Congress to work towards a solution. 

>crime has been worse under Biden,

Incorrect according to the FBI, do you have a source for your statistics? 

>Biden just called trump supporters garbage,

1. Biden isn't Kamala

2. This was in direct response to calling Puerto Rico a garbage island. Appropriate to say? Probably not. Defendable? Arguably yes. 


>the dems made all sorts of false claims about Russian interference which went absolutely nowhere.

There was an investigation, In case you didn't hear, trump was found to have colluded with Russia and interfered with the 2016 election. It was a whole [report](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/) even. 

>Kamala criticized all of trumps policies and is now copying them, border wall, tax cut on tips, fracking and many other things.

As mentioned in my prior comment, I actually agree. Kamala has moved significantly right in her policies.

"Biden is not only fully cognizant (as his full medical exam showed this spring) but also managed to outsmart Trump which is how he turned an election he was probably going to lose into a tossup race by choosing to drop out and endorse the one person who has the chops to kick Trump's ass. And for the sake of argument, even if hypothetically Pelosi had the power to force Biden to leave the race (she doesn't), why would she be the bad guy here for getting someone with dementia to drop? It sounds like you are trying to argue things both ways, that Harris is bad for not getting Biden to resign (even though she couldn't do so by herself even if she wanted to) but Pelosi is bad for forcing Biden to drop out of the race (even though he quit the race voluntarily).",2024_10_31
"Yes, this. Both sides are NOT equal. Anything Kamala Harris has said is NOT equal to what Donald Trump has been saying. It's not even close and I believe this to be the objective truth. Also their track record in terms of their whole career and the jobs they had, it's also not equal. This is pure delusion or misinformation or propaganda.",2024_10_31

"Illegal border crossings peaked in 2023 and were very high in 2022 overall have been much higher under the Biden administration if I could post links here I’d link it but you can Google it. The Biden administration repealed a bunch of executive orders and border policies on their very first day again Google is your friend, Anderson Cooper also confronted Kamala Harris about this on their CNN interview she never denied it.

It’s true Kamala isn’t Biden but it also wasn’t trump who made those comments on Puerto Rico but someone at his rally again showing the double standards.

The conclusion of the 2016 collusion investigation found no grounds to charge trump and innaufficient evidence a quick Wikipedia will tell you that so will the final report by Durham. 

We agree on Kamala moving her policies.

If she somehow doesn't win the presidency, I'm going to be absolutely devastated. Not even because Trump is going to set out to systematically destroy America as we know it, but because we would be robbed of the opportunity to see her put America back on the right track and restore our place in the world order as a champion of liberty and freedom. 

America has long been the tip of the spear when it comes to fighting tyranny and dictatorships around the world. Our allies, and the world in general, need us to step back into that role with Harris at the helm. The vultures of Russian and China and the billionaire oligarch class have smelled blood in the water in America ever since Trump won the Republican primary almost a decade ago because they all knew that Trump could be bought and/or manipulated.

Harris cannot be. She has spent her entire life as a public servant and bleeds red white and blue. Trump and his kind are clearly terrified of her, and for good reason.....",2024_10_31

> Vice President Kamala Harris gave a speech on Tuesday night that largely exorcised the dark forces that have hung over the National Mall ever since January 6, 2021.

> In a video, the president referred to Sunday&#039;s rhetoric as &quot;Garbage,&quot; and the GOP and its flying monkeys insisted that the president had referred to the former president*&#039;s supporters as &quot;Garbage.&quot; Oooh! A &quot;Deplorables&quot; moment! The popinjay political press-Axios and, inevitably, Tiger Beat on the Potomac-gleefully glommed onto the meretricious barbering of what the president said.

> Sitting about 1,000 feet behind her in the White House, President JOE BIDEN was busy undoing all of that, handing Republicans fuel to undermine that argument precisely one week before the first votes get counted.

"A deeply reactionary speech, but par for the course for Democrats, I think.

> Nearly 250 years ago, America was born when we wrested freedom from a petty tyrant.

Identifying as ""we"" even though the vast majority of her crowd would have been disenfranchised when the country was founded. Unless you're a rich landlowning white guy, there is no ""we"" when it comes to the founding.

She continues this conflation of the ruling class and everyone else below: 

> Across the generations, Americans have preserved that freedom, expanded it, and in so doing proved to the world that **a government of, by, and for the people is strong and can endure**. And those who came before us...**on farmlands, and factory floors, they did not struggle, sacrifice and lay down their lives only to see us seed our fundamental freedoms. They didn’t do that only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant.**

Labor organizers and civil rights activists were spied on, shot, deported, and locked up by the U.S. government. And continue to be. That government has a lot of work to do before talking about ""us"". She wants to claim Stonewall while giving a state's rights argument about trans people? *Oof*

> We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths—that all of us are created equal —is the star that guides us still...to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that **our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.**

This universalism, from the same party that refused to let a single Palestinian on the main stage at the DNC while letting multiple fascists speak.

But we need someone in office with confidence when speaking to nations abroad. Trump isn’t lying when he said Iran was broke when he was in office, they were set back years from not being able to trade oil. Now Iranian funded military groups were able to massacre Israelis on behalf of Palestine. Trump wants to drill more on American soil and lift restrictions.

But Donald Trump picked up female support in 2020 with white women.


From 52% to 55%.

https://19thnews.org/2020/11/white-women-had-doubts-they-voted-for-trump-anyway/

>Among White women, according to NBC News, 43 percent supported Biden and 55 percent supported Trump. About 91 percent of Black women supported the former vice president and 8 percent supported Trump. Roughly 70 percent of Latina women supported Biden and 28 percent supported the outgoing president. 


>There was little meaningful change from 2016, when the same exit poll showed that 43 percent of White women supported Clinton and 52 percent supported Trump; 94 percent of Black women supported Clinton and 4 percent supported Trump; and 69 percent of Latinas supported Clinton and 25 percent supported Trump.

> While it is not known how women who have cast ballots early have voted, the data is worrying supporters of Trump who fear it may indicate he will not be able to win in November.

> It is not known if the increased turnout among women is only beneficial for Harris since Trump has seen success in his recent calls for Republicans to cast their ballots ahead of Election Day, after previously attacking all forms of early voting.

Think about it. Everything has been going downhill since then, and the Republican Party has gotten more and more extreme since then. 

Assuming history books continue to exist, they’ll put 2010 as one of the most consequential elections in the nation’s history. If Democrats win in 2010, they keep their state level advantage and the House. With more favorable maps, the Democrats hold onto the Senate instead of losing it in 2014. With control of the Senate, Obama is able to replace Scalia with a liberal justice, giving the liberals the majority on the Supreme Court. Not to mention by holding onto majorities in both chambers of Congress, Obama’s agenda wouldn’t have been cut short halfway through his first term, and he might have been able to pass even more reforms in healthcare, finance, and education. With more reforms and legislative successes to run on, Democrat turnout in the 2016 election would have been much higher, and a Democrat would have succeeded Obama instead of Trump. With that, we get even more liberal justices on the SCOTUS and all through the federal courts. The pandemic response team wouldn’t have been disbanded, so even COVID may have played out _much_ differently. And of course, Roe v Wade remains intact.

Instead, the left sat out the 2010 election, and the opposite of everything I just said unfurled. And it will take literal decades of record voter turnout from the left to even start undoing the damage.",2024_10_31

And here's hoping that some time in the future, the GOP rejects its flirtation with American Fascism, so you'll have a sane choice going forward.

Being Conservative isn't evil in my book. It may be wrong in my mind and I'll always work to keep Conservatives out of power, but no bird can fly with just one wing, as an old saying goes. On the other hand, Fascism is downright evil, and must be opposed. Period.",2024_10_31

"Can we all agree to just not stop paying attention following the election? 

The key to advancing policy is to shift from Campaign Mode to Advocacy Mode the second we win. This is when change can happen. This is when pressuring Republicans is a must. 

This is when you *persuade* and *move* the electorate that progressive policies are the BEST thing to do. Not when in campaign mode when you must meet them where they're at to win.

And so in this respect, I propose to emphasize 2 things:

**1) Campaign Finance / Election Reform** 

- Abolish Electoral College
- Abolish FPTP for something such as Approval or STAR voting 
- Overturn Citizens United and SpeechNow decisions.
- Crack down on foreign influence on our elections (laundering, SuperPAC engagement, foreign lobbyists such as AIPAC).
- Implement Publicly Funded Elections (or a Clean Elections model)

**2) Education on Critical-Thinking and Navigating Media**

- Teach Americans how to spot Formal and Informal fallacies in news & opinion.
- Give Americans a rubric for distinguishing truly Fake news from Real News. 


Like I want to see ads that *inform*; speeches that teach. Adopt the Katie Porter style of engaging the electorate with a whiteboard.

If we don't address these things, then powerful interests will undermine the entire point of Democracies around the world with large megaphones that drown out the voices of the many while the uninformed and disengaged fall prey to sleazy snakeoil tactics.",2024_10_31

But, he’s a moron so, he took the opposite route, luckily.

I mean the pandemic was bad, but most people thought of it as something inflicted on the US from outside. The ""honk for first responders"" made us feel good. People were able to work from home, which was really cool.  Folks got dogs (that they later abandoned when they had to go back to the office, but that is another story).

I have no idea why I'm being downvoted. What would be good enough? Public self-flagellation? Giving away everything he has? Ending his own life? 

He admitted he was wrong and made a statement. We should be welcoming when cult members find the guts to exit. That's the  ***only*** way we can fix this toxic social milieu in a manner fitting of a civilized people.

There's a really fucking good reason why experts (sociologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, political scientists, religious studies experts etc etc) on cults and exit strategies absolutely loathe the phrase ""deprogramming"". Much like getting through an addiction, the only way someone can truly leave a cult is when they choose to do so themselves. And language like ""deprogramming"" takes away their agency before they could even find it to begin with. 

When someone exits a cult and all they hear is ""haha leopards ate your face, you totally deserve it"", they have two options: 1) go towards people reveling in their suffering or 2) go back to the cult. I know this means ZERO to anyone reading, but from 2020-when Elon took over, I was part of a group on Twitter who helped people exit the QAnon cult. Denigrating people when they admit they're wrong, even if it's to save their reputation publicly, doesn't help. It's still a step, no matter how much of a baby step it is.

Seriously, this is way bigger than Nicky Jam; if Harris wins, we have some serious work to do and that involves having empathy for those who exit the MAGA cult and not laughing in their face.",2024_10_31

I’ve canvassed for elections in Canada here. Our political machines got nothing on America’s and I’m a noob. The most I’ve done was ~30 doors in 2.5 hours. 1000 doors a week is…. what???,2024_10_31
"For some context, I worked on a race in 2022. Splitting my time between Door Knocking and phone calls, I was expected to knock 50 doors a day, 6 days a week. If these guys are working 7 days a week, 8 hour shifts, they could only hit their goal if they knocked a door every 3.35 minutes, for 8 hours straight, without a break. Physically impossible anyone is actually hitting these numbers.",2024_10_31

Trump's campaign has been so low on funds for so long they basically bailed on the ground effort part. Just rallies where they leave unpaid bills. That's why this last ditch half-assed canvassing scam fell to Elon. The whole thing smells funny and would land people in prison in any functioning democracy.,2024_10_31
"Trump doesn’t have a ground game, signs of badly ran campaign",2024_10_31

"Very few people I’ve canvassed feel that way, tho I did have one guy tell me what I was doing was dangerous and what if his wife or 16-year old daughter were home alone when I knocked on his door. Plus a lot of people in our area at least have Ring cameras and a few of them are probably home but don’t answer the door. 

You can always tell the canvasser you’re not interested in participating, they’ll thank you and note Refused in the app which will alert the campaign not to come to your house again.

"My wife refuses to vote in person because we were harassed in 2020. A crazy Trump supporter who had set up in the parking lot followed us to our car yelling at us about us not supporting Trump. Luckily I recorded the interaction, because she called the sheriff and said i threatened her with a gun. So on my way home I got pulled over by the sheriff at gunpoint. I showed them the video and was released, but the Trump supporting sheriff wouldn’t let me press charges against her. She was a local politicians wife so I have been told by people who watched the video.

Edit: I also reported her to the polling place for voter intimidation and they said they couldn’t do anything because she was far enough away that it was legal.",2024_10_31

Involuntary manslaughter is the more correct charge against Cruz and other Republicans who knowingly passed laws and nominated justices who did this.

Criminally negligent Homicide is the Texas charge.

https://versustexas.com/difference-between-murder-manslaughter-and-criminally-negligent-homicide/

But it only applies in the following situation, ""A person commits an offense if they cause the death of an individual by criminal negligence.""

That's defined as ""A person acts with criminal negligence, or is criminally negligent, with respect to the result of their conduct when they ought to be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that an ordinary person would exercise under all the circumstances as viewed from the actor’s standpoint.""

So, individuals within Texas, who knew about the harms that were forecast by doctors, and *Knowingly* passed laws that would do this, are completely guilty under the Texas legal framework.",2024_10_31

"Yes, but it requires 2 things for those charges to stick.

1. An Attorney General who's willing to prosecute a politician for that (usually someone who does that sort of thing only does so when a majority of a party backs them, if they enact something like that into law).

2. Conduct so egregious that the legal doctrine of ""Absolute Immunity"" doesnt apply. It's a legal doctrine that was put in place to prevent a politician from getting sued by everyone directly impacted by their laws/rulings, but has been grossly abused to such an extent, that i wouldnt be surprised to see it nearly nullified in the resulting implosion of the Republican party that's effectively inevitable. You normally have to prove that the conduct was so egregious that they no longer qualify for any protection of their office.

For part 1, good luck with that. Only a State AG can levy state charges like that, and in Texas, they definitely wont. For part 2, that depends on a jury. If I was on a jury, and i was presented with a scenario where a politician deliberately and willfully ignored what the majority of both domestic and foreign policy experts said to do, and knowing it would cause harm, for no appreciable gain, then yes, I would absolutely vote to convict.",2024_10_31

"Here's a link to their full endorsement article: [A second Trump term comes with unacceptable risks](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/10/31/a-second-trump-term-comes-with-unacceptable-risks)

> By making Mr Trump leader of the free world, Americans would be gambling with the economy, the rule of law and international peace. We cannot quantify the chance that something will go badly wrong: nobody can. But we believe voters who minimise it are deluding themselves.

> The case against Mr Trump begins with his policies. In 2016 the Republican platform was still caught between the Mitt Romney party and the Trump party. Today’s version is more extreme. Mr Trump favours a 20% tariff on all imports and has talked of charging over 200% or even 500% on cars from Mexico. He proposes to deport millions of irregular immigrants, many with jobs and American children. He would extend tax cuts even though the budget deficit is at a level usually seen only during war or recession, suggesting a blithe indifference to sound fiscal management.

> The risks for domestic and foreign policy are amplified by the last big difference between Mr Trump’s first term and a possible second one: he would be less constrained. The president who mused about firing missiles at drug labs in Mexico was held back by the people and institutions around him. Since then the Republican Party has organised itself around fealty to Mr Trump. Friendly think-tanks have vetted lists of loyal people to serve in the next administration. The Supreme Court has weakened the checks on presidents by ruling that they cannot be prosecuted for official acts.

> If external constraints are looser, much more will depend on Mr Trump’s character. Given his unrepentant contempt for the constitution after losing the election in 2020, it is hard to be optimistic. Half his former cabinet members have refused to endorse him. The most senior Republican senator describes him as a “despicable human being”. Both his former chief-of-staff and former head of the joint chiefs call him a fascist. If you were interviewing a job applicant, you would not brush off such character references.

The biggest expectation of a second Trump presidency is that the full force of the federal government (including the DOD) will be turned against Trump's perceived enemies.

Financial and economic takes on politics don't generally judge politicians by social issues - they judge them on how it will impact the markets, the economy, small and large businesses, banking, returns, etc. 

It's why many people try to clarify that they are ""fiscal conservatives"" - to distance themselves from the social implications. It's as if they are saying ""I'll happily fly a pride flag outside my shop and employ women at equal pay, but at the end of the day it's my shop that I'm voting for""

Is that because they want women to have rights or because gay and trans people are allowed to exist? Or is it because brown people exist? There’s no rational reason for your statement,2024_10_31
This is a point ok,2024_10_31
I'm speaking about individuals not political parties.,2024_10_31
"Lots of posters just think the name must mean conservative or something but they act very authoritative in their responses. It's classically liberal and always has been, for the most part leans whatever direction of current center that fits that view point. It's also probably the last weekly news magazine worth reading and hasn't destroyed it's legacy like most others.",2024_10_31
"As a subscriber through the Bush years and again their unapologetic support of him and the war in Iraq, I respectfully disagree and stick to my original comment.",2024_10_31
They would be OK with Trump being a fascist. They have an issue with the UNSTABLE aspect of him.,2024_10_31
That’s excellent! On a related tangent… I wonder what would Lenin think about Putin’s billionaires,2024_10_31
"Good on you for being willing to admit a mistake and learn from it! Sincerely, all too rare a quality, especially on the Internet. ",2024_10_31
"The fact that Wall Street hasn't been satisfied with all time highs for the last two years under Biden is ridiculous. Realistically Trump can't juice the market that much more than it is already humming along AND he adds significant uncertainty at every stage. 

Political stability is the foundation of economic success. It genuinely feels like they're unhappy that a rising tide lifts all boats instead of just singularly lifting the wealthiest. And that metaphor almost doesn't work because the market is only really participated in by folks with the wealth to do so, so it already heavily skews upward.",2024_10_31
"Honestly, as an outsider I can assure you she is very centrist on a scale of worldwide leaders, and waaaay more likely to benefit you and your children compared to the alternative.",2024_10_31
Yes but your anecdotal opinion is being applied to the whole of British conservatism though.,2024_10_31
"If you're a subscriber, did you forget they endorsed John Kerry in 2004 when Bush was up for reelection while Iraq 2: Electric Bugaloo raged?

Did you forget they endorsed Obama in 2008?

Did you forget they endorsed Obama again in 2012?

Did you forget they endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016?

Did you forget they endorsed Joe Biden in 2020?

But thanks for disagreeing respectfully.",2024_10_31
"Wouldn’t know, I just find it funny that a criticism against that magazine from 1915 still holds.",2024_10_31
One of the problems is Wall Street can bet on the sinking of the Dollar and make a killing off that.,2024_10_31
"Because they're moved farther right than 20 years ago, collectively, have they not? The citizenry and the representation?",2024_10_31
"Not really no. Yes the party has been trying to appeal to the hard right recently (because of Brexit, but it's complicated), but that ended with them being wiped out in the last election.",2024_10_31

"> When taking the stage at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, still wearing the neon vest, Trump began by referencing Biden: “250 million Americans are not garbage.” Notably, approximately 335 million people live in the United States.

335M minus 250M = 85M

Trump got roughly 75M votes last time.  Math checks out.",2024_10_31

These idiots could have used an AI to generate the same images at no cost, and they want us to think they can run the country efficiently?

Also…Joe Biden isn’t the candidate.  He isn’t the candidate anymore specifically because he can’t control what he says anymore.  You’re not campaigning against Biden.

"Yeah. Am I really supposed to believe that there's any kind of actual outrage that a candidate's supporters are being called names. Literally days ago, at the Madison Square Garden rally, Trump said:

>We’re running against something far bigger than Joe or Kamala and far more powerful than them, which is a massive, vicious, crooked, radical left machine that runs today’s Democrat Party. They’re just vessels. In fact, they’re perfect vessels because they’ll never give them a hard time. They’ll do whatever they want. I know many of them. It’s just this amorphous group of people. But they’re smart and they’re vicious. And we have to defeat them.

>And when I say the enemy from within, the other side goes crazy, becomes a sound hole. How can he say now they’ve done very bad things to this country? **They are indeed the enemy from within.** But this is who we’re fighting. These are the people who are doing such harm to our country with their open border policies, record setting inflation, Green New Deal scam and everything else that they’re doing.

Yes, that's right. Trump, out of his own fucking mouth, called Democrats ""the enemy from within"". 

And earlier this month, during his interview with Maria Bartiromo, Trump said:

> I think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they're the - and it should be very easily handled by - if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military.

Put it together and it sure sounds like Trump is perfectly ok with using the military to ""handle"" Democrats.

"A not so insignificant part of the rise of fascism is the corruption of the media by consolidated capitalist and foreign interests, and the siloing of ideas in social media.

Never before has the American media so brazenly misinformed the public to line the pockets of a handful. The consolidation of media companies into the control of a handful of billionaires has minimized the free and diverse exchange of ideas. The agenda is dictated by the political beliefs of a few owners, and/or to increase consumption for more ad sales.

Never before could huge swaths of the public be radicalized unknowingly by consuming what they thought was an open and free platform. The reality is that social media platforms, which are increasingly consolidated into the hands of a few billionaires, are being manipulated for the same reasons that the media has been corrupted. To further the political agenda of the owners, and/or to increase consumption for more ad sales.

If we want to fix this, we can either break up these mega companies that have a monopoly on the narrative, or better yet, pass modernized laws that better protect the truth against misinformation and propaganda.

Whatever is contributing more to the rise of fascism is up for debate, but I think our sources of information being corrupted plays a large role in all of this.

As a Canadian, I have no idea what moderate liberalism is when used by presumably an American. So I can’t comment on that.",2024_10_31

Also, whether the entirety of Project 2025 is implemented or not, his administration will still have purged federal agencies of dissidence. Trump himself is hardly the mastermind behind this. There’s a lot more planning involved this time around, which is why this is so consequential.

On top of that, a lot of the in-party figures who dissented against him the first time are either gone (McCain, Cheney, Sasse, Flake) or on their way out (Romney). That he didn't even participate in the debates and handily won nomination shows how much the party has lined up behind him.

> Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein continues to lead Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson by double digits in the race for North Carolina governor, a WRAL News Poll released Wednesday shows - a marked gap, considering the race for president is tied in this battleground state.

> The WRAL poll shows nearly one in every five Trump supporters backing Stein for governor.

> WRAL&#039;s latest poll, conducted after the Elon and Marist polls - and which shows almost no change in support for either Stein or Robinson since before that CNN report - suggests that some voters who had cooled on Robinson may have moved past the allegations.

"Yeah, it just doesn’t make sense to me that Trump is running so far ahead of the normie Senate candidates in swing states.

"Agreed. And so we must ask ourselves what’s more likely: that all these other polls are wrong, or that the presidential polls are?

Presidential polls also have the general election numbers that can be used to smooth the outliers.

All things being considered, I think the presidential polls are jacked and the real story is being told in gubernatorial, senate, and non-swing state and other polls. She’s polling better on every single issue, including the economy. She’s closing gaps in deep red states like Kansas, Iowa, and Alaska, she’s within striking distance in Texas. Democrats are up in every other statewide election in every swing state. She’s out raising him and has far more small donors. She’s picked up record endorsements from the opposing party.

">Why is their messaging so all over the place?

Different voters have different single issues. In some places you have Bill Clinton talking about bicycles. Do you think bicycles should be all the campaign talks about?  

> “I still don’t think most people know the Democrats favored the immigration bill,” he said. “I think if they did know it would make a difference.”
> 
> “And we’re talking about Haitian immigrants eating pets?” Bill Clinton asked, receiving a round of supportive that’s-right murmurs and amens. “And apparently there’s no price for this.”
> 
> In just a few sentences, the former president encapsulated the difficulty of running against an opponent who has effectively broken the American political system. 
> 
> Nobody knows better than Clinton that Republicans pay the heaviest political price when they threaten already-conferred, broadly held and deeply popular programs like Social Security, Medicare or, more recently, the expanded health benefits signed into law by Presidents Obama and Biden. Decades of winning Democratic campaigns demonstrate ***the maxim that Americans may be rhetorically conservative but are operationally liberal when it comes to the role of government.***
> 
> When I asked him if he would like to run for another term himself, he humbly deferred.
> 
> “I like to see younger people do it,” Clinton said, before quickly adding: “I like being asked to help because I can say what I believe.”
> 
> He used stops in Fayetteville, Wilson, Greenville and Rocky Mount to don his title of what Barack Obama called “Secretary of Explaining Stuff.” Clinton rolled through the importance of legal immigration, the role of grocery store ownership concentration in food prices and got heads nodding at one stop by explaining the impact of supply chain bottlenecks on inflation this way:
> 
> “Suppose there were three bicycles in Wilson and everybody rode a bicycle and every one of you wanted one,” he said. “Think it would drive the price of the three up? That’s all that happened, and it happened everywhere in the world.”
> 
> Oh, and did they know Russia and Ukraine produce 30 percent of the world’s wheat? So when Moscow invaded its neighbor, the global price of that valuable commodity shot up, he explained.
> 
> What I find most compelling about Clinton, though, is less the MasterClass tutorials and more the tight lines. His most memorable one from the Democratic convention last summer was about Trump. “Don’t count the lies, count the I’s,” he said.
> 
> Last weekend, Clinton trotted out that one and a few more.
> 
> Reminding voters about how they demonstrate caring by showing up for funerals, he argued: “Voting is showing up for your country.”
> 
> Contrasting Harris with Trump, he said: “If you hire somebody to run the country, you want her to make it better, not to make you madder.”",2024_10_31

Bring it home guys, it's just a few days away and if we can really do this, ***can you imagine the implosion that will inevitably happen with the Republican party after yet another Presidential loss?

If we win the Presidential this year, it will then make it so the only Presidential term they had was with Trump for a mere 4 years which will then be forever sandwiched in between *8 years* of Democrats **before** Trump and another **8 years** of Democrats *after*.

Do you think the Republican party is seriously just going to go ""back to business""? Trump's crimes and his cases that he's only been able to stall, will finally come to fruition and he'll have nowhere else to go. **Because of this** he is guaranteed to state (publicly and privately and through official paperwork) as soon as humanly possible that he will actually be running for President in 2028. It's the only ""feasible"" move he can do to try and stall shit in court moreso. I mean it likely won't work, he exhausted most of it out, but never stopped the actual charges or the cases in the first place.

He's going to need all that free ""ad/mind space"" in front of as many eyes as possible and he's not going to want any other Republican coming along, winning and then showing the world how much easier it was for **that** Republican to win than him. **Republicans are legit stuck with him**.

If we win this time, he's literally going to be a permanent problem for them and a fading problem for everyone else. This is why Graham said Trump would destroy the GOP. It's because he knew 100% that the party would....simply just let it happen. He didn't think Trump was some brilliant demolitions expert, he *knew* that the entire Republican party (including himself) would simply jump at the chance to suck down Trump's gravy.

Graham was actually being honest about *himself*, not about Trump (in that famous Tweet). Let's crush this one and send these dipshits packing. His (obvious, even at the time) projection came through in where he directed his blame: ""HE will destroy the GOP"". He actually **meant** ""we're going to let him"".

This is what I’ve been saying. I do have a theory that the polls are underrepresenting the blue vote mostly due to their methods of reaching people.

We’ll just have to vote of course and then wait and see what happens.,2024_10_31

Now I'm not suggesting the polls that make it in the paper are like this. But I think those kind of fake polls have discouraged anyone who thinks critically from answering any polls at all.

But of course this doesn't really capture what newly registered voters are going to look like, nor what turnout is going to look like. Polls underestimated Trump in a huge way because Trump activated a lot of new and lower propensity voters and had this huge enthusiasm gap. 


But what do the new voters looks like this year? It's hard to say. A lot more people register unaffiliated than in the past, a lot of young people lean dem but not as hard as in the past... It's totally possible polls could be way underestimating Harris and she seems to have a good amount of enthusiasm behind her especially with women.

My theory has been the media is intentionally keeping this looking as close as possible because conflict is what drives every single thing you see on television.

And when you also consider that this is the first Presidential election in a post-Roe America, these polling outlets, for whatever reason, keep underestimating just how furious women are.  And while the media continues to put more emphasis on young men siding with people like Trump, Elon, Joe Rogan, Andrew Tate, etc., the young women in this country are becoming more and more progressive.  And those young women, whose livelihoods are quite literally on the line now, are much more likely to vote than young men.",2024_10_31
"I'm still a big believer in that what turns elections is not persuading people to vote one way or the other but to VOTE. Apathy is the killer, and Trump (and Rs generally) get in because of that; hardly anyone votes, their base /always/ does. You get normal people energized enough to take an hour out of their year and vote and there's a massive surge of Ds generally, Harris handily gets in.

GOP knows this: see all their vote suppression work, including from the USSC just today.

Back to polling... no polls seriously estimate enthusiasm and it's hard to gauge anyway. SOME hints of that with polling for issues, say the '22 Kansas anti-abortion referendum where the few polls (it is just Kansas) were clear passage, but... enthusiasm (how strong support was for each position) painted a different picture if you looked close and nearly Two Million voted! Under 3 million live here, including children and coma patients! Basically everyone voted and even western kansas fire engine red voted it into defeat.",2024_10_31

But what the pollsters are saying is they are accounting for that in other ways (oversampling, weighing, etc). I hope they overaccounted and are now sampling too many Trump voters. But as much as its easy to hate on pollsters its impossible to totally predict turnout in advance. So who knows? Find out in a few days",2024_10_31

>Trump is now +41 points among white men without college degrees, essentially matching his showing in this group in the 2020 ABC News exit poll, and also +41 points among rural voters.

>The shift toward Harris among likely voters relies in part on consolidated support among Democratic base groups, notably Black people and liberals. While Harris has a 70-point advantage among all Black people, that widens to 83 points among Black likely voters, 90-7%. Ninety-six percent of liberal likely voters support Harris, vs. 91% of liberals overall. Additionally, she goes from 53% support among all suburban women to 59% among those likely to vote. Trump, by contrast, doesn't see significant bumps in support among likely voters.

That’s means if that fails (which it will), then the moderates have a window to seize control of the party again. But at that point would they want it? The GOP would be coming off 3 consecutive losses with 2 generations only Republican Presidential memories being Bush Jr. and Trump.

My concern is less that “oh no, another grifter on man what’s tricking the rubes” and more, there are a lot of competent assholes who watched as he pressed against the barriers time and time again with no pushback. Things that were just taken for granted are now shown to be illusory. Our press has failed us, many of our elected representatives cowtowed and failed us. The Supreme Court (mostly) acts like it’s a part of his campaign. 

What happens when a smarter, folksier, more driven person takes office? That’s my concern. We like;y won’t see another Trump like person in our lifetime, but that doesn’t lower the stakes when you see just how many of our fellow citizens WANT a dictatorship. WANT a taliban like nation. That’s the truly scary part. Trump’s a fucking idiot who can’t get out of his own way. He’s sundowning, he’s got some obvious health issues (he needs two hands to drink water? Come on).

Here's one that is trying to make a different point about perception of statistical accuracy but on the way indicates some actual trends in polling.

Non-statistical sources of error are the whole problem we're talking about here; the researcher (or research analyst most likely) /chooses/ how much weight to assign to a number of hard to get a handle on sources of inaccuracy, and generally choose the narrowest as a sort of conservatism I disagree with, but which also has the result of making survey / poll results look more accurate than they are. 

So to that article, 60% of political polls (in the last week) now have election results not just not what was predicted (opposite candidate / issue wins) but outside the confidence interval for that direction. 

Polls are hugely less accurate than they appear to be. As are many other types of research surveys. We must fall back on the quote:

"I was about to make the same point, thank you for wording it so well.


My hunch would've been that relative to the average American I'm informed about scams, security, etc., & I'm in the camp of silencing unknown numbers & ignoring texts about polls just as much as other spam texts. Trump's whole grift seems painfully transparent to me, & I'd expect people who trust him & buy his wildly overvalued DJT stock or bibles or whatever, to on average be more likely to engage with unknown numbers, & specifically with polling requests in order to express their support for Trump.


I know there's the ""shy Trump voter"" theory to attempt to explain 2016 & 2020, but anecdotally my Trump supporting friends & neighbors are not shy about it. Perhaps that's not representative of Trump voters as a whole, or there's been a shift between '16 & '24 though...


Because I'm trying to see why polls would suddenly be off in the other direction when they understated Trump's support more in '20 than '16. Idk what the response rate was in '20, but it's reasonable to assume it was below 9% on the way down to 0.4%. It wouldn't make intuitive sense that the 9% that respond would be slightly less Republican, the 3% that respond are *much* less so, then down at 0.4% they suddenly skew Republican...


That seems to weaken the case for my hunch/hope, but I know any actual factors from '16 to '20 to '24 could just be overpowered by the noise of variability. It's just the polls have not been wildly inconsistent with each other this year, so I'm interested what everyone might be getting wrong in one direction or the other. Last night I asked GPT to pretend it's a week after the election & Harris greatly outperformed polls, & to explain the most likely cause(s). It provided a thorough breakdown, but overall it was more about late shifts in turnout among specific demographics than the polls being off all along. ",2024_10_31

If 25 years ago they had to call 5,000 people in Kansas to get the 1,000 people in Kansas necessary to be the representative sample and now they have to call 15,000 people to get the necessary 1,000 people it doesnt matter.  So long as they get the representative 1,000 people thats all that matter.    Theyre still getting the same representative sample just not as easily

"Very good point; that was possibly the worst link to have used, as it never explicitly mentions cellphones. My bad. Here are some more that directly address the question:

[Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/110383/does-gallup-call-cell-phones.aspx)

>Gallup includes cellphones in each national Gallup poll. Gallup has been including cellphone-only households in all national telephone Gallup polls since January 2008. Further, cellphone-only households are now as likely to fall into national Gallup polls samples as those living in traditional landline households.

[New York  Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/upshot/midterms-polling-phone-calls.html)

>What about cellphones? Finally, an easy one: We call cellphones and landlines! About three-quarters of our calls go to cellphones nowadays — including nearly every call to young people.

[Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2018/10/09/performance-of-the-samples/)

>A look at the cellphones dialed in the RBS and RDD surveys provides a more apple-to-apples comparison. In both surveys, when calling a cellphone number, interviewers attempted to complete the survey with whomever answered the phone provided that the person was age 18 or older. The cellphone response rate was 6% in both surveys.

[Marist](https://maristpoll.marist.edu/methods/)

>Currently, more than half of our national sample is obtained from a mobile telephone frame. Proportions may be adjusted in state and city projects based on cell-phone-only populations from the most current National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Wireless Substitution Estimates. Mobile phones are treated as individual devices. After validation of age, personal ownership, and non-business-use of the mobile phone, interviews are typically conducted with the person answering the phone.

[PBS](https://www.pbs.org/publiceditor/blogs/pbs-public-editor/the-problem-with-polls/)

>The Associated Press guidelines, to which PBS NewsHour adheres, use the known probability standard — the one Marist uses.  Polls that rely on a random sample of a population in which every member has a known probability of inclusion, “are known as probability-based polls, and they are the best method of ensuring the results of a survey reflect the true opinion of the group being surveyed,” the AP Stylebook 2022 edition states. 

>The AP, and Marist, recognize that a plurality of American adults do not have a landline. Polls that are “conducted by telephone must include people interviewed on their cellphones,” according to the Stylebook. “Those that only include landline interviews have no chance of reaching the more than half of American adults who have only a mobile phone.” 

[Quinnipiac](https://poll.qu.edu/methodology/)

"Technically yes, they can't be wrong if they are going by percentages. That said, you assess how consistently the model they are running (for weathermen) or the survey they are running (surveyors) gets it wrong, and how often they are statistically significant wrong. Did they miss wildly, or was it simply sometimes it breaks that way, like, for instance if I say there is 84% chance I roll something other than 6. If I then roll a 6, was I wrong or did the statistically unlikely event happen? 

And as every surveyor says, they aren't dealing with static, totally rational subjects. People change their minds, lie, etc. Plus, they are merely snapshots in time.",2024_10_31

"""Competent"" in the sense of ""he can keep a lid on his shit and operate strategically to advance his agenda,"" not in the sense of actually being good.

There was a comment the other day where they showed what he said at various speeches and then linked to actual hitler speeches where trump was literally patterning his speech after hitler. Like literally copying hitler and afaik not reported in the media. WTF,2024_10_31
"As I recall hitlers version in the late 1930s was “I have the right to remove millions of an inferior race that breed like vermin”. By which he meant communist, marxist, jews, the gays, the infirm, and anyone from a country that he didn’t consider “of the German people”.

Of all the analog statements trumps made this is probably the one that’s been changed from its base form the most. However, when you put it next to *all the other statements that are basically direct quotes* it shows quite a pattern. 

As a student of history hearing a popularist refer to himself as “their retribution” while also referring to people he disagrees with or doesn’t like as “the enemy within”, “scum of the nation”, and “animals” instead of dog people chills me to my core.

Hell his comments about how if we don’t get “those people back where they came from” we will “lose our culture” are *literally* from mein kamph",2024_10_31

-Bit over half are white (not good)

I would imagine. Harris has the bigger appeal to younger voters (if they’re this crowd) but Trump’s approval never reaches 50%. So I would think these new voters are younger (because older people likely would have voted in years past and are not new voters) and 50% or more leans Harris.

Early voting isn't *always* favorable to Democrats. Nevada is a good example, where it skews very far to the GOP. Other states are similar.

The historical Republican advantage and what made them competitive during the Reagan/Bush years was that they dominated the suburbs similar to how Dems dominate the cities.  Under Trump there has been a realignment that has made him and Republicans (a nationalist/populist) a little more competitive in the cities with certain demographics and more dominant in rural areas but the trade off has been a fairly steep decline in support in the suburbs particularly among women.   Essentially the Republican base has shifted from mostly college educated suburban whites who are more likely to vote to lower educated blue collar whites who are more in number but lower propensity voters.   Republicans will still win a good share of suburban voters but more and more cities have shifted to where the inner suburbs are turning blue/purple leaving only the outer suburbs as reliably red.,2024_10_31

Certainly not over but the more people vote the bigger that margin will be. Republicans are more consistent voters. That's why they hate making voting easier.

Edit:  Read that wrong.  It's 1/2 million.  Not 1/2.  So 3% lean for Harris would be greater than the margin in 2020 out of that group.",2024_10_31

Trumps magic touch was getting out new/low propensity voters in 2016.  He got those same voters out in 2020.


The problem is that Trump has theoretically hit a ceiling with that though and the availability of new voters and low propensity voters is much higher for Democrats.


Higher Turnout benefitted Trump because it was higher than before.  But if we can exceed the current level and reach even higher turnout, then the pendulum swings back to favoring Democrats.

If we somehow manage to hold on to the government and the stolen courts don't just hand it over to Trump and the spineless democrats don't concede or, I don't know, blood in the streets doesn't happen from these lunatics, they'll be back. This is not the end.  We're, right now, butting up at the endgame of what they want and they're not going to give up. Every 2 years, they're going to be trying to take the house and senate. Every 4, they're going to be trying to take the presidency. Whether they have Trump in 4 years, who the fuck knows - but they'll have someone. It remains to be seen if the rubes will follow someone else - they have to strike while the iron is hot because Trump commands the 'populist' attention to his base.

But it's a double sided sword. Trump is a cult leader now. He is the GOP. Who knows what happens when he's gone - we have no idea if they can wangle it. Trump clearly is trying to create a dynasty with Don Jr. And Barron, but no one really likes Don. Jr (MAGA just finds him a good source of news) and Barron is too young.

Silent Majority. A lot of people tired of Trump do not shout out loud that they will vote for Harris. Same with democrats. Election is tiring. A lot of rational people made their decision very early to vote but will stay away from political commentary. Those people would probably not being polled.,2024_10_31
"So if you look at the math, there is an almost zero percent chance of all the polls being so tight.  In a theoretical actual 50-50 election, if you conducted 100 different polls from a sample population, you would expect to get about 10% of them that said it was tied, about 40% that said it was Kamala between +1 and +4 and about 40%  that said it was Trump between +1 and +4. The rest would be even bigger splits. If you want, you can do this yourself.  Take a coin, and flip it 100 times, recording the result.  While you would expect a 50-50 result, in practice a 50-50 result is actually really rare.

The fact that we are seeing all the polls so tightly bounded very strongly suggests the pollsters are adjusting their weighting to skew the results towards the middle because they don't want to be seen as outliers. 

With the coin flip example, say you got 47 heads and 53 tails.  You wouldn't want to say your flip sample is tails +6, because you know that people would look at you and call you a crackpot (especially if every other coin flipper reports 50-50).  So you then say your flipping methodology has a +2 tails bias and the real results are really tails+2, which is more in line with what everyone else is saying.",2024_10_31

"Voting for a candidate who opposes your core values—even if they seem like the ""lesser evil""—is inherently compromising of your integrity. And it reinforces harmful policies that diminish meaningful political choice. Harris has stated she was involved in all of the major decisions of Biden and she stated she wouldn't have done much differently. She may not be as hard core Zionist as Biden, but she's made clear that Jewish lives count for more than Arab ones and that she unequivocally supports the far right Netanyahu government. 

So by supporting someone who stands against your interests, you may inadvertently normalize values you oppose, which weakens your moral stance and which can erode your credibility. How do you maintain a moral credibility voting for someone that is supporting a government that is engaging in ethnic cleansing? Voting for candidates that are against your interests and values also risks entrenching a system that forces voters into narrow, negative choices, allowing politicians to ignore real concerns by banking on fear of ""the other side."" And that's exactly what has happened in this election.

Instead, abstaining from a harmful choice can send a powerful message. It asserts the demand for genuine representation and challenges a system where only marginally different options are presented. In the long run, this strategy can create space for alternatives and strengthen democracy by insisting that political choices reflect true values, not just the ""lesser evil.""


Voting under the ""threat"" of  Trump presidency ultimately validates a system that exploits fear rather than offering genuine choices. Accepting this cycle can lead to continuously supporting candidates who don’t represent your values, as the system never faces the pressure to change.

Moreover, a political stance built on fear is inherently unsustainable and vulnerable. Lasting change often requires principled stands, even if they’re risky or unpopular in the short term. By withholding support from those who harm your interests, you’re challenging the system to prioritize genuine solutions over mere expediency, opening the door for future options that align with your beliefs and aspirations. Sometimes, true progress demands a willingness to resist the immediate pressure for the sake of a better path forward.",2024_10_31

"What does good actually look like for the Palestinians? Let's be realistic.

They had an excellent opportunity for peace at the Camp David Accords and Arafat and his leadership walked away fearing assassination for giving up the Palestinian the right to return. That group of Palestinian leaders is the closest they've ever had to real statesmen who could build a country.

I’m not condoning what Israel/Bibi has done to prevent a two state solution since 2003. It’s bad for Israel and the Palestinians and wrong. The Israel's have absolutely built an apartheid state. But in doing so they did end the terrorist threat that flared up in the West Bank after the Palestinians rejected Camp David.

Since then terrorism has overwhelmed the Palestinian ability to self-govern and find peace in Gaza. But what do you do when the terrorists are democratically elected and keep being terrorists?

I'm not saying they all are in this position, but what do you do with the only ""refugee"" population in the world legally allowed to inheret their refugee status while never having even visited Palestine and living in peace in other countries? What do you do with a population that will only accept peace via the right to return (and thus demanding the destruction of the Israeli state) through inherence? It doesn't exist anywhere else in the world and is what perpetuates this conflict.

I respect Palestinian agency and will not infantilize them. The Palestinians know exactly what they are doing supporting Hamas and rejecting the Palestinian Authority. The UN has uniquely given the Palestinians every reason to wait out the Israeli's and continue applying pain through terrorism in a legal structure the UN has denied every other victimized group in the world.

It's not a conflict the Palestinians will ever win, but they can keep it going forever.

In response, what the Israelis have done is allow themselves to survive this Palestinian refusal for a durable and separate peace in perpetuity by creating an apartheid state in the West Bank. They've made themselves mostly invulnerable to terrorism in the West Bank and we're now watching them do the same in Gaza.

I'm not saying that bringing West Bank style apartheid occupation to Gaza is right or ""peace."" But it would be the first time since 2006 that Gaza would have a chance to be ruled by the Palestinian Authority again and not a terrorist organization. It'll be the first time in a long time that a terrorist organization wasn't the core of their economy.

No final peace can happen until the PA has total control of Gaza and Hamas is ended not just by Israeli violence but also the Palestinian desire to be governed by the organization that can be their national government if they allow it to be and accept that they will never return to what is now Israel.

If you don't believe it's reasonable to demand Palestinians give up their right to return in exchange for statehood, then we'll continue seeing this play out until our kids are old and gray. Anyone who believes that it is possible to have a power sharing government between Jews and Muslims is ignoring the history of Lebanon, whose chance for peace is even more remote than Palestine's

US aid (in the form of weapons sales) has less impact than people think. Israel’s domestic arms industry is enormous and top notch. If Biden did what people demand and cut off US weapons, we would lose much of what little leverage we have left over them forever, just like the Germans and Italians have. It’s inevitable and will happen anyway in the next 5-10 years. The Israel’s have gotten the message from US politics and are already building the infrastructure they need to be minimally impacted by a future US President who tries to control Israeli policy via weapons sales. All our aid will be good for then is US domestic job creation and balancing the Israeli budget.

The only way out of this perpetual cycle is enabling the Palestinians to choose a durable peace when they have NEVER chosen peace since the 1930s. Wiping out Hamas and Hezbollah and establishing an apartheid state in Gaza are only the prerequisites to getting back on the path to real diplomacy. Otherwise we'll just keep seeing the same shit happen forever.

There is a reason why the UNRWA and the UN and teachers in Gaza are teaching little children to hate Jewish people. There is a reason why they are attack on Jewish people all over the world. That has nothing to do with the conflict other than being Jewish.

Ever not been able to afford medical care or taken care of patients who have to make a choice as whether to seek medical care because of their immigration status or financial status. Ever had crushing student debt? Ever tried to feed a family of four or pay for childcare? Ever breastfed or tried to get paid for maternity leave? Ever tried to get paid a living wage? Ever taken care of, been involved with or been yourself unhomed? Ever been impacted by gun violence? Given your comment, single-issue voter stance and lack of foresight - I find it hard to believe.

"As for core values, I can only speak for myself. But it's clear Harris does not view all lives as being equal. When asked about the atrocious death toll and destruction waged on the Palestinian people by Israel, she responded by saying *""the first and most tragic story is October 7 and what happened on that day"".* That was revealing because it crystalized how she views this. 45,000 plus Palestinians dead, including a majority of women and children but she says the ""the most"" tragic story is the 1200 Israelis that were killed. 

It's 100% clear to anyone that cares to pay attention that Israel is engaging in [ethnic cleansing in the north of Gaza](https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20241022_the_world_must_stop_the_ethnic_cleansing_of_northern_gaza). They are literally rounding people up under threat of death, [separating the women and children from the men](https://youtu.be/ORgVPO8OSis?si=s-XPbhp30wtvHpjO) and loading them into buses. We can only imagine what happens to the men or ""terrorists"" as Israel is calling them. This is literally what the Serbs did in Srebrenica, Bosnia - which caused outrage across the western world. And the response of Harris to this has been to affirm her commitment to Israel. And to approve of sending more weapons. I can't stress enough just how diametrically opposed this position is to my values. How can any government justify this kind of dehumanizing treatment of innocent Palestinians? And Harris isn't just not opposing it, she is tacitly at least supporting it. 

The reality is there is almost no choice in this election when it comes to the middle east. Across the board, there are few politicians in Washington that dare oppose Israel. But voting for someone that is not actively resisting or using their position to try and stop the violence and death being waged on innocent women and children is just unbearable. It would undermine every core value I hold dear. And it would, in my opinion, just affirm a system that provides no choice on this issue. 

 Responsibility in a democracy goes beyond simply choosing the least harmful candidate. Real responsibility involves standing for values, demanding accountability, and pushing the system toward genuine representation. Voting solely out of fear of the “greater evil” may seem practical, but it can also perpetuate a cycle of harmful choices and lower the bar for what’s acceptable in leadership.

True democratic responsibility might mean resisting candidates who oppose your values, even if it feels risky in the short term, and supporting alternatives that better align with a just and ethical society. This stance can pave the way for meaningful change and a system that respects the principles of those it represents, rather than one that relies on fear to secure votes.",2024_10_31

Have you ever had to [amputate your niece's limbs](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-doctor-amputates-nieces-leg-home-without-anaesthesia-2024-01-19/) with no anaesthesia?

You talk about privilege?? Harris, as the current Vice President, is actively involved in an administration that is actively arming, financing and defending all of these actions. They aren't idle bystanders, they are participants. 

You talk about willingness to compromise? Is it a reasonable or rationale action to suggest someone should be willing to compromise on supporting the genocide and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and the killing of tens of thousands of children, so that people in the US have a slightly better heathcare system or paid maternity leave? Is that honestly what your are suggesting? And you want to talk about privilege....",2024_10_31
"Yes Harris has said she wants a ceasefire. That's honestly empty rhetoric. As the current VP and the presumptive next President, she could advocate for how she will enforce a ceasefire. Because clearly that would need to happen under pressure. There is absolutely nothing that indicates that a President Harris will do anything to enforce a ceasefire. Since her calls for a ceasefire she has effectively supported Israel's expanding the war in Lebanon and she has supported Israel's escalations with Iran. So it really is empty talk. The same applies to her saying she wants a two state solution. It's not just empty rhetoric it's much worse than that because her administration has actively armed and supported the government that has openly said it's against a two state solution and it's actions are designed to ensure there can never be a two state solution. Saying you want something but then doing everything that supports the opposite is, in some respects actually worse than just coming out and saying you support Israel's intent to annex and settle Gaza. Because it's duplicitous. And it prevents an honest debate. Saying you care about Palestinian lives counts for nothing if you are arming and supporting the people that are destroying Palestinians lives.

And when it comes to harm reduction, my argument is that real harm reduction isn’t always achieved by choosing between two negative options. When a system continually forces people to pick the “lesser evil,” it signals that accountability and ethical leadership are secondary to maintaining power. By refusing to validate harmful candidates, you’re demanding higher standards and creating pressure for the system to offer real, positive choices that don’t rely on exploiting fear.

Choosing a principled stance doesn’t mean ignoring the risks, but rather acknowledging that breaking the cycle of fear-based voting is essential for long-term harm reduction. If we want real harm reduction, we need to shift the political landscape toward leaders who actually act - and we promote accountability and integrity over expedience. My argument is that Democrats embracing of expediency in this two party system over many decades has played a large role in creating an environment that has ultimately opened the door to candidates like Trump. That needs to end.",2024_10_31
"I respectfully disagree that it's people's responsibility in a democracy to chose the lesser of two evils. I'm arguing that's it's this very thing that has opened the door to candidates like Trump. We have seemingly bought into the idea of political expediency where values of accountability and ethics are pushed to the side. It's in this environment that people like Trump thrive. 

 Responsibility in a democracy goes beyond simply choosing the least harmful candidate. Real responsibility involves standing for values, demanding accountability, and pushing the system toward genuine representation. Voting solely out of fear of the “greater evil” may seem practical, but it can also perpetuate a cycle of harmful choices and lower the bar for what’s acceptable in leadership. And that's what has happened. In 2016, the Democratic Party rigged the system to push forward Hillary Clinton, who is the very embodiment of expedient Washington politics. That opened the door to the first Trump Presidency. The same is happening now with Harris, who was seen as a terrible candidate in 2019, where she didn't even finish in the top 10. But now Democrat power players decided she would be the candidate - excluding any democratic process. It's become a race to the bottom. The question is, should we be participating in that race to the bottom because of fear?

Real harm reduction isn’t always achieved by choosing between two negative options. When a system continually forces people to pick the “lesser evil,” it signals that accountability and ethical leadership are secondary to maintaining power. The entire ""Vote Blue, No Matter Who"" campaign is designed to entrench political power in the few and unaccountable. By refusing to validate poor or harmful candidates, you’re demanding higher standards and creating pressure for the system to offer real, positive choices that don’t rely on exploiting fear.

The question all Democrat voters need to ask is how to break the cycle of fear-based voting that is essential for long-term harm reduction, especially when it comes to the US Government supporting things like genocide and the mass slaughter of children.

By refusing to vote for candidates that don't represent your values, it can help shift the political landscape toward leaders who actually respect and represent your values ultimately reducing harm by promoting accountability and integrity over expedience.",2024_10_31

trump, meanwhile, is a deranged egotistical narcissistic blowhard, so there's at least an outside chance that netanyahu (who is also a deranged egotistical narcissistic blowhard) will call him stupid or gullible or whatever and trump will simply pull all aid from israel out of petty spite, and he will not care about what it does to the american empire's reputation or soft power whatsoever.

I'm not saying it's ok, because it's not. But there is no justice in this situation. There's been too much history and injustice for both sides since the late 1800s to ever end this in a way that feels fair. Wars are not settled through fairness, they're settled by projecting power. The Palestinians use birth rates and terrorism, the Israels use the most modern military in the world and loose RoEs.

Israel has built one of the most modern, innovative, and globalized economies in the world. US economic integration with Israel is a not small part of how we stay ahead ourselves economically and militarily. We receive more new military tech from Israel than people realize.

At the same time the global Jewish population has still not returned to pre-Holocaust levels (it's expected to in the 2050s). Meanwhile fascism and anti-Semitism are on the rise. The US will always ensure there is a Jewish homeland and thus Israel's right to exist.

For these reasons and more it's fantasy to believe that the US and Israel will ever decouple.

The Israelis will always be allowed to do what they need to to end Palestinian terrorism, even when they do it the wrong way.

If Harris loses MN with it's governor on her ticket then the whole election will likely be an electoral landslide for Trump given it is usually in competition with Illinois for the most left wing state in the midwest. Whatever would cause voters there to reject her so greatly especially with Walz on the ticket is likely not to be isolated to Minnesota. If the problem was just isolated to Minnesota it'd make her job a lot harder since she'd need more states to replace it, but if Minnesota falls her election effort in all likelihood is done for.",2024_10_31

Biden beat Trump in 2020 by 233,012 votes (with nearly 80% voter turnout!) The uncommitted vote in the March primary was just under 46,000. Many/most of those will be voting for Harris/Walz.

Of course there is no one you can vote for directly that represents you right now. But that is why practicality is important. You have to think about which candidate, would lead to a greater likelihood of eventually budging. I.e. since you cannot achieve the result with the election on the surface, which candidate is more likely to potentially do the thing when there are enough calls for it. 

As in, under whose presidency could protests against the war be more successful? Which party is more likely to change in the desired direction? Which one can be held accountable after being elected.

It is not about the lesser evil exclusively there. It is about finding the way your vote has the most impact towards your desired goal. That is the democratic responsibility.",2024_10_31
"idg people acting like Kamala and dems are so much better on this. Biden is in the white house. An arms embargo is popular among voters of both parties, even more so among the progressive wing of “the left”. Instead of making any change in policy to capture votes, it’s been a year of finger wagging “well we told Israel not to do that”, then sending more weapons and money and even having our troops help in committing some of the atrocities. They are more interested in continuing a genocide than winning, judging by their own actions.

People seem fine with moving to the right to capture voters and endorsements from republican leaders who have been chipping away at our rights for decades, but not with pressuring their dem leaders to move left and **stop a fucking genocide**. And then have the audacity to say “one issue voters” have a superiority complex. I’ll wear it. I AM better than them. Opposing genocide should be a hard line and anyone not willing to make themselves uncomfortable to do so or assume some risk trying to stop it does not value human life equally, point blank. 

Palestine is more than one issue. It encompasses all the issues the far left care about (reproductive rights, racism, climate change, anti-colonialism and imperialism, etc.), and we’ve seen ending the genocide, and addressing those problems tied to it, is not a priority for the leadership in this country. We’ve seen what peacefully organizing and protesting against a genocide looks like under a democratic administration and where it’s gotten us (nowhere)(property crime is not violence). What other non-violent option have they given us than the threat of withholding power from them? Kamala literally equated saving Palestinian lives to lessening the cost groceries, and I’m supposed to believe it will be easier to organize under her after she gets elected????? 🥴🤡

If Trump wins the election and all the democrats worst fears come true about the changes he’ll implement, I expect them to side with fascists or bury their head in the sand before standing toe to toe with them to defend marginalized and oppressed communities here, their comments prove they have no real principles or the conviction to stand behind them. They sound like selfish cowards tbh.

"You just proved my point. It's actually funny to me that you have never experienced any suffering within your own country, have no lived experience with it but basically are telling people they support genocide if they vote for Harris (instead of actually realizing there are also real issues at stake for real people here in the US - not just the real tragedies for real people in Gaza). Thanks for referring me to news articles of things you have never experienced. Clearly I was on the money based on your response. Where is your outrage over the persecution over the Uyghurs' in China, war crimes against the Ukrainians, the condition of migrant detainees in the US? I could list more social injustices that I don't see you advocating for as a moral purist. As a nurse- I have seen many traumas, and unlike you I don't consider one human suffering over another, nor am I selective where I empathize. ""A slightly better health care system"" - WOW ultimate privilege and ignorance. Better paid maternity leave? LOL try any for some of us. Also - 17  children were murdered at my high school because of our inability to solve gun violence, so there's that. If you step outside your little bubble - you might be able to see the forest beyond the trees. But that requires self reflection and having life experience. Also - you can hold the pain of the Palestinian people and Jewish people - acknowledge the horrible situation, while still voting for the candidate that will better issues in your own country and have MUCH BETTER chance of aiding in bettering issues in the Middle East - instead of no chance at all. 

You are clearly someone who wants to portray themself as a ""social justice warrior"" when you have absolutely no idea what that means. You are simply a morally outraged poser who reads news articles and takes up the latest social media cause they have limited understanding of - all while shitting on people suffering in their own country because obviously if your house isn't getting blown up by a missile - then you have no right to complain. Also shows your VERY limited understanding of the issues right around you and total lack of empathy. 

Enjoy casting your protest vote or not voting at all. I am sure it will bring about monumental change in the future. Seems to be about the only ""contribution"" you are making to bettering society - or at least you can tell yourself that.

*edit to clarify for those who chose not to read my statement in full - that I do in fact think the Palestinians are real people suffering a great tragedy; while acknowledging there are real people in the US in close proximity suffering great tragedies too. And we are all not in a contest to label who is suffering more or who we should care more about. One doesn't have diminish one person's suffering to acknowledge another's.",2024_10_31

"I mentioned above the reasons why we will only push that button so much and shouldn't expect any US President to do it now. Our military aid to Israel is already mostly a domestic jobs program and this capacity will be built up domestically in Israel over the next 5-10 years.

The Israelis have every reason to prove to the world that the US denying them weapons is not an effective way of changing their behavior. They will do anything to accomplish this because they need to define a new narrative for themselves without us and show they are just as strong going solo while the US arms industry reports layoffs.

We of course should expect them to rapidly accelerate building out gaps in their domestic arms manufacturing capabilities.

But more immediately, one change we should expect from this is more aggressive Israeli bombing in Lebanon and Iran to prevent missile launches, as we deliver quite a bit of their precision missile self-defense munitions. The Israelis also produce most of their own unguided muntions, so forcing them to ration their domestic precision weapons will result in *more* civilian deaths in Gaza than we're seeing now.

In fact, knowing the Israelis, I believe we should expect them to intentionally turn up the slaughter by immediately ceasing use of precision weapons and moving to unguided in Gaza just to embarrass the US.

But let's assume that we cut them off anyway and they do the above. What do you think can be done to get the Israelis and Palestinians both on a path to peace when neither want to?

The threat of losing that will end the war. It would end the colonization. No state is so arrogant and idiotic that they’d risk all of that.

Let's try something - let's ask AI what it says about voting for the lesser of two evils:

................

**Explain this: Voting for the 'lesser of two evils' always shifts the dial towards evil.**  

The phrase ""voting for the 'lesser of two evils' always shifts the dial towards evil"" suggests that when people consistently choose a candidate or option they perceive as less harmful rather than one they genuinely support, it can lead to a normalization of undesirable choices in politics. Here’s a breakdown of this idea:  
1. Choice Limitation: When voters settle for the lesser evil, they reinforce a system where only two main candidates or options are viable. This can discourage new candidates or ideas from emerging.   
2. Moral Compromise: By voting for someone who is not fully aligned with their values, voters may feel they are compromising their principles. This can lead to disillusionment and apathy towards the political process.  
3. Encouraging Negative Traits: If candidates realize that they only need to be ""less evil"" to win votes, they may focus on appealing to base instincts rather than promoting positive change. This can perpetuate a cycle of negative campaigning and governance.  
4. Long-Term Impact: Over time, consistently opting for the lesser evil can create a political environment where harmful practices become more accepted or expected, making it harder to advocate for better alternatives.  

In essence, the argument suggests that while voting for the lesser of two evils might seem pragmatic in the short term, it can have detrimental effects on the political landscape and on society's values in the long run.

**Is it true?**  

Whether the statement is true can depend on individual perspectives and experiences with political systems. Here are some points to consider:  
1. Political System Dynamics: In many electoral systems, especially those dominated by two major parties, voting for the lesser evil can lead to a lack of diversity in political representation. This can reinforce the status quo and limit the emergence of new ideas or candidates.   
2. Voter Disillusionment: Many voters report feeling disillusioned when their choices do not align with their values. This discontent can lead to decreased voter turnout, which may further entrench undesirable candidates or policies in power.   
3. Historical Examples: There are historical instances where voting for the lesser evil has led to negative outcomes, such as the perpetuation of harmful policies or practices. However, there are also cases where such votes have prevented worse outcomes.   
4. Individual Responsibility: Some argue that voters have a responsibility to actively seek and support candidates who represent their values, rather than settling for the lesser evil. This perspective emphasizes the importance of grassroots movements and third-party candidates.   

Ultimately, whether it is ""true"" that voting for the lesser of two evils shifts the dial towards evil is subjective and can vary based on individual beliefs, experiences, and the specific political context.

...............

So - in summary it's about 'individual beliefs, experiences, and the specific political context.'  And neither of us can control that can we?  However - Harris can swing the dial but seems unwilling to do so.",2024_10_31

"From Sen. Bernie Sanders, U.S. senator from Vermont:

I understand that there are millions of Americans who disagree with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on the terrible war in Gaza. I am one of them. 

While Israel had a right to defend itself against the horrific Hamas terrorist attack of Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 innocent people and took 250 hostages, it did not have the right to wage an all-out war against the entire Palestinian people.

It did not have the right to kill 42,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of whom were children, women and the elderly, or injure over 100,000 people in Gaza. It did not have the right to destroy Gaza’s infrastructure and housing and health care systems. It did not have the right to bomb every one of Gaza’s 12 universities. It did not have the right to block humanitarian aid, causing massive malnutrition in children and, in fact, starvation.

That is why I am doing everything I can to block U.S. military aid and offensive weapons sales to Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing extremist government in Israel. I know that many voters share those feelings. And some of you are saying, “How can I vote for Kamala Harris if she is supporting this terrible war?” That is a very fair question.

Let me give you my best answer. And that is that even on this issue, Donald Trump and his right-wing friends are worse. In the Senate and in Congress, the Republicans have worked overtime to block humanitarian aid to the starving children in Gaza. The president and vice president both support getting as much humanitarian aid into Gaza as soon as possible. Trump has said that Netanyahu is “doing a good job” and that Biden is holding him back. He has suggested that the [Gaza Strip would make excellent beachfront property](https://rollcall.com/2024/10/17/why-trumps-vision-of-post-war-gaza-has-gained-little-traction/) for development. It is no wonder Netanyahu prefers to have Donald Trump in office.

She can't voice a separate policy on Israel while she's VP, that just creates confusion in an already tense situation of which the US is the *only* entity that has been able to successfully negotiate a temporary cease fire and so far the only one that's been heavily pushing for a permanence cease fire.

The latter hopes for Trump to give him permission to escalate, thus sabotaging efforts to bring peace to affect the election. Meanwhile, Biden and Harris are actually putting pressure on Netanyahu to limit the damage he can cause by escalating the situation further.

I know who I'd want to handle this situation, and it clearly is the person who believably stands for peace while acknowledging how difficult it is to achieve, and not the jackass who claims peace will be easy, wars will cease immediately, with his toolkit being approved mass slaughter not just in Gaza but also Ukraine.",2024_10_31

- Harris with Biden tried to negotiate a ceasefire to save Palestinian civilians. Trump spoke with Bibi to undermine said deal.

- Harris has listened and directly responded to Palestinian protester demands. Trump has not.

Make no mistake — because of the Spoiler Effect and FPTP Voting in our election system — **Voting 3rd party, or not voting is still a +1 for Trump that could've otherwise gone to Harris.**

Finally let me make it very clear because Harris would certainly rather NOT be associated with being implicated in any sort of genocide, obviously, but: Her hands are tied. Why? Because Jewish voters in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania represent a massive voting bloc that she needs to court. It is why Musk's SuperPAC are funding attack ads targeted at Jewish and Muslim communities saying the exact *opposite* thing about Harris, simultaneously.

So Harris must toe the line between the uncommitted voters in Michigan, and those sympathetic to Israel in PA all the same.

Hopefully Harris wins and decides to hold Israel accountable, but I don’t fault people for not wanting to vote for someone which is enabling Israel. Biden and Harris made this decision to support genocide not the voters, Americans overwhelmingly support a ceasefire and even view themselves as anti war (despite the actual policy implemented).

Therein lies the dilemma. I would not want to be in charge of having to balance that.

"Support for a genocide is a horribly self-defeating single issue?

The Democratic party SHOULD be listening to many conflicting voices, but are they?  It sounds to me like the Democratic party is listening to one voice on this matter... the Israeli lobby.

No one has said the US should entirely stop supporting Israel... many people would settle for the US putting conditions on aid going to Israel.  And not the lip service they're paying with ""you have 30 days to provide aid to Northern Gaza, a region that hasn't received any aid in weeks, or else"".

Or else what?

30 days...plus a few weeks... am I crazy or is that an exceptionally long time for people to not have food or clean potable water... while having bombs dropped on their heads on a daily basis?  Eh... must just be me...

I'm sure many of us saw the recent video of the strike on the Palestinian kid, and then when people (including kids) ran to him to help, the second bomb dropping on those trying to assist?  The US provided that bomb!

But but but... all those conflicting voices the Democrats have to listen to! /s

My favorite is that ""Harris is just waiting to win the presidency before she can change course on policy"".  This after she's stated pretty clearly that she has no intention of changing policy.  Biden could change policy today.  Also, the idea that the Democratic Establishment and Biden personally selected Harris, there was no vote, without confirming she'd hold course on this policy is ... frankly... mind boggling.  ""We won't give you assurances, but trust us, the party that's sent $18 billion in military aid to Israel this year"".

Everyone reading this... do yourself a favor and watch a White House press briefing sometime.  Mainstream media is an awful (biased) source of information regarding this ongoing situation, who often fails to give watchers the full story.  At the press briefings, just about every journalist in the room is frustratedly asking questions about Israel/Gaza on a daily basis for most of the allotted time.

Having a higher kill count is expected when the ones attacking don't invest in parity levels of education, training, organization, culture, or equipment. Just because your enemy is stupid enough to attack doesn't mean you have to meet them halfway and be stupid enough to let them do so unimpeded. They're trying to kill you, so you stop them.

Um, the PA and Hamas were expressly already doing that? UNRWA school teachers and classroom material are blatantly antisemitic and glorify violence against Israelis. The PA pays out hundreds of millions of dollars a year to incentivize violence (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority_Martyrs_Fund), a program that receives extremely high popular support.

Pretending this isn't a culture already singularly focused on violence is so disingenuous. The generation that perpetrated October 7 is the same generation indoctrinating Palestinian children to pursue future violence at the expense of future peace. Unfortunately, there are real-world consequences when violent matrydom becomes the predominant social and political force in a society.

I'd rather Palestinian children have as equal a chance at educational and financial opportunity as any Israeli child, but their terrorist government and social institutions make that an impossibility, one that Israel can't tolerate for the sake of its own security. Palestinian children are innocent, but there's no way to permanently eradicate Hamas without civilians getting caught in the crossfire, because Hamas makes it their mission to put civilians in the crossfire. 

Unfortunately, that will cause anger and resentment towards the Israeli government, but it's unavoidable without playing into Hamas's terroristic attempts at manipulation. Israel is essentially betting that destroying Hamas at all costs in order to rehabilitate Gaza afterwards will have a higher chance of ensuring long term peace than letting them fester.

"""Not being enlisted"" is not the same as ""not currently fighting."" Soldiers at a mess hall are a fair target during war. Soldiers that have been discharged, especially ones that have finished mandatory service and left the military, are not.

Does Hamas's military have a formal discharge process? Is there a strict legal and organizational separation of civilian and military responsibilities?Are their rules of engagement (lol) in accordance with international law?

Hamas is a bunch of insurgents that snatched power 20 years ago and have been controlling Gaza ever since. They don't operate on any legal or moral foundation, and they don't even take steps to protect their own civilians. In fact, they do the exact opposite.

"Trump/GOP/MAGA2025/Fascist will 'deport' anyone they deem undesirable.

Are they going to give them armbands, load them on trains, transport them to camps?",2024_10_31
Watch as he still wins Florida. Shameful.,2024_10_31
Mar-a-Lago and Trump’s golf courses employed undocumented workers for years.,2024_10_31
Scummy lads wouldn't do mass deportation fairly. It'd be targeted at liberal communities.,2024_10_31
"It's time to engage in a thought experiment. Lets simply envision what mass deportations will look like in Authoritarian America using the model of how this has happened throughout history.

On January 21st, 2025, following Trumps coronation as the 47th US President, he signs into law an executive order granting him emergency powers to overcome the dangerous illegal migrant population in the U.S. Using that and other already existing laws, Trump commands the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) to deputize all local police forces nationwide as immigration officers. The people cheer, because they've been told for years now how unsafe the country is now thanks to these people.

Unfortunately for them, Illegal immigrants are hard to find. They do not regularly interact with our government and it's not like they all wear matching t-shirts. So what do you do? You go house to house. You check. 

Now they probably won't enter your home at that time (if the 4th amendment still exists) so maybe people will be able to hide at their legal friends houses. To combat this, the government sets up a tip line encouraging all patriots to report these activities and those they suspect as being illegal migrants to the police. Now the government has the authority to enter the home of those harboring fugitives, and take those that hid them into custody as well. 

You might be saying, ""that will get so many people!"" And your right, it is. It'll overload the system. So while they await trial, the illegal immigrants are imprisoned. Don't worry though, if the prisons fill up too quick, I'm sure one of our billionaire patriots (in exchange for a lucrative government contract) will gladly fund the construction of new ""open air prisons"" at the border to house the migrants indefinitely until they can be processed. 

Half the country is in an uproar (as they should be) and begin marching in protest to the government actions. President Trump, untethered by anyone who can tell him no, follows through with his threats from the summer of 2020 and allows police to begin shoot protesters. The riots stop, and the mistreatment of migrants continues.

The time is now October 2025 and you realize the America you remember is gone. You can't speak out against it. What do you do now?

Suddenly, there is a knock at the door. A report has been made about you by one of your neighbors. You do have non white heritage after all, its not like they can tell just by looking at you if you are ""American"" or not. (better safe than sorry right?)

So you pull out your ID, you're birth certificate, and any other proof you have that you are and have always been an American. Unfortunately, the Trump administration had recently outlawed birthright citizenship, and your mother had been born in America after her mother fled somewhere else. She wasn't a legal citizen at the time. You citizenship in this country is now denied. They march you to a waiting vehicle and your new life begins. 

Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it'll all go great. 

Maybe not.",2024_10_31

He can deport more than usual, maybe have more draconian border policies and claim victory.

Any road blocks and he can throw up his hands and blame everyone. Likely he will say it's great and then 2 years later say it is bad again just like the dreaded caravans. 

The bigger issue are the true believers he is surrounding himself and are the real policy and decision makers. They actually do want to get rid of them and many think it will be easier than it is. They will push to deport, then quickly move to camps because you physically cannot deport so many people since it requires the other countries to accept them back and would cost an insane amount of money.

Edit - I just want to be clear how comically terrible and bad of a plan this is that isn't possible to work. He's obviously just throwing out words he thinks sound cruel because even if he was competent, and he is not, this wouldn't really be possible at anywhere near the levels he's seems to be claiming.

4 years is 1044 working days. You would need almost 960 deportations every single working day, including holidays so closer to 1000 per day taking people on a bus on a plane on a boat for 4 straight years. Bruh Trump would be lucky to get to 100 a day 2 years into his term. The kind of police force required to do this isn't materializing in 6 months and still wouldn't be good enough 2 years in. Remember also he would get bogged down in the courts. One celebrity activist placed in the right place at the right time could easily slow the whole system down and at the point of snatching up 1000 humans every single day they will make that mistake there's no way to manage that accurately without so much more infrastructure. This is just one state. He wants 50 operations of a similar size? 50,000 people every single day being removed from America? An entire stadium filled to capacity every single day for 4 years will be successfully removed from the country during a trump term? No. He will pass more tax cuts for his friends and chicken out. But even if he tries to do this, it's an impossible political promise. Trump is a liar. Trump is an idiot. A cruel, racist, idiot, just like his supporters. Who are just as stupid for thinking a plan like this could work in any context for which it's proposed. Their legislative plan is hate. Their goals are unobtainable. They have lost the plot.

Trump has already been asked about that in an interview and doesn’t think that accidentally deporting people is that big a deal.  

He’s also talked about revoking legal status for groups of immigrants in the country so that he can deport them. 

When given the opportunity to ramp up the staffing of immigration courts so that they could process cases more expediently to get through backlogged cases and begin removals, Trump had his allies in Congress block it.

A relatively small % were shipped to Japan after the war, and those did not come back. But generally they were interned in camps in the US, so there was no “coming back” beyond them finding a place to go. 

Over 50,000 legal immigrants and over 70,000 native-born citizens (native-born because Japanese immigrants could not become citizens until 1952) were released from internment with no homes to go back to. So they didn’t so much “come back” as they found somewhere to go (often back to same region as before, yes).

"I know that.  But Trump ""driving"" the garbage-truck more strongly calls to mind the concept of ""I'm here to dispose of the trash"", which is in line with HIM describing America as ""the world's garbage can"", and frequently describing people and entire demographic groups that he doesn't like as trash.  His message has loudly been that America = garbage = bad, and he's going to ""fix"" it.

So it just creates a mixed message.  He's there to clean up the trash.  But he's surrounded by supporters dressed as trash.

It's dumb to tout yourself as the guy who will clean up the garbage, at the same time as your supporters are trying to claim the label ""garbage"" as some point of pride.

The first ""his"" is referring to Trump - ""Trump's supporter"" - Tony Hinchcliffe.

The so-called “Purcell principle” is intended to stop federal courts from getting dragged into last-minute election controversies.

"...then no one gets to vote, burn down the system ",2024_10_31
"That’s not what happens. To get a license and registration, you have to have several forms of identification. I’m in Texas. I just had to renew mine for the new TSA laws. I am a citizen, I was still required to bring passport, or SS card and birth certificate. In some states there is a checkbox at the top which is easy to miss. But that’s beside the point, it wasn’t that these people were non citizens; it was that they made an error and were not given the time to correct it, and the Supreme Court just broke the law by saying that Virginia can dump voters daily. It’s absolutely absurd and completely implicates the Supreme Court in this scheme to overthrow the government and our votes",2024_10_31
"Clearly you are not interested in the truth, which is citizens were purged illegally after the deadline. ""In their emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Virginia election officials relied in part on a still-developing legal theory that warns federal courts against making last-minute changes to the status quo of voting rules before an election. The so-called “Purcell principle” is intended to stop federal courts from getting dragged into last-minute election controversies.

Virginia argued that the federal district court violated that principle by pausing the program. Voting rights groups countered that there was a federal law in play in this instance that specifically allowed plaintiffs to challenge last-minute voting changes.

Lawyers for Virginia also pointed to its option for same-day registration. Those whose registrations were wrongly cancelled could re-register at an in-person polling place by affirming their citizenship.

Virginia’s opponents countered that that option would not solve the issue for purged voters who planned to vote absentee, unaware their registrations had been cancelled and that it risked confusion at polling places – particularly if poll workers weren’t adequately prepared to deal with the scenario.""   SO ONCE AGAIN THEY WERE NOT NOTIFIED WITH ENOUGH TIME TO CAST ABSENTEE BALLOTS WHICH COUNTERS THE ARGUMENT THAT THEY COULD REGISTER SAME DAY. The supreme court gave NO REASON FOR ALLOWING IT TO CONTINUE. NONE WHATSOEVER. The list that they pulled was not verified -- they systematically removed voters based on a faulty and controversial technology and 5 times were told to put the voters back. The cheaters when to the corrupt supreme court. You clearly cannot read. And have no interest in the truth. But I tell you what if it was democrats doing this, you'd be crying in your bottle.

I am talking about what happened in my state where I specifically told that I was a non-citizen to a government employee yet was still asked about if I wanted to register to vote.,2024_10_31
">At the heart of the case is whether Virginia’s voter removal process violates a so-called quiet period under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), or a federal law requiring states to halt all **""systematic""** voter roll maintenance for a 90-day period before a federal election.

>That argument pitted the Department of Justice — which sued the state over its removal program earlier this month — against Youngkin, who insisted the state's process is **""individualized""** and conducted in accordance with state and federal law. 

>In the state’s petition to the Supreme Court, Virginia Attorney General Jason S. Miyares objected to the lawsuit and subsequent court ruling on several grounds. First, he argued the NVRA does not extend to ""self-identified noncitizens"" in the state – adopting a more narrow reading of the law than the Justice Department and one that he said could render the primary basis for the lawsuit obsolete. 

>Second, he argued that if the NVRA does apply, the state still has an ""individualized process"" of removing voters that is conducted by the Department of Motor Vehicles and directly by local registration offices.",2024_10_31
"Did you try to register? I’m betting you didn’t because it never happens. When I mean never, I mean like once in twenty years. This situation was because they used technology that lined up some random checkmark instead of verifying credentials. That’s what the whole case is about. I posted several links above. I suggest you actually read one of them because there are far too many checks in place for them to get away with this lie. In Texas, the most rampant fascist govt, they knocked off my mother, who has voted here for 40 years, because she recently changed addresses. That’s is illegal. They don’t give AF. They see if it’s Democrat or if the name sounds foreign and deregister you. The good thing is they did it before 90  days and notified the people they removed. In this case, those criminals in VA didn’t verify the data, they are purging them daily, they didn’t notify voters.",2024_10_31

>An angry tattooed bearded white man began screaming at the Bello and Coniaris while driving by. Bello started recording as the man stepped out of his vehicle, wearing a dark-colored cap, t-shirt, and jogging pants. The man accused the two canvassers of placing Harris campaign signs “all over public property.” The canvassers explained that they weren’t doing that.

>“F\*\*king c\*\*ksucking f\*\*\*ots!” the man yelled. “Get your little f\*\*king f\*\* a\*\*es out of this town. We don’t need you in this f\*\*king town. You little f\*\*king pieces of sh\*\*. Go suck each other’s c\*\*ks somewhere else, you f\*\*king f\*\*\[s\], before I f\*\*king put a gun in you pieces of s\*\*t. I will be back and rip every one of your f\*\*ing signs out of your…”

>The man then re-entered his vehicle and sped off while continuing to yell obscenities. Bello told Coniaris to step off of the road as the man’s vehicle sped away.

> “It was obviously terrifying at the time,” Bello told the aforementioned publication. “Our goal was just to de-escalate and try and get him to leave as fast as possible.”

>“It made me think of how one-sided the hatred is,” he continued. “A Trump supporter might feel uncomfortable in a highly Democratic area, but I don’t feel like a lot of Trump supporters would feel physically unsafe and threatened in the way that this guy made us feel.”

>Bello added that he hopes his experience will encourage other LGBTQ+ voters to help Harris win the election.

> “As intense as it was, this is what generations of queer people before us have endured, and it’s our turn to be there and face the hatred. The hate is real,” he told Advocate.com. “Don’t let it scare you. The only way we can fight this hate is to not back down.”

"No, it was designed to avoid a standing army.

During the constitutional convention, the founders *really* didn't want to have an army of enlisted soldiers, and got the 2nd amendment passed to formalize a ""common defense"" (against hostile foreign sources), composed of a heavily armed militia.

They saw how well that worked, literally within the year.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Clair's_defeat

It failed so hard, we got a standing army out of it. Passed by the same congress that passed by the 2nd amendment, and who were opposed to the idea of a standing army.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_the_United_States

The idea of using a militia for defense lasted less than a year. 

It was never intended to defend against a tyrannical federal government. That's revisionist history, mostly because that same congress engaged in the most followed tradition in politics. They said ""we'll deal with the problem later"" and kicked the can of reverting the 2nd amendment (which lost it's core purpose with the establishment of a permanent Standing Army) down the road to deal with later (and they never dealt with it).

It would be embarrassing to revert one of your big amendments you passed less than a year before. So they didn't.

It was only through a very ""Originalist"" viewing of history, and you stop reading the second the amendment was passed, that you get a heavily armed militia was what was intended.

Interestingly, for that Originalist logic to hold true, you also need to effectively disband the entire US Military (at least the enlisted personnel side of things). You don't see them doing that, do you?",2024_10_31

The additional jobs this would create for people in healthcare who may not want to work in a clinical setting would be a good thing as well.

Sure there are chances it could be abused, much like anything, but there are ways to add a reasonable amount of checks and balances.

"Can you clarify what you mean by that? Part A absolutely covers Home Care and Hospice (source: I bill Medicare for those services specifically for a living). Sounds like the proposal expands the type of coverage provided, but saying it doesn't currently cover care in the home isn't quite true. The non-medical services mentioned are usually covered if ADL support is needed and they qualify for home care (ie, meet definition of homebound). You can't currently just get aide services if there's no skilled need, but the examples given in the article talk about alzheimers patients, who would likely be covered under a skilled need.

Editing to add: I'm a fan of her proposal, I just keep hearing people say Medicare doesn't cover this and have no idea where that sentiment comes from. It certainly needs to be expanded, just don't understand where these media outlets are getting that Medicare doesn't currently cover it.",2024_10_31

A huge amount of the bias of orgs like CNN is how they don't report on things.   Not that big of a chomsky fan, but Manfacturing consent is a fantastic read about this and how no one in the USA knew anything about the situation with indonesia in East timor back in the 70s because the media refused to report on it.  None of this would be shown in this chart.

>Both sides love demonizing each other. Once again, you guys have a lot more in common than you think


""Both sides"" demonize each other but I'm objectively correct lol. The highly educated skews left wing and the non-educated skew hard right.   This is an extremely well known fact and facts don't care about your feelings or ""sides"".

""Both sides"" in the debate about the flat earth demonize each other constantly too.   That doesn't mean ""both sides"" are valid. 

I also demonize tankies all the time.

Theres a lot more than ""Both sides"" out there",2024_10_31
">but created by a ""for-profit business with a stated public mission"", word for word from their site. If you look at the chart itself it very the ""reputable sources"" noticeably shifts to the left.

No shit, bruh. It's their job to evaluate media bias and sell that information to marketers for money. That's what the organization does. Does a profit motive invalidate their work? Nope. I seriously hope you're not the type of person who sees a pipe burst in the kitchen, but refuses to call the plumber because the plumber is a ""for-profit business"", so his work can't be trusted.

And did you actually read up on their methodology or did you just seize upon the first sentence to try and portray them as bumbling goons in an effort to save your argument?  Keep in mind that they have taken tens of millions from angel investors for a reason.

>Each article or show is rated by at least three analysts – one left-leaning, one right-leaning and one center, politically. All of our media analysts complete a training period that includes a thorough introduction to our methodology, as well as practice rating articles and other news content. We purposefully assign each analyst a breadth of coverage over as many sources as possible to enhance each analyst’s familiarity with sources across the spectrum.

>Analysts generally score articles similarly following our analysis training, regardless of their political lean; however, when significant differences occur, the group engages in a conversation during which analysts present their rationale for their respective scores.

>We do not rate the merits of political positions. Rather, we place the content where it descriptively belongs relative to the current range of political thought within the United States. When scoring for reliability, our method focuses on classifying content along a continuum including fact, analysis, opinion, incomplete story, propaganda, and fabricated information.

>All of the above minimizes the impact of analyst bias on reliability and source bias scoring. It results in a rating of sources that many individuals, instructors, and other stakeholders find helpful in navigating today’s news ecosystem.

Lastly, I didn't ask you to justify your demonization to me. Just acknowledge that that is what you're doing.",2024_10_31

I usually fix shit like that myself because basic maintenance is easy, youtube is a phenomenal teacher, and I enjoy it.  But no, there's no one in the entire western world who would thinks every plumber can't be trusted because it's a for profit business.  But the opposite, trusting literally every plumber and auto mechanic out there is pretty darn naive, don't you think?  

What I'm doing is actually analyzing your source.   I went to the site to actually read their methodology speficially because I remembered it  *had jacobin to the right of msnbc* a few years ago, which is patently absurd.  I will give them credit that that's no longer the case, but still.  That's rediculous.


I then wrote out a simplification of exactly what their method is and then pointed out some very specific, obvious flaws that would be biases that wouldn't be picked up by their system.  The org wouldn't put that in their own self marketing materials for very obvious reasons!  



>We do not rate the merits of political positions. Rather, we place the content where it descriptively belongs relative to the current range of political thought within the United States.

This is also pretty much exactly what I wrote about the Overton window in the usa.  I originally wrote how right leaning CNN vs the rest of developed world - again, on everything that isn't LGBT.

And to cope and keep them interested, they've convinced them that holding their worthless stock is a virtuous stand against the very people using their stupidity for easy gains.

And I just could help but laugh given my discussion just the day before.


Second: my late grandfather in law.  Again very fox newsy - lock her up bumper sticker etc.   but the amusing thing was how his views changed depending on whether he was primed by Fox News on a particular topic or not.   If he was primed: “of course the billionaires deserve to keep all their money” if we wasn’t: “omg the rich people are destroying my old neighborhood.”  So basically depending on whether he saw it on Fox News or saw it in real life his views would swing from extreme right to extreme left.",2024_10_31

The other part of me thinks they dont want maga to see harris winning at the polls and resort to violence to try to “”fix things””. Harris and Trump “are effectively tied” in a lot of polls nationwide and maga is already setting fire to ballot boxes and swinging machetes at voters. Imagine how further deranged if they knew they were losing hard.

Instead these polls got them right where dems were in 2016; complacent in things as they unwittingly march to defeat, in what they thought would be a slam dunk of a win

And the betting markets are just being manipulated as hell. The same people that have been grifting from maga for years with “build the wall”, all manners of bitcoin and dogcoin investments, nft cards etc… its just another day in the life of maga dropping all their savings on another scheme to completely drain them of all their money….

The trick then is to make the discovery of new evidence something of a trickle. Actual experts or professionals are declared as part of the conspiracy, lines are drawn on who's an ally and who's not, and new never heard of influences emerge like celebrities. 

But it's all text, it's all that energy in the hype and dopamine and it actually becomes really hard to look at the puzzle of new knowledge because when looking too close and never take a step back and realize that the puzzle isn't actually making anything, it's always going to be incomplete.

Not everyone in the military or police did nothing.

"With Gorsuch I genuinely think he does have a moral compass. I think his moral compass is wrong 99% of the time because we have totally different values I just think this is an issue we agree on.

If it is a blue wave, I don't see the Court giving Trump the presidency, but they might make it harder for people to exercise the right to vote in the future.  However, if Republicans win Senate, keep the house and it's a close election for president, then all bets are off and they will rule in favor of Trump.  But they won't sit by and let him dismantle the court.",2024_10_31

"Yeah, the main difference between us is that you have 100% certainty in what Trump and his followers will or will not try or do. I do not have that certainty.

I get the sense that if I had said prior to Jan 6 that Trump would whip up thousands of followers and they would storm the capitol, delay the certification, injure over 100 cops, and chant 'Hang Mike Pence!', you would have called me hysterical. If that wasn't on your bingo card, you really don't have any right to claim what will or won't happen with such ironclad certainty.",2024_10_31
How do you determine which years they were manipulated?,2024_10_31
"Possibly, yes.",2024_10_31
"No, it's simply irrelevant. 

The start, we don't know their exact method for setting the lines. They clearly have a model that works. 

We can be sure that it's a combination of different information and news events can move the odds.  We also know that lines can be adjusted based on the action on each side. 

How they set the odds is irrelevant to the point that historically, their odds have been accurate.

> A recent analysis by The New York Times noted that Trump&#039;s rally speeches over the past eight years have become darker, longer, more profane and increasingly unfocused and unhinged - a troubling sign that he is no longer able to articulate ideas or reason in ways we expect of our leaders.

> Once a &quot;Never Trump&quot; conservative who openly criticized Trump as a danger to the republic, Vance has since fully embraced an extremist ideology, morphing into a vocal MAGA supporter who seems eager to emulate Trump&#039;s worst instincts.

> Donald Trump has never had the moral compass to lead this country.

If the powers to be in the Repub party did what the Dems did and gave Trump the nomination without primaries, I am sure you would add that to your ""evidence"" that Trump is a ""threat to democracy"", no?",2024_10_31
no because he does not have dementia,2024_10_31
Ask him to draw a clock,2024_10_31
"No, political parties are free to nominate candidates using whatever rules they want. In fact if you check, you'll find that the Republican party has changed the rules a few times to benefit Trump. Just as the Dems changed rules regarding superdelegates after the heated contest between Hillary and Bernie.

The evidence that Trump is a threat to democracy is that he refused to accept the results of a democratic election and attempted to overturn it. I'll recap it for you in case you need the history refreshed:

* He called up election officials in states he lost demanding they ""find"" enough votes to make him the winner.

* He signed off on a fake elector scheme to send ""alternate"" slates of electors claiming he won states he, in fact, lost.

* He pressured his VP to go along with the fake elector scheme, and to refuse to certify the actual winner of the election.

* He pressured the DoJ to issue a statement that the election was rigged and ""leave the rest"" to him and Republicans in Congress.

* When all of these plans failed, he then sent a frenzied mob of his supporters to the Capitol to disrupt the certification process.

Do you believe this is insufficient evidence that he is a threat to democracy?",2024_10_31
What about a simple shape: a square. I’ll bet he ends up drawing an arc and then telling us he’s way above squares and that Puerto Rico loves him.,2024_10_31
"It is debatable if the ""fake elector"" ""scheme"" was legal or not.  He did not send a mob to to disrupt.  He told them to peacefully protest.  Other than that he did what he could do legally to challenge what he thought was an illegitimate outcome.  Al Gore 2.0. He failed, and become ex President.

  
So no, he was not a threat. If he wins, would you like to make a little wager that he will not go beyond his term?",2024_10_31
"Fuck man, you may have a bead on his broken ass mind. I wonder if when that happens, when Trump says “Fuck these people” and they say “well fuck you too, buddy!”, then he has to tell everyone “these people love me”, are “these people” his dad?

"Here's Trump 4 years ago:

(If you'd rather listen:  https://youtu.be/ec9P3C1OXqE)

""We'll have…a…an economy based on wind. I never understood wind. And I know windmills, very much, I've studied it better than anybody. I know, it's very expensive. They're made in China and Germany mostly. Very few made here, almost none. But they're manufactured TREMENDOUS if you're into this TREMENDOUS fumes, gases, are spewing into the atmosphere, you know, we have a world, right?

So, the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You-toppa- you-talk about the carbon footprint. Fumes are spewing into the air right? sp-sp-spewing, whether it's in CHINA, Germany, it's going into the air, it's our air their air everything, right? So they make these things and then they put them up and if you own a house with a vision of some of these monsters, Uh your house is worth 50% of the price, they're noisy, they kill the birds.

You want to see a birve grade yard? You just go, take a look, a bird graveyard. Go under a windmill someday. You'll see more birds than you've ever seen, ever in your life. 

You know, in California, they were killing the bald eagle. If you shoot a bald eagle, they want to put you in jail for 10 years.

A windmill will kill many bald eagles. It's true! And you know what? After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off. That's true, by the way, this is, they make you turn it off after you and yet, if you killed one, They put you in jail, that's okay. But why is it okay for these windmills to destroy the bird population And that's what they're doing. I'll tell you another thing about windmills. And I'm not, look, I like all forms of energy and I think really, they're okay in industrial areas like you have an industrial plant, you put up a windmill, you know, Etc. etc I've seen the most beautiful fields, farms, fields, most gorgeous things you've ever seen and then you have these ugly things going up, and sometimes they're made by different companies, you know, I'm like a perfectionist.

I really built good stuff and so you'll see like a few windmills made by one company General Electric. And then you'll see a few made by Siemens and you'll see a few made by some other guy that doesn't have 10 cents. It looks like. So it looks like. So you see all these windmills?

They're all different shades of color? They're like sort of white but one's like An orange white. It's my favorite color, orange.

And you see these magnificent fields and they're ruined. And you know what, they don't tell you about windmills after 10 years. They look like how, you know, they start to get tired, old. You got to replace them. A lot of times people don't replace them. They need massive subsidy from the government in order to make it. No, we're doing it right, we're doing it right. And you know, our numbers environmentally right now are better than they've ever been before. Just so you know, because I'm an environmentalist, I am. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air anywhere.""",2024_10_31

">Former President Donald Trump should leave the meteorology to the professionals.

>After taking jabs at Kamala Harris and his second debate moderators at a North Carolina rally Wednesday afternoon, Trump suddenly turned to Hurricane Helene, the category storm that devastated large swaths of the state earlier this month, leaving 130 people dead and damaging [key infrastructure](https://www.wftv.com/news/local/hospitals-report-shortage-iv-fluids-after-plant-damaged-by-hurricane-helene/FBVCZ7AQYNCRNNPURNOMWLWDRI/) beyond repair.

>“I must’ve been the first one, I followed that storm right in,” the former president [said](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1851689544577355862). “I saw the devastation, it was a travesty, it was viscous, it was water. The water was the worst we’d ever seen. It was a water hurricane, that’s what it was.”

>This may have been a part of Trump’s usual meandering rally ramblings, or he may just be truly unaware of what a Category 4 hurricane entails. Either way, he spent an ample amount of time explaining how a hurricane works to a crowd that just experienced one of the deadliest hurricanes in two decades.

>After more ranting, Trump then re-upped the [false claim](https://newrepublic.com/post/187110/north-carolina-governor-cooper-trump-hurricane-lie) that the federal disaster response was a complete failure due to Democrats taking money out of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to “give” to immigrants.  

>“They don’t have any money for North Carolina, or a lot of other states, you find out they don’t have any money. FEMA spent money on bringing illegal aliens into our country.”

>This conspiracy has been thoroughly [debunked](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-mar-a-lago/index.html). FEMA has approved $100 million of aid to North Carolina. It did not spend any of its disaster funds on the southern border, and even Republicans have [pushed back](https://edwards.house.gov/media/press-releases/debunking-helene-response-myths) on this claim.

Shorts closing to take profits. It looks like buying activity (it is - you have to buy stocks to return what you borrowed to open the short), and causes this price to rise.

The Economist has more courage than everyone still working at the Washington Post and the LA Times.,2024_10_31
"Here are some highlights from the Economist's endorsement article:

> By making Mr Trump leader of the free world, Americans would be gambling with the economy, the rule of law and international peace. We cannot quantify the chance that something will go badly wrong: nobody can. But we believe voters who minimise it are deluding themselves.

> The case against Mr Trump begins with his policies. In 2016 the Republican platform was still caught between the Mitt Romney party and the Trump party. Today’s version is more extreme. Mr Trump favours a 20% tariff on all imports and has talked of charging over 200% or even 500% on cars from Mexico. He proposes to deport millions of irregular immigrants, many with jobs and American children. He would extend tax cuts even though the budget deficit is at a level usually seen only during war or recession, suggesting a blithe indifference to sound fiscal management.

> The risks for domestic and foreign policy are amplified by the last big difference between Mr Trump’s first term and a possible second one: he would be less constrained. The president who mused about firing missiles at drug labs in Mexico was held back by the people and institutions around him. Since then the Republican Party has organised itself around fealty to Mr Trump. Friendly think-tanks have vetted lists of loyal people to serve in the next administration. The Supreme Court has weakened the checks on presidents by ruling that they cannot be prosecuted for official acts.

> If external constraints are looser, much more will depend on Mr Trump’s character. Given his unrepentant contempt for the constitution after losing the election in 2020, it is hard to be optimistic. Half his former cabinet members have refused to endorse him. The most senior Republican senator describes him as a “despicable human being”. Both his former chief-of-staff and former head of the joint chiefs call him a fascist. If you were interviewing a job applicant, you would not brush off such character references.

The article is a little too *both sides are bad!* for my liking, but hey, if it convinces anyone to not vote for Trump, you won't see me complaining.",2024_10_31

"The moment Supreme Court granted certain immunity to a sitting president in favor of Trump, the POTUS has already become a huge risk to those who have nefarious intents.

"If he wins this time, our great ‘liberal media’ would have had a large part to play in it. Not taking steps to fact check and clarify the misinformation/disinformation is extremely hurtful to the democratic process. Yeah we did it a few times is just not enough. It has to be done consistently. For example, about the economy, inflation has been historically low in the US throughout this last decade, with extreme money printing and low interest rates, simply because the supply side is always controlled. There is always abundant supply of stuff here and thus inflation was low, even though there is always excess money in the system. This is what happened during Trump’s time too. He DID NOT do anything in particular to effect low inflation. Then along came Covid and inflation spiraled due to global supply chain disruptions. The Fed’s denial through second half of 2020 and most of 2021 exacerbated it to a certain extent. And now inflation is close to target albeit with raised prices, which is absolutely hurting household budgets. But Trump DOES NOT have a plan to counter this besides harping on that ONLY lowering energy costs will bring prices down. It is laughable. And I have not heard the ‘so called liberal media’ point this out EVEN ONCE all the while claiming Harris does not give specifics of her plan. It is fucking sad. I fully understand that even if the media gives an objective take on this, it is not going to appeal to most MAGA but at least, to those on the fence, it might and the media has unfortunately forsaken this important role of theirs.",2024_10_31

I keep seeing this and I sincerely doubt this would occur.

SCOTUS has already signaled he can do what he wants.  I think it’s far more likely he appoints one of his kids as his successor and SCOTUS allows it.  What happens after that who knows but I don’t think we’d see Congress suddenly pull the rug out from Trump.,2024_10_31

"Why do the experts cited in this very article not see it that way?  

Section (d) as best I can tell says nothing about lying about what some candidate's policies are.  It's about making false statements to ""examiners or hearing officers"".  It says nothing about falsehoods in political ads.

As to his voter registration site violating (c), that doesn't apply here either, as this does not say anything about gathering voter information and then not registering them.  He is, however, being sued for potentially paying people to register with that lottery thing, but that's a different thing than the voter registration site.  

I don't like these underhanded tactics, or lying to trick people.  But we have to be level headed here or we are committing the act Trump is accusing us of, that is, wanting the government to prosecute them for things that aren't crimes.",2024_10_31

"A teenage Donald Trump supporter is accused of threatening two Kamala Harris supporters, including a 71-year-old, with a 2ft-long machete, police say.

The local Republican chairman suggested the incident came in the wake of “anger” caused by [Joe Biden’s “garbage” comments](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/30/joe-biden-trump-supporters-garbage-puerto-rico/) and allegations of Trump being a fascist by the Democrat.

Caleb James Williams, 18, is charged with felony aggravated assault on a person 65 or older and misdemeanour exhibition of a dangerous weapon, Neptune Beach police records show.

Police Chief Michael Key Jr. said Williams and seven 16- and 17-year-olds drove to a suburban Jacksonville library on Tuesday afternoon specifically “to protest and antagonise the opposing political side”.

Carrying Trump flags, they began yelling at a group of Harris supporters and that escalated.

A photo taken by an alleged witness shows Williams “brandishing a machete in an aggressive, threatening posture over his head,” the police chief said.

The Harris supporters are aged 71 and 54.

“This goes way beyond expressing freedom of speech. To say your piece is your First Amendment protected right, but that goes out the window the moment you raise a machete over your head,” Mr Key said.

Williams, a restaurant busboy, was being held without bond on Wednesday morning at the Duval County Jail pending his initial appearance in court.

The minimum sentence for aggravated assault on a senior in Florida is three years in prison. The maximum is 15.

Key said the seven juveniles with Williams did not appear to have committed any crimes, but the investigation is ongoing.

Someone is acting like domestic terrorists, actually prosecute them for such. Regardless of party.

I'm sure you'll find some left leaning ones, along the significantly larger right leaning ones.

Over the past 10 years, 75% of all deaths from terrorism in the US have been from traditional right wing terrorists.

20% were from Islamic terrorists (because apparently a conservative religious terrorist doesn't qualify as right wing)

4% were left leaning

And 1% were miscellaneous.

So if you arrested 100 domestic terror8sts at random, you'd find 4 liberals, 75 conservatives, 20 Islamists (or 95 conservatives), and 1 odd one out.

No alternate slates of electors will be accepted. The election won’t be thrown to the House of Representatives so he can win. There won’t be any matching on the Capitol.

If enough doubt is made than the vote will go to the House of representatives which will then each get one vote. Currently there is a Republican majority in the House. This means the House of Reps will likely vote for Trump and Mike Johnson will certify it. If for some reason republicans dont all vote for Trump the the riots will commence and they will try and breach the capital to kill Congress again. 

I can tell you this 2 of the three commissioners in my county are already gearing up to deny our election results in our county in Pa (we are a red county). They are doing this so that even if Trump wins our county, Pa will still look like it has voter fraud. Trump is also saying Berks county has election fraud. Hes and the Republican Party (MAGA party) are already laying the ground work to get this election sent to congress. 

This plan works two fold because if he loses it was fraud. If he wins he beat the corruption and he can now put them behind bars.

"I’m guessing if something happened it would be multiple attacks in the states, possibly the swing states that went blue at their capital buildings or other important govt buildings. As stupid as these guys are I don’t think they are quite dumb enough to try to takeover the capital again during the certification of the vote. But if they do I hope they keep the cameras rolling as the assholes receive wave after wave of teargas and rubber bullets. 

If any of these fringe groups are communicating on sites or apps then some govt agency, probably the FBI, will be keeping tabs on what the plan is to some extent before it happens. It would be easier for them to have smaller groups attack multiple places nationwide. I don’t think it will be about being in DC to overthrow the election anymore, I think they are just going to be livid. But maybe if there are certain dates between Election Day and the inauguration when the states individually certify before it goes to DC then those would be the days to look out for imo.",2024_10_31

Instant vitriol. ""It's not creepy!"" ""It's basic manners, women should expect it!"" ""These women knew I'm just looking out for them!"" ""That's how I was raised and I'm not changing it because this new generation are a bunch of heathens!"" 

Meanwhile I hear other women constantly telling me how it creeps them out, how often they don't even put in their real address and they're waiting for the driver to leave before they walk to their house, etc. They may do this with all drivers, even the ones that seem nice because a lot of crazy guys may seem nice at first. Men don't seem to understand it's not even a personal reaction to who you are, it is just basic safety steps that some women take on a regular basis for a very real threat for them.

> Former President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would &quot;Protect&quot; women &quot;Whether the women like it or not,&quot; a comment the Harris campaign immediately pounced on.

> &quot;I said, &#039;Well, I&#039;m going to do it, whether the women like it or not,&#039;&quot; Trump said.

> Reached for comment, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said: &quot;Harris may be the first woman Vice President but she has implemented dangerously liberal policies that have left women worse off financially and far less safe than we were four years ago under President Trump.&quot;Women deserve a President who will secure our nation&#039;s borders, remove violent criminals from our neighborhoods, and build an economy that helps our families thrive - and that&#039;s exactly what President Trump will do,&quot; Leavitt added, pointing to the White House&#039;s record on migration and the economy.

He believes (or says he believes) in Chronic Childhood Disease. And that this ill-defined class of illnesses have a single toxin responsible. A single toxin. He has no proof and presented no evidence to support this claim. He's looking for a needle in a haystack. He'll send America on an expansive and fruitless wild goose chase. Spending precious dollars that will be pulled from more worth while programs looking for this. All the while driving out hardworking public servants through constant vilification. 

He started the 'World Mercury Project' *after* most drug companies stopped using Thimerosal in their injections. He went to Samoa to dance on the graves of children claiming, with no proof, they were victims of vaccines. He ran around the world during the pandemic claiming lockdowns were akin to Nazi Germany.

"Most people don't understand just how deep RFK Jr. has been in conspiracy/antivax circles since at least 2005. There was a study done a while back - can't find it on short notice - that linked basically all antivax propaganda spread online to something like just 6 or 7 seminal sources who were actually writing it - everyone else was basically just parroting and forwarding it.

RFK Jr. was #1 on that list. He has, for decades now, been a superstar of the antivax circuit (yes, it really exists, and pays people like RFK Jr. millions of dollars in speaking fees) whose propaganda has cost untold loss of human life and human suffering in general. His rhetoric can be directly linked to a measles outbreak that killed 83 people. He has claimed that the suffering Anne Frank encountered was nothing compared to what antivaxxers go through. Etc.

He's not just an idiot, he's one of the monsters of history.

The thing is that they're asking for people's votes and they're saying, ""We'll do stuff with healthcare."" But that's it. That's the extent of their offer. So why are people accepting this? What *are* they voting for?",2024_10_31

This happened in 2018, before Roe v Wade was overturned.

The police were looking into a possible murder. She got 2 years for it, the article never said how far along she was and so it’s hard to say if the 2 years is unreasonable for a woman who legally could’ve had an abortion Or if the two years was them going easy on her after she killed a fully developed baby.

"WaPo in depth reporting indicated  that she miscarried. The autopsy was clear that it was not a live birth even though the investigating officer insisted that it was infanticide.

She got shoddy advice from her lawyer to plead and then got caught up in politics and a crappy cop who at worst lied about the evidence or at best skewed it to her beliefs and bias. In the legal appeal, the judge found that the prosecution did not have the evidence to prove that the defendant took an abortificent that caused the miscarriage. She took cinnamon pills earlier in her pregnancy, which can't cause an abortion. And she admitted to lifting heavy things, which again, doesn't cause an abortion and is not illegal.",2024_10_31

> Both men agreed Mitcham did not have enough evidence for a search warrant, she and Malone recalled.

> While Mitcham aspired to be a detective, she was still a deputy, one of the lowest-ranking people in the office.

They were citing case law, using dense legal terms like “hearsay” and “reasonable suspicion.”

"Have you looked into the fake electors scheme?

This has flown under the radar for most Americans. The disruption at the Capitol was intended to compel Pence to accept the fake electors or force him out of his role due to threats of violence. Pence didn't evacuate with Secret Service for the specific reason that he knew what Trump was attempting. 

The next person in line, Chuck Grassley, would have accepted the fake electors, declared a discrepancy in the vote certification, and kicked it to the House of Representatives—where the vote would conveniently be decided based on state delegations. Since Republicans control more states, they would have overturned the vote.

You can try to hand-wave all that away and say, ""Where did he try to have Pence killed?"" But that would be pretty obtuse. Pence's safety was at the bottom of the list of concerns for Trump on January 6. Trump wanted to intimidate him with the threat of violence. End of story.",2024_10_31

"The last 2-3 weeks have seen a concerted effort to skew forecasts by faking or fudging the meta indicators of an electoral edge.

Crypto whale drops millions to move betting markets. A bunch of crappy right wing funded pollsters (and formerly reliable polls that drop their manipulated poll NOW for influence on aggregator models) all drop relatively soon to push a narrative of momentum for Trump that doesn't exist.

Theres a bunch of political wonk analysts writing on this.

And now enough actual votes have been cast, enough normal polls have shown up to give a reality check to the polling putzch.

It's still close. And has the polls have been examined and reexamine and reanalyzed, there is clear poll herding. They know the industry wide readjusting to 2016, 2020, 2022 and the headed results likely mean EVERYONE is off a few points and we're as likely to see a clean sweep of the swing states as anything.

And the actual results from early voting and mail ins look good for Harris. Republicans early voting erode their ""close the gap"" effect on election day. So if democrats are overperforming early, independents breaking for Harris, moderate Republicans breaking for Harris in any meaningful percentage, she'll win easy.

Trump raging about Pennsylvania right now tells you a lot.

Obviously, this is still close and it's going to be close and Trump is going to try and overturn and delay and muddy the water and orchestrate another coup attempt. So go vote.",2024_10_31

Just remember - who appears ahead today means absolutely nothing to the ultimate outcome. Only the ultimate vote totals. Go vote.,2024_10_31
"Our statistical [model](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/prediction-model/president) of America’s presidential election will be updated six more times before votes are counted. There are few opportunities for candidates to move the dial in an election which has been stubbornly close since [Kamala Harris](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/10/24/kamala-harriss-closing-argument) became the Democratic nominee. Today’s update will cheer her supporters: the vice-president’s probability of victory rose by six percentage points, making the race a dead heat.

There are three reasons. One is the volume of new polls—65 were added to our forecast today—giving the model more confidence about small changes. Another is that there is so little time left before the election. Up until now our model has been a forecast, with weeks or months left for candidates to make gains. Many pollsters are now publishing their final surveys of the cycle, so the forecast will soon become a “now-cast”.

The third is that the race is remarkably close, which means that even tiny changes in expected vote shares can yield large shifts in win probabilities. The most influential polls yesterday were concentrated in four states: Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In those states, Ms Harris’s forecasted vote share rose by an average of 0.4 percentage points (see chart)—a small move that was nonetheless sufficient to increase her chance of victory by an average of six percentage points across the four.

On the surface, the new polls did not look unusually good for Ms Harris. Most showed results that were close to a tie. However, the firms that released surveys yesterday—particularly AtlasIntel, Quantus and Trafalgar—have tended to give [Donald Trump](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/10/28/donald-trump-returns-to-new-york-for-a-bombastic-closing-pitch) better numbers this year than have other pollsters who surveyed the same races at similar times. Our model shifts all poll results to counteract such biases. And on average, these adjustments nudged vote margins in yesterday’s swing-state polls around half a percentage point in Ms Harris’s direction.

Moreover, in recent days the model has been moving towards Mr Trump, and Ms Harris’s average projected vote share (excluding third parties) had fallen below 50% in every swing state besides Michigan. As a result, new polls showing a tied race (like those in Pennsylvania did on average after our adjustments) or even a slim lead for Mr Trump (as did those in North Carolina) still represented an improvement for Ms Harris, compared with the model’s relatively gloomy expectations for her yesterday.

New polls also came out in Arizona and Georgia yesterday with a wide spread of results, ranging from an eight-point lead for Mr Trump to a one-point edge for Ms Harris. However, after our adjustments, the average of these new surveys landed very close to the model’s previous expectation of a two-point lead for Mr Trump in both states. As a result, the forecasts for Arizona and Georgia were unchanged.

Ms Harris’s small gains have brought her back to parity in Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and made her a narrow favourite in Michigan, whereas Mr Trump retains a small but clear edge in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. The two candidates each won exactly half of our model’s simulations in its latest run. On average, they both wind up with 269 electoral votes—which would leave the House of Representatives to break the tie, presumably in Mr Trump’s favour. However, the model assigns less than a 1% chance to an actual electoral-college tie, which would probably require Ms Harris to win Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin while losing Nebraska’s second Congressional district.

The direction or size of polling errors cannot be predicted. But if history is any guide, surveys are likely to underestimate one candidate by a margin that dwarfs the small day-to-day shifts in our model’s average estimates. Any such error would probably deliver a decisive victory to whichever candidate it benefits. Despite the tight polls, our forecast gives a two-in-five chance of the winning candidate receiving more electoral votes than Joe Biden did in 2020 or Mr Trump did in 2016.

The other main source of uncertainty in our model, aside from polling errors, is the time remaining until the election. The forecast works by estimating the candidates’ current positions with the available data, and then simulating movement that could occur each day until November 5th. With just six remaining, there is little movement left to make.

The effect on our forecasted probabilities is counterintuitive. There are few opportunities for big changes in public opinion, meaning polls published now have greater weight. As a result, the forecasted probabilities may change more substantially from day to day than they would earlier in the cycle. The slight movement in Ms Harris’s favour today is harder to reverse in the next six days than it would have been a month ago.

The polls in today’s forecast update were mostly based on interviews conducted a few days ago, so it is hard to judge what, if anything, caused a small uptick in Ms Harris’s standing. Some polls now being published were conducted after Mr Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden on October 27th—which is now roundly considered to have been a misstep for his campaign—but it is unlikely to be until after the election that we have a clear idea of whether that event moved many voters. It appears as though the final six days of the campaign will go in a similar fashion to the past three months: plenty to talk about, but no decisive leader.",2024_10_31

Especially with someone as vulgar as Trump. He needs to pump the polls to give people cover/excuse for voting for him.,2024_10_31
"I would say that we can't tell yet whether that has changed.  On the Dem side, the common narrative is that Clinton's loss in 2016 was due (in part) to her standing in the polls, and the feeling amongst many people that she would win easily, so they didn't ""need"" to turn out, others would do so sufficiently.  (This was exacerbated by her unpopularity with some Dem voters, so that also dampened enthusiasm and made it easier to decide to stay home.)

That has been on everybody's mind ever since.  Ignore the polls.  Get out and vote, don't be complacent.  Etc.  

I do think you're right that we can't ignore the idea that bad odds, that look insurmountable, would have a chilling effect. And, the bandwagon effect is real, too.

But, Harris's campaign has consistently presented itself as the underdog, in large part because they're being realists, but also to combat any possible complacency.

(And, as others have observed -- Trump's campaign is projecting \*extreme\* confidence, not to create a bandwagon effect, but to prime their voters to believe there was fraud if they don't win.)",2024_10_31

"I have an, admittedly untested, theory that if Democrats take the house they could win a contingent election despite not having a majority of states. My theory is based on two key points.

1. separation of powers dictates that the house and senate are basically free to determine their rules and operations by majority vote. Not possible for the Supreme Court to step in here.

2. The Constitution mandates that each state delegation gets one vote. It doesn't say anything about how the delegations should conduct their vote.

Therefore, if Democrats win the house and need to deal with a contested election they could pass a house rule, by simple majority, that states the contingent election will be decided by each delegation electing one member of the majority party to cast the delegations vote. 

We assume it has to be plurality voting at the delegation level, but I don't see any requirement in writing for that. granted if this theory gets tested we're probably already in a constitutional crisis so who knows what happens.",2024_10_31

You won't benefit economically, though, unless temporarily if you're already a multimillionaire, but at the cost that you'll witness the destruction of American constitutional democracy, and who knows what horror and violence would come from that.

Journalists are supposed to maintain neutrality where possible when reporting something outside of editorials. That means avoiding language that implies intent where intent cannot be proven.


You and I both know Trump is a liar. The reporter does as well, but the word boast is a more accurate descriptor, as it not only does not imply intent like ""lie"" but it also describes the way in which he is speaking.

> Just one day earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court, stacked with right-wing justices appointed by former President Donald Trump, had allowed a six-week abortion ban to go into effect in Texas, threatening doctors with prosecution and jail time if they acted to help patients like Barnica while a fetal heartbeat was still detectable.

> &quot;As more deaths are announced, it&#039;s clear that pregnant people in states with abortion bans have no expectation of safety. Josseli Barnica died from a delay in miscarriage care caused by a Texas abortion ban,&quot; said Greer Donley, a legal expert who specializes in abortion law.

> Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin called Barnica&#039;s death &quot;Heartbreaking, preventable, and the direct result of Trump and the MAGA agenda.&quot;Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, has spoken about Thurman&#039;s death since ProPublica reported on the case last month, saying, &quot;She should be alive today&quot; at a campaign event.

"The Bulwark does enjoy its headlines. 

> On Sunday, Trump staged what he believed would be a show of force at Madison Square Garden. He thought that, by packing 20,000 of his people into the media capital of the world, he would demonstrate his power.

>Last night, Kamala Harris brought 75,000 people onto the same spot where Trump launched his insurrection.

Just a snippet:

""United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain late Tuesday called for working class unity against Republican nominee Donald Trump in the final stretch of the 2024 race, warning that the former president would serve the interests of his own class and embolden the nation's executives to intensify their decades-long war on the labor movement.

Responding to members who question why the UAW is involved in the political process at all, Fain said during a video livestream that ""we are up against a billionaire class that will not stop their attack on us at the bargaining table.""

""They will not stop at the workplace, they will not stop at the border—they will take every inch we give them,"" said the president of the UAW, which has endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. ""We don't engage in political activity because we like a candidate. We don't do it for ourselves, as your union leadership. We don't do it for the Democratic or Republican parties. We engage in politics as a union because it is core to our fight for economic and social justice.""

Fain said that the United States is currently trapped in a ""vicious cycle"" in which the ""ruling class has waged a one-sided class war on the working class, and they've been winning.""

""We're in a vicious cycle where the billionaire and corporate class take more and more for themselves and rewrite the rules of the game to keep it that way,"" said Fain. ""They use their insane wealth to buy off politicians and elections. The lap dogs of the billionaires then pass more laws that restrict unions and keep working-class people down. They consolidate the fruits of our labor into the hands of Wall Street and corporate America, and that cycle goes on and on.""

""It is an embarrassment to our democracy when billionaires can openly buy elections. But it's also a devastating situation for the working class.""

Fain acknowledged that ""it's a bipartisan issue"" and that billionaires have ""done everything they can to buy off both parties,"" characterizing the GOP as the outspoken party of big business and condemning ""corporate Democrats"" who ""have also cozied up to the rich.""

**""It is an embarrassment to our democracy when billionaires can openly buy elections,"" said Fain. ""But it's also a devastating situation for the working class.""**

But in the 2024 election, Fain argued, the choice is stark.""",2024_10_31

But right now, where we are is caught between shutting down the economy and getting enough ***Republicans to join us*** in making sure that people have access to sick leave.” - Sen. Elizabeth Warren  

>""Republicans have to decide who do they serve: Donald Trump or the American people? Are they here to solve problems, or just weaponize problems for political purposes? Every day between now and November, the American people are going to know that the only reason the border is not secure is Donald Trump and his MAGA Republican friends."" - President BIden


>“If you can’t do it by September, then you can’t do it by the middle of November, and you can’t do it by December, why the hell do you think you’re gonna get it done in January? There’s never any urgency around this place to get shit done.” - Sen. Jon Tester

>""One-hundred percent of our focus is on stopping this new administration. We're confronted with severe challenges from a new administration, and a narrow majority of Democrats in the House and a 50-50 Senate to turn America into a socialist country, and that's 100 percent of my focus."" - Moscow Mitch

>""What would a post-nuclear Senate look like? I assure you it would not be more efficient or more productive. I personally guarantee it."" - Moscow Mitch on ending the filibuster  

>“One thing! I want my Republican colleagues to give me one thing ― one! ― that I can go campaign on and say we did. One! Anybody sitting in the complex, if you want to come down to the floor and come explain to me, one material, meaningful, significant thing the Republican majority has done besides, ‘Well, I guess it’s not as bad as the Democrats.’” Republican Rep.

Early voting in NC as of 10/30 has it almost tied with Ds and Rs but with a heavy Ind turn out. Let's hope that IND turnout goes blue.,2024_10_31
This is why early voting numbers are making democratic strategists happy even if political junkies like the people on this sub can be nervous. Democrat turnout on Election Day is likely to be much more than people expect.,2024_10_31
"I might be able to allay your fears about the party split and unaffiliated voters in NC. 

In NC, all primaries are open, so one big win is to remain unaffiliated if you wish to corral the worst of either party here (generally, the Republicans.) 

Secondly, your affiliation is public knowledge, and anyone can look it up. I live in a very rural part of the state and frankly don't trust many of the neighbors or our authorities. I have no interest in my wife or myself being targeted for violence or retribution of any sort, and we are both very lefty people who are registered as unaffiliated. It's a smoke screen of sorts.

For the record, even here in what should be deep red, most people are sick and tired of Trump and his caustic garbage. I have seen more vocally anti-republican materials in yards, on cars, etc than I have ever seen in my life. It is pretty wild. I have a solid feeling.

Finally, and this one is probably being underestimated, after Hurricane Helene many of us in WNC rightfully got pissed the hell off at what Republicans and their fascist followers were saying about us here. Making things up, lying about our neighbors who were just as affected by the storm as we were. The people volunteering to help with FEMA and other aid responses weren't airdropped from DC. They are our neighbors. The National Guard troops that mobilized to help us are majority North Carolinians themselves. The slander of these heroes will not be forgotten. Bet that.",2024_10_31

"We will surely find out. I’m very optimistic. Perhaps too much so, but try and find another election where prominent figures of the party, past and present endorse the other candidate, AND 20% voted against him in their primary across the board after his opponent dropped out. Polling methods are seemingly thoroughly flawed this election as they try and adapt to new technology, and have no way for accounting/guessing for the increased turnout that will happen from women, POC. They’re best approximations, and I suspect, though obviously can not know, there are shy Harris voters this time from Trump households and areas, primarily women who know better than to die for this stupid fuck face. JAN 6 also seems to be a huge issue for these republicans. If it’s a tie, she only need more republicans than swing voters that swing for Trump. So if he gets 52% if swing voters, she only needs 3% of defecting republicans. There are a lot of variables in her favor.",2024_10_31

"That’s why I said she only needs a margin of defectors greater than the independent swing. 

I do hope that you will reconsider in voting for Harris, as it is clear Trump has no means of representing anyone’s interest who are not ultra wealthy. And if you’re ultra wealthy, god speed I guess he represents you well. 

In any case, I hope you are well and your community is safe following the hurricanes.",2024_10_31
"Well Nevada arrested a women for an abortion today, so I imagine that the state that was +4-6 all election cycle (and suddenly tied when Republican polls flooded the cycle), will be ok. 
AZ not looking to hot but some Latinos really didn’t like the Puerto Rico garbage comment, so we will see if a miracle happens. 
Either way, both states are superfluous if the blue wall holds. I’m personally afraid of Wisconsin, which has been tightening significantly for months, unlike Michigan and PA, which has remained stable across reputable pollsters. 
She needs to pick up NC, GA, Or AZ + 1 other if any of those blue wall states fall. 
Their campaign has been very ahead of the public polls, always in the right areas. Hopefully, this means they know something about Wisconsin that I don’t, because I have nightmares about that and the little attention they’ve received relative to MI and PA.",2024_10_31

He needs 4 of the swings and it’s pretty tough just to pick off one of the blue wall. Those states generally vote  as a block so he would really need to be winning all those states.

That 4-3 decision in early September requiring NC to re-print and re-design all of the state ballots at the eleventh hour to honor RFK's request that he not appear on it was insane and transparently partisan.  Because the NC state constitution enshrines a right to ""vote ones conscience"", the Republican majority reasoned that would be infringed unless RFK could unilaterally control the printing of ballots at the eleventh hour for his own political ends.  The shameless partisan nature of the opinion is obvious from its face; it's hard to believe that decision was anything *other* than an invitation to engage in whatever chicanery the Republican legislature can dream up.

Do not count on North Carolina.  That state supreme court will do whatever the GOP wants them to do.  They are shameless partisans, more the vanguard of a new politicized judiciary than actual judges.",2024_10_31

Remember when Vance entered the race? He was saying stupid shit left and right. The comedian who insulted Puerto Ricans? Change your tampons. Is DJT going to apologize for that? DJT doesn’t know the comedian and said the event was a love fest.

"Because it’s owned by right wingers seeking to manipulate the narrative. And the way betting works, large bets on one side will literally cause the odds to shift. It’s how bookies/oddsmakers hedge their bets. So if a couple billionaires felt like putting huge bets on one side, the odds will actually shift to encourage betting on both sides which is how the bookmaker makes money. But it’s not a real reflection of anything that has changed in the race. And if you’re a bookmaker owned by the super wealthy who cares more about changing the narrative than making money, you can do just that. It’s literally just manipulating the market to make a narrative in which Trump winning feels like an inevitability and discourages people from voting. Considering the source, you should consider the polymarket numbers utterly meaningless, if not outright propaganda.",2024_10_31
Polymarket doesn't count a single vote or poll a single voter. It's just vibes.,2024_10_31
"Betting markets and pundits are assuming a polling error in trumps favour because it happened in 16 and 20. It’s quite common for there to be a polling miss in favour of a party for two cycles in a row but never three cycles in a row. Statistically it’s more likely that there is a polling error in Harris favour. Even if that miss was 1-2pts she would capture likely all of the battlegrounds.

A good reason for this is because it takes a couple of cycles for pollsters to adapt to the expected electorate turnout. Usually the second cycle of a party polling is where the electorate has settled. But as pollsters adapt their models to this electorate it actually shifts again. Usually this shift is actually midway through the incumbent party cycle eg after the first term. 

There is also usually a challenger bias after an incumbent first term where moderate disgruntlement with the incumbent means a more favourable polling response to the challenger. But when they actually get into the ballot box, they choose to stick on the current known steady path rather than throwing everything to another party, unless things are really, really bad.

Interestingly these wrong track measurements being really bad might be a misconstrued measurement in the Trump era and those people might feel that way based on the overall political polarisation which is actually caused by republicans and Trump but experienced by everyone on both sides. But this doesn’t mean the incumbent is being blamed for this.",2024_10_31
"The argument that betting markets are good predictors is based on the idea that people wouldn't waste their money stupidly.

That's not a good assumption.  Trump NFTs exist.  Truth Social's stock price is above $1.  And so on.",2024_10_31
Those are the Vegas odds. Which is wcary,2024_10_31
"Let’s see. I think the electorate is going to punish Harris for the Biden inflation years somewhat and it looks like Nevada is one state that’s been really hurt by this. Nevada could be the outlier that swings to Trump by quite a margin. Poorer whites are voting for Trump across the sunbelt while blacks are sitting this one out.

NC may be an exception to this due to Mark Robinson and the unlikelihood of 15% doing a split ticket 

Harris is holding up in the rustbelt primarily because of middle class and older whites in the suburbs",2024_10_31

It was $2M from the $2.7 million they bought *the night before*.   They didn’t pull established funding.  It was more than likely a staffer pushing the wrong button.,2024_10_31
From what I read they pulled the $2M in ads because they overbought. Definitely not the same as giving up on the state,2024_10_31

I've been seeing more and more comments about how Trump is on track to win the popular vote.  These folks are simply delusional.,2024_10_31
That might happen again.,2024_10_31
"> Actually, he got 10/10. The only reason why he was 'wrong' in 2000 was because of the Florida shenanigans and the SCOTUS handing the election to W.

But that wasn't his argument then. His argument was he was really right because he only predicted the popular vote winner. But then he claimed that he was correct in 2016 when he predicted Trump because he claims he was then predicting the electoral college, but he can't point to anywhere clear where he altered his prediction type before the 2016 election.",2024_10_31
Yep. Plus Gore won the popular vote,2024_10_31
"If he predicts the actual winner, he was wrong in 2020, since he predicted Gore but Bush won.

"Yes, but, if Trump says 'eff the EPA' and somehow gets gas to be slightly cheaper, that seems to be all some people really care about. And for the environmental disasters, they already have the 'Democrats control the weather somehow' scapegoat. 

Seriously, I am amazed how many people I come across who seem to think 'freedom' is driving the biggest gus-guzzling vehicle they can get their hands on, filling it up for cheap, and cramming cheeseburgers into their mouths.

"The Supreme Court was obviously acting in bad faith when they stopped the count (evidenced by how for the first time they wrote that that case could never be used as precedent in other cases).  But it was just majority likely Gore would have won, not 100%.  A couple studies examined it and it was like 70-30 Gore or something.

Now if 80,000 overwhelmingly black voters hadn't been illegally purged based on their race, by a company that got a no-bid contract at 20 times the normal price, given by Bush's brother, yeah, easy Gore win.",2024_10_31

The administration of former President Donald Trump obstructed an investigation looking into why officials **withheld about $20 billion in hurricane relief for Puerto Rico** following the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017, one of the deadliest U.S. natural disasters in over 100 years, a new report says.

Seven months after the probe was launched, two top HUD officials admitted to knowingly missing the congressionally mandated deadline to issue a notice that would have unlocked billions in federal recovery funds to Puerto Rico. **Carson later defended his agency's actions by echoing Trump talking points** — citing concerns about corruption, fiscal irregularities and ""Puerto Rico's capacity to manage these funds.""",2024_10_31

He just spews racist garbage which he attempts to normalize by framing it with a setup and a punchline. He got away with it for as long as he did because he was not doing it on a national stage.

It's not really my cup-of-tea but calling it and Hinchcliffe some bastion of racist hatred is just wrong.

The problem is that someone saw what Kill Tony is, watched Hinchcliffe's appearances on roasts, and decided that this was a good idea to put on a national stage during an election. Hinchcliffe did his act - which would have been fine at a comedy show, it didn't belong at a national-election rally for a candidate, but neither does Hulk Hogan. That's on Trump not Hinchcliffe.",2024_10_31
thats only how the left has interpreted it. hes said he will use local law enforcement. also feds do this stuff all the time usually.,2024_10_31

"> The problem is that someone saw what Kill Tony is, watched Hinchcliffe's appearances on roasts, and decided that this was a good idea to put on a national stage during an election.

It's on Tony and his crew to not also understand that his material is maybe not a great match and to decline the gig. Once accepting the gig, it's also on them to understand the full room -- this isn't the back room at the club, this was a nationwide special, act accordingly.

all of this is only because there are record numbers of illegal immigrants in the US at the moment. the fear you and others are feeling is only because of the Democrats and the media.

No, because a former POTUS of the USA is so stupid he thinks all non-white immigrants (and possibly natural-born citizens) are criminal illegals.

Currently, 63% of registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents have already voted or plan to vote before Election Day, compared with 47% of Republicans and Republican leaners. The 16-percentage-point Democratic-Republican gap is similar to what Gallup measured in the 2020 election (74% for Democrats and 56% for Republicans).
