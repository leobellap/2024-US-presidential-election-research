"I'm not gonna read past the title  
  
""Why did Donald Trump pretend oral a microphone?""  
  
Because he can get away with it. Donald Trump is held to 0 standards. The bar he has to be above is burried under ground. He doesn't need to be accountable for anything. He doesn't need to worry about offending anyone because he's above them all. He can openly say the N-word and call out slurs and his base says ""he's saying it like it is"". He can lie what he ate for breakfast and it would be YOUR FAULT to fact check him. He can openly take bribes on stage from foreign governments and nobody would see it an issue. He can brag that he got 2 billion dollars from Saudi Arabia and it wouldn't trigger an inequery.
  
Donald Trump is an example of how far you can go when you're not held responsible for any of your actions.

"Because there is no downside for him doing it. Here is how:

1) Trump's campaign is a circus distraction from what really matters. We're talking about him simulating oral sex with a microphone instead of: retired military talking about how bad for America trump is; prominent GOP figures endorsing Harris; deaths of mothers because of abortion bans; his fascist proposed policies; project 2025; his racism; his rape conviction; his fraud convictions; the fact that he wants to wreck our economy; and all of his other horrible policy positions.

2) To own the libs! Now we're all up in arms about something his followers can say is a ""joke"". Now they think we need to lighten up and they can tell us we're too sensitive. It's just some silly BS for us to argue over with his supporters. They'll enjoy seeing us clutching our pearls.

I am not a psychologist, but here's some food for thought:

It isn't necessarily homosexuality.  It could be a form of homoeroticism that is linked to his narcissistic personality, and issues with powerful men.  Amongst the plethora of mostly speculative psychological diagnoses of Trump is the idea that he craves respect and acceptance from other powerful men, a craving rooted in his relationship with his father (by all accounts, a sociopathic bully).  It could be that praising another man's sexual organs has something to do with acceptance in a group where power is everything. 

A more tangible example would be his choice of a mate.  Instead of picking someone with compatible interests, intelligence, education, or even someone age-appropriate, his choice could have more to do with picking a mate he thinks other men desire - whether he himself desires her or not is secondary.  His primary impulse, even in marriage, is to impress other men.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Saw a theory recently about Trump's specific malignant narcissism and how it differs from typical narcissism that centers around attention and approval. Trump appears instead to get his narcissistic supply from people being beat and broken. He needs to see people debasing themselves for him or being debased for/by him. Drawing a comparison with Jim Jones and how Jones watched his followers die before offing himself because seeing people throw their lives away for him was his supply. 

Epstein says as much in these tapes. That Trump only ever seeks to play people against each other and hurls insults and abuse toward people to get them to bend to his authority. It's the same thrust behind why so much of his cabinet are telling everyone to absolutely not support this person, and while we may never actually know for certain what happened to Johnson, knowing Trump as we do, it's not at all outside what he would do and instead tracks right along it.

I'm going to let you in on a brutal secret. Titillating material like this is a 2-edged sword. It is going to excite some unthinking people, and the are going to vote for the guy who served them some porn, and against the people who are against porn.

That's why the Access Hollywood tape was not all that damaging. The facts had faded from consciousness, but the tingle was still in the backs of people's lizard brains. Coupled with the naked pictures of Melania, I think material like this has a very muted effect.

"I think most people are woefully in willful denial of just how common incestuous abuse is in America and all countries. It’s not an Alabama thing like we cheeseily joke about: it’s every state. 

It’s horrendously common. 1 in 3-4 girls, and 1 in 5-6 boys will be sexually abused before they reach 18 and the vast majority of cases are perpetrated by family members. It’s statistically likely that Trump molested and/or raped Ivanka. 

We are happy to talk about abuses of clergy, of coaches, of teachers, to work ourselves up into justified rage over Epstein and Maxwell; but we all collectively ignore 95% of the problem, and more often than not keep the perpetrators in our own families safe.

>Here are some statistics that should be familiar to us all, but aren’t, either because they’re too mind-boggling to be absorbed easily, or because they’re not publicized enough. One in three-to-four girls, and one in five-to-seven boys are sexually abused before they turn 18, an overwhelming incidence of which happens within the family. These statistics are well known among industry professionals, who are often quick to add, “and this is a notoriously underreported crime.”

>Intentionally or not, children are protecting adults, many for their entire lives. Millions of Americans, of both sexes, choke down food at family dinners, year after year, while seated at the same table as the people who violated them. Mothers and other family members are often complicit, grown-ups playing pretend because they’re more invested in the preservation of the family (and, often, the family’s finances) than the psychological, emotional, and physical well-being of the abused.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"> During the first three weeks of October, Donald Trump staged a remarkable comeback, rebounding from a huge deficit to a commanding lead. 

I'm sorry, the ""data"" showing a consistently tight race was a ""commanding lead?""

> Trump moved relentlessly upwards in the electoral vote count, as forecast by the Miller framework

Ahh, ok, so you're basing this off of, from what I can tell, is an economic theory?

Here's some more slant from the article:

> The Biden administration’s policy of sending arms to Israel for bolstering its forces in the war versus Iran, and to Ukraine for fortifying its campaign to defeat the the Russian invasion is deeply troubling to a large swath of the electorate—especially since it’s unclear how long those conflicts, and hence our involvement, will last.

Alright, let's make things clear. Joe Biden has been stuck between a rock and a hard place ever since he came into office, so make no mistake here, if the U.S. refused to send aid to its allies, Biden would undoubtedly be facing even harsher criticism.

Putin's invasion of Ukraine was all but inevitable, and the conflict in Israel has been going on for over a century, ever since the signing of the Balfour declaration after WW1.

Joe Biden did not start these wars, full stop, in fact, judging by Trump's mutually beneficial relationship with Putin and his disastrous foreign policy endeavors, it's probable that Trump helped accelerate Putin's autocratic and unjustified invasion. Oh, I'm sorry, ""special military occupation,"" err, I mean ""operation.""

What's more, Trump's ""middle east peace deal"" was anything but. It was a poorly contrived, amateurish political stunt that happened to coincide with his reelection campaign. It was laughably brief, he didn't even conceive of it himself and he failed to get the appropriate signatures and concessions.

This combined with his capitulation to far right Israeli leaders only heightened tensions in the region. His evidently ineffectual ""Abraham Accords,"" his controversial recognition of the annexation of The Golan Heights, and his contentious order to relocate the U.S embassy in Israel, weakened our position as peace brokers between Israelis and Palestinians while escalating tensions there.

What's more, Trump was seen as such a dangerous interventionist that Congress passed not one, but TWO historic war powers resolutions.

Let's not forget that Trump withdrew from the working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, resulting in more provocations in the region and Iran upscaling its nuclear program. According to current U.S. assessments, Iran could now make enough fissile for one nuclear bomb in under two weeks. Under the agreement Trump abandoned, it would’ve taken Iran at least a year.

During the Trump administration, the U.S. was also engaged in military conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and more than 60 American soldiers died in hostile action.

And despite criticisms from Republicans, it was Trump who literally negotiated with terrorists and ordered direct talks with the Taliban without consulting with our allies and partners or allowing the Afghan government at the negotiating table

Trump emboldened the Taliban by publicly considering inviting them to Camp David on the anniversary of 9/11.

As part of the withdrawal deal, Trump also pressured the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban fighters from prison, including senior war commanders, without securing the release of the only American hostage known to be held by the Taliban.

During the transition from Trump to Biden, the outgoing Administration provided no plans for how to conduct the final withdrawal or to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies.

And don't get me started on Trump's efforts to align himself with Putin and the Kremlin agenda, while emboldening Putin and his greatest goal of weakening NATO. Senior administration officials revealed that multiple times during his presidency, Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from NATO. And don't forget that Trump was impeached for withholding Javelin missiles from Ukraine in 2019. There aren't enough characters in a reddit post to cover it all. But I'd be happy to lay it all out for those who think otherwise.

If only these low propensity voters deciding the outcome of our elections were actually informed of Trump's disastrous presidency, there would have never been a ""commanding lead"" in the first place.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Payway, but I'm guessing whoever wrote this model doesn't understand how election prediction works.  These models are not polls, just statistics.  Being 10 points ahead in a poll means a candidate has that race in the bad (almost certainly).  Being 10 points ahead in a prediction model is barely better than a coin toss.  45 chances to pick black vs 55 chances to pick white.  Prior to MSG, Trump was doing about this well in a lot of the prediction models.  Now, for all intents and purposes, it's a tie in these models, and is unlikely to change in the next couple of days.

So no, Trump never had a huge lead, and polls never changed from a virtual dead heat.

Worth noting that there may be issues with the polls that these models are based off of, but for once, any errors see, as likely to be in Harris' favor vs Trump's..

> that they can’t afford to buy a first home because mortgage rates are so high


As someone who recently bought my first home, I can say that interest rates don't have anything to do with it being unaffordable. Houses just cost a lot. And I think any person shopping for a house knows that. 


Whether they blame Biden is a different matter (I don't, but I'm sure many do.)


The extra cost from an additional 3 or 4% interest is trivial for your monthly budget. Having to pay $300k for a house that sold for $120k in 2020 isn't. 


And I don't blame Biden for it. It's multifactorial. 


I actually like Miller. I find him to be fair about the criticisms of his method. He's interesting even when I disagree. However, seeing a statement like ""people can't afford houses due to interest rates"" is a red flag that the speaker might be disconnected from the community that they're trying to talk about. ",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"> his controversial recognition of the annexation of The Golan Heights, and his contentious order to relocate the U.S embassy in Israel, weakened our position as peace brokers between Israelis and Palestinians while escalating tensions there.

It's clear that Trump, being a terrible negotiator, gave up diplomatic positions where the US had a lot of leverage in exchange for *nothing* in return.  But at the same time, in retrospect it is very clear that the West playing ""both sides"" on this issue has only served to provide money and power to terrorists and resulted in a lot of people getting killed.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"> What's more, Trump's ""middle east peace deal"" was anything but. 

[From this article written in 2020:](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2020/02/im-a-veteran-middle-east-peace-negotiator-trumps-plan-is-the-most-dangerous-ive-ever-seen?lang=en)    
 
>Still, I look back now and feel that if we had really been acting as Israel’s lawyers, then we clearly failed. If you really want to see lawyers in action, take a look at the peace plan that the firm of Trump, Jared Kushner, Jason Greenblatt and David Friedman have put on the table. It’s neither a basis for immediate negotiations nor a framework that might serve as a future basis for talks. It is the ultimate product of pro-Israel lawyering at its best – an effort to use words like “state” and “capital in Jerusalem” to mask a unilateral effort to bring America’s conception of the final status of the West Bank in line with that of Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israel. It is an effort to fundamentally and unalterably drive the final stake through the heart of a two-state solution.

>The irony, of course, is that this really hasn’t done the State of Israel any great favors. It’s one thing to tilt toward Israel in a negotiation. It’s quite another to try to so totally move the goalposts and make any kind of agreement with the Palestinians nearly impossible to achieve.    
    
And then there's this, which almost prophetically explains the exact things that have been draped on Biden's handling of the conflict...and how they were the direct result of what happened prior to him ever taking office:    
    
>When he has sought my advice during the past couple of years, I have advised Jared Kushner not to become Israel’s lawyer. The last time I met with Kushner, he asked me what, in my view, would constitute success on his part. I made it clear that there was zero chance of reaching a conflict-ending accord, as neither Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas nor Netanyahu were willing or able to make the decisions required to achieve one. 

>But I also told him that if he wasn’t careful, he could make the situation a great deal worse. The key was to put something out that was credible and would put America in position to be seen as a party that could be trusted by all sides to work on the issue in the future. Whatever Israel and the Palestinians need to succeed in making peace, what they don’t need is precisely what the Kushner law firm delivered: a framework that may well have hung a closed-for-the-season sign both on a viable peace process and America’s credibility as a fair and effective broker.

The only real change to the election occurred when Biden dropped out and Harris took over, but even then I think his low numbers were due to Democrats being depressed about his debate and interview performance and the race would have tightened had he stayed int.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"They are not even talking about polls. From the article:

“Miller bases his model not on the polls or opinions of the pundits, but on the prediction or betting markets. His main data source are the prices posted on what he deems the most trustworthy, and highly liquid, political wagering platformÚ PredictIt.”

 “Miller notes that he assessed the GOP tilt in the 2020 races for PredictIt, and made the right adjustments for it, as evidenced by the accuracy of his forecasts. For the 2024 election, he’s using the same correction methodology he deployed four years ago. But now, though he hasn’t put precise numbers on the difference, Miller reckons that the betting sites lean more strongly to the GOP than in 2020.”

“The sites overestimate the GOP odds, he says, in part because the betters are mainly males who often also wager on sports, and love taking risks. He adds that Musk’s lavish praise for prediction markets may have pushed the scales in further the Trump-Vance direction, noting that a few Trump “whales” could be inflating his odds of victory on some markets that allow individuals to wager unlimited sums.”

The next day, Trump headed his blowout at MSG, and no sooner did the giant screens go blank than he started losing ground. On Monday, Harris gained 18 electoral votes, and she kept improving every day through midnight on Thursday. By then, Harris had gained 58. Trump’s lead shrank by over half from 196 to 80.

This is the opposite. The general polls are tight, but every other metric suggests otherwise. Anytime they focus on a demographic group it just shows Trump is bleeding support from them. The women turnout so far has been wild. The rally support for Kamala and ground game of volunteers and first time donors is insane. I’ve been voting since 2008 and this is the first time I have EVER seen this many republicans endorsing a democrat. 

And even if we pay attention to polls outside of the specific demographic one- polls in non-swing states like Kansas, Ohio and etc are showing Trump not performing the numbers he has had previously.

Every time I poke my head out to see conservative rallying points (and then fact check) it turns out bunk or misleading compared to the context.

Some jurisdictions have nutters setting drop off boxes on fire. Some jurisdictions have nutters with massive firearms intimidating voters. And some jurisdictions, his preferred chums have rules such as they can contest the legitimacy of a vote for any reason, those have to be counted by hand, and there is a strict deadline that must be met...basically making it impossible all of the votes will be counted before they need to be certified.  

Honestly, while I agree that what happened in 2016 is a great example as to why polling systems need to be often re-examined and re-evaluated, it's also extremely difficult to call how the race is going to turn out when it very well might be decided by external factors that are about as far from voter opinions or preferences as is possible to be.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Here’s the thing though, economists and business experts predict Trump’s economic plan, primarily compromised of tariffs and tax cuts (benefitting the wealthy most) would likely send the US into a recession by 2026, shrink GDP, and skyrocket unemployment. His tariffs alone would raise prices for consumers and businesses, particularly small businesses will be impacted if they import anything. Also his plan is estimated to add 2.5 times more trillions to our debt over 10 years compared to Kamala’s plan. Hers would grow GDP and includes investments via tax cut incentives for the middle class and small businesses. 

So while *he could benefit from Biden’s policies and recovery* if he wins and any of his actual economic plans are enacted the US economy could likely nosedive. 

The choice could not be more clear in this election. On every single issue, the choice is starkly different with both candidates.

Another of those surrogates, again during the biggest rally of his career, called Hillary Clinton (???) a ""Jew-hating bastard"" and immediately afterwards condemned ""these fucking illegals.""

He simulated oral sex on a microphone on stage in front of a live audience.

He suggested Liz Cheney should be executed by a firing squad.

And like any textbook malignant narcissist, all of this is enabled by the sycophants he surrounds himself with -- the same ones who he will blame for the (""mistaken!"") perception that he lost.

Meanwhile, he satisfies himself by grifting people for chump change and making sure that whatever is topping the news has his name involved in it ASAP.

It was ""Harris is slightly favored"" for ages, right to ""Trump slightly favored about a week and a half ago.""  That lead has faded day by day until it's now back to a dead heat.  

If there's any momentum there, Harris would be favored again by election day.  Although I don't know how many more polls will come out at this point.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Our population increased by four percent in one year which is huge. They've recently pumped the brakes on that. Inflation is quite high (though lower than the g7 average). Housing inflation is insane though. While some trends with housing predate Trudeau his immigration policies are blamed for this, at least in part. Canada is one of the most well educated countries on the planet but our productivity lags the US. That's off the top of my head. Personally, while I do like Trudeau as a person, I've not voted for him. It's not a bold statement to say he's only where he is due to his last name (his father was a long-term Prime Minister). One thing I do like about him is he brought in a carbon tax, but there's been great success from the right in linking the carbon tax to inflation even though studies regularly show that it's unrelated.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"We have a smarmy little weasel (Pierre Poilievre) running the opposition. Same bullshit tactics, same three word slogans. He has continued to vote against programs that actually help real people then complains about the inevitable outcome of those decisions. He refuses to get a security clearance as it's speculated he has a few skeletons in his closet including interference from the Indian government that led to him being named leader of the opposition. He appeals to the same demographic that Trump appeals to. When the ""Trucker Convoy' happened in Ottawa he was in the streets handing out donuts and coffee to the people who were blocking streets, blocking traffic lanes to hospitals, clogging 911 phones lines, etc. and shut down a major bridge used for cross border traffic as well as a major border crossing in Alberta. Many of those people involved are currently in court after being charge with myriad crimes related to the protests.

Trudeau is suffering from voter burnout. He has won the three previous elections and therefore everything that is wrong with the country is his fault even if a good chunk of the problems are the result of conservative Premiers who have provincial jurisdiction. He admittedly has made some questionable decisions and many people didn't like how he handled the Covid situation. I'm not a huge fan but compared to Poilievre he is the sane choice however people are sort of sick of Trudeau and we tend to vote people out rather than voting the other party in. I'm very much in the middle. I'm lean Liberal with most social issues and lean a lot more conservative when it comes to economy and crime so don't feel like I have a home with either party.

Honestly it’s a sign of advancing dementia - loss of regulation of urges like sexual impulses are common in elderly persons with dementia. And for someone like Trump who lashed out sexually when he was younger this makes it even worse. This can result in for example statements about sex or genitals in very inappropriate social situations (around grandchildren for example or in random conversations at say a restaurant — we had a relative who was in his 80s and losing it much more quickly than the family recognized and he got banned from a local grocery store after making comments to several cashiers (two females and one male as he would just blurt things out indiscriminately) he would haveNEVER made as a younger man) and/or touching/grabbing at other persons to express a sexual urge. Sadly it’s common in nursing homes etc. I’m not joking that I think Trump is definitely experiencing dementia (his devolution in the past year has been dramatic), and this sort of behavior goes along with the progress of the disease.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

 I asked if they could handle running the soundboard and they said, “what?”

So I shut it down, pulled the plug on the preachers main mic and the lectern, and left. I had a number of people be total pricks and bigots when I worked there and this was just my last straw. I heard from the pianist that evening that they couldn’t get it back on the rails and it ended right after communion.

he has been found guilty in front of a jury for one incident (so far).

>In November 2022, Carroll filed a suit against Trump. On May 9, 2023, a New York jury in a civil case found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation against Carroll but found him not liable for rape. In July 2023, Judge Kaplan stated that the jury had actually found that Trump had raped Carroll according to the common definition of the word as they had ruled that Trump had forcibly and nonconsensually penetrated Carroll's vagina with his fingers.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
">In September 1994, a little less than a year after Tiffany was born to Trump and his second wife, Marla Maples, the couple appeared on an episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. “Donald, what does Tiffany have of yours and what does Tiffany have of Marla’s?” asked host Robin Leach.

Dementia wouldn’t have made him assault girls and women his whole life. But dementia *would* make it more likely he admits to it in public (like at a rally). If he was able to be publicly circumspect and then his behavior changed, that’s possibly dementia related. If his public persona was consistent and he always publicly talked about assaulting people, that’s just him.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

This is Trump’s “Grab them by the pussy.” tape. A presidential candidate discussing women by making obscene comments about them. Women, remember this when you vote this year.

Full transcript and video:

https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37595321

Unknown: “She used to be great, she’s still very beautiful.”

Trump: “I moved on her actually. You know she was down on Palm Beach. I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it. I did try and fuck her, she was married.”

Unknown: “That’s huge news there.”

Trump: “No, no, Nancy. No this was [inaudible] and I moved on her very heavily in fact I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture. I moved on her like a bitch. I couldn’t get there and she was married. Then all-of-a-sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s totally changed her look.”

Bush: “Your girl’s hot as shit. In the purple.”

Multiple voices: “Whoah. Yes. Whoah.”

Bush: “Yes. The Donald has scored. Whoah my man.”

Trump: “Look at you. You are a pussy.” 

Bush: “You gotta get the thumbs up.”

Trump: “Maybe it’s a different one.”

Bush: “It better not be the publicist. No, it’s, it’s her.”

Trump: “Yeah that’s her with the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful... I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.”

Bush: “Whatever you want.”

Trump: “Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”

Bush: “Yeah those legs. All I can see is the legs.”

Trump: “It looks good.”

Bush: “Come on shorty.”

Trump: “Oh nice legs huh.”

Bush: “Get out of the way honey. Oh that’s good legs. Go ahead.”

Trump: “It’s always good if you don’t fall out of the bus. Like Ford, Gerald Ford, remember?”

[As Mr Trump attempts to leave the vehicle he struggles with the door]

Bush: “Down below, pull the handle.”

[Mr Trump exits the bus and greets actress Arianne Zucker]

Trump: “Hello, how are you? Hi.”

Zucker: “Hi Mr Trump. How are you?”

Trump: “Nice seeing you. Terrific. Terrific. You know Billy Bush?”

Bush: “Hello nice to see you. How are you doing Arianne?”

Zucker: “I’m doing very well thank you. [Addressing Trump] Are you ready to be a soap star?”

Trump: “We’re ready. Let’s go. Make me a soap star.”

Bush: “How about a little hug for the Donald, he’s just off the bus?”

Zucker: “Would you like a little hug darling?”

Trump: “Absolutely. Melania said this was okay.”

Bush: “How about a little hug for the Bushy, I just got off the bus? Here we go, here we go. Excellent.”

[Mr Bush gesticulates towards Ms Zucker as he turns to Mr Trump]

Bush: “Well you’ve got a good co-star here.”

Trump: “Good. After you. Come on Billy, don’t be shy.”

Bush: “Soon as a beautiful woman shows up he just, he takes off. This always happens.”

Trump: “Get over here, Billy.”

Zucker: “I’m sorry, come here.”

Bush: “Let the little guy in there. Come on.”

Zucker: “Yeah, let the little guy in. How you feel now, better? I should actually be in the middle.”

Bush: “It’s hard to walk next to a guy like this.”

Zucker: “Wait. Hold on.”

[Ms Zucker changes position and walks between the two men]

Bush: “Yeah you get in the middle. There we go.”

Trump: “Good. That’s better.”

Zucker: “This is much better.”

Trump: “That’s better.”

Bush: “Now if you had to choose, honestly, between one of us. Me or the Donald, who would it be?”

Trump: “I don’t know, that’s tough competition.”

Zucker: “That’s some pressure right there.”

Bush: “Seriously, you had to take one of us as a date.”

Zucker: “I have to take the Fifth [Amendment of the US Constitution] on that one.”

Bush: “Really?”

Zucker: “Yep. I’ll take both.”

[They reach the end of the corridor]

Trump: “Which way?”

Zucker: “Make a right. Here we go.”

Bush: “Here he goes. I’m gonna leave you here. Give me my microphone.”

Trump: “Okay. Okay. Oh, you’re finished?”

Bush: “You’re my man. Yeah.”

Trump: “Oh. Good.”",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Trump was unfit for office from the very beginning. That is important for young voters to know. It's also important for them to know that the only reason we still hear about Trump despite his litany of crimes and scandals is because the Republican Party chose to stand behind him through everything. If the Republicans had any moral compass, they would have rejected Trump around the time when he was proposing to outright ban one of the world's major religions from America back in 2015.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"I feel like one of the big problems with Trump is that people seem to only see/remember the last 5-10 bad things he has done or said, which distracts from the previous 90-95 bad things he has said prior to that.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"* **[Most young women expect words to be involved](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2013.792326?casa_token=EvcYyZ5wHMoAAAAA:dsFZmPGUwuWaYaxrVaBUH9bjVhBME7yrtlbanwrHGets8BlHVJ-RcDN0woR_ozbe4ruQexK0sItoDw) when their partner seeks their consent**. [43% of young men actually ask for verbal confirmation of consent](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/masculinity-survey/masculinity-survey.csv). Overall, verbal indicators of consent or nonconsent [are more common than nonverbal indicators](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919322). More open communication also [increases the likelihood of orgasm for women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5087699/).  

* [**Physical resistance is not required on the part of the victim to demonstrate lack of consent**](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape), [nor does the law require evidence of injury](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/R-v-Heard.php) in order for consent to be deemed absent. Women who try to physically resist rapes [are more likely to end up physically injured, while those who try to argue or reason with the offender are less likely to be injured](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1015254631767.pdf). The increased probability of injury [may be small, but the consequences serious](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24686123/).

* **[Consent](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Vermont&group=9) can be [legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=District%20of%20Columbia&group=9) communicated [verbally or nonverbally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Montana&group=9), and [must](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Minnesota&group=9) be [specific to engage in the sexual activity in question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_regarding_rape#Canada)**. Behaviors which don't meet the bar for communicating explicit consent for a particular sexual behavior (like [accepting an alcoholic beverage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29072826), [going to a date's room](https://prevent.richmond.edu/prevention/education/rape-myths.html), [kissing](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent), or [getting undressed](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0959353514539652)) are at best indicators of [likelihood for future consent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X17308571).

* [**Silence is not consent**](https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/sexual-assault-and-rape/sexual-assault). [Fighting, fleeing, and **freezing**](https://www.utoledo.edu/studentaffairs/counseling/anxietytoolbox/fightflightfreeze.html) are common fear responses, and thus not signs of consent. In fact, [most rape victims freeze in fear in response to unwanted sexual contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological), even though [most rapes are committed by someone known to the victim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape). 

* **Consent must happen *before* sexual contact is made**, or a violation has already occurred. [Legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=utah&group=9), sexual contact that takes a person [by surprise](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=New%20Hampshire&group=9) deprives them [of the opportunity](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Rhode%20Island&group=9) to [communicate nonconsent](https://www.rainn.org/laws-your-state-montana). There is [often a long period of uncertainty described in victim's rape accounts where she felt shocked by the rapist’s behavior and unsure of what was transpiring](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1471-6402.00030). In fact, [most unwanted fondling, and many rapes, occur because the victim didn't have time to stop it before it happened](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17202573/). Most victims also [become compliant during an assault, which is a protective behavior that does not signify consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological). 

[Rape is one of the most severe of all traumas, causing multiple, long-term negative outcomes](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/38d2/cc8df92f64acb9141d6d8ef0d79d0ce2fe15.pdf), [regardless of perpetrator tactics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3262661/).

While that tape is blatantly disgusting, sexist, and quite telling of his own morality; He has said far worst shit that only incites his garbage cult followers (yeah i called them garbage, sue me) to commit violent crimes against actual people who have done nothing wrong to anybody. 

So im sorry if i may be the lone person here (havent read the comments) to say it, but that oompa loompa has made a lot of statements more shocking than that hollywood tape. Like idk, threatening to kill political rivals, his “stand back and stand by” comment, inciting a coup, stealing classified docs (top secret ones too), etc..

But hey if the younger side of Gen-Z finds that to be “shocking” then ooooh boy do i have news for them.

I doubt he has set foot in a church in decades since his only religion is the worship of himself, the church of donald.

Gen Z is shocked by Trump’s Access Hollywood video. We should be, too.
Let’s not forget Trump’s decades of documented sexual misconduct.

Constance Grady is a senior correspondent on the Culture team for Vox, where since 2016 she has covered books, publishing, gender, celebrity analysis, and theater.
In 2016, when Donald Trump was first elected president, today’s 18-year-olds were only 10. So when footage leaked of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women in that year’s truly horrifying October surprise, they didn’t fully understand what the tape meant or know what to make of it, if they were even aware of it at all.

Now, Gen Z’s new voters are rediscovering the infamous Access Hollywood tape, with some hearing it in full for the first time. Young TikTokers are making videos reacting with somber faces to the audio of Trump’s tape, grimacing as he gets to the infamous line, “Grab ’em by the pussy.” The most popular one has nearly 1 million views.

“This is actually soooo crazyyy,” a commenter marvles on one such video. Another adds, “why is this not blown up more?!” Another: “I can’t even process this.” Dozens and dozens of them say: “Boost.” You can tell that the legions of new viewers and commenters think the tape is important and they want more people to see it, because it’s one of those Trump things the rest of us have mostly stopped talking about.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Go VOTE then, for the love of god don’t stay home. This concerns your future Gen Z",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"As a gen z, we were shocked when it first came out.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"I was 17 when this shit came out, I was disgusted and was angered in 2016. Shit was disheartening right before I graduates high school, been voting since 2018. So don't count this young gen z (later hurt back GenZ now) out",2024_11_03,05_39_45
Welcome to the realization America has many morons who just need a bit of encouragement to be their true selves. Let’s end them.,2024_11_03,05_39_45
"they needed to keep playing these, as gen z was too young back then to understand",2024_11_03,05_39_45
Where are the Epstien tapes?,2024_11_03,05_39_45
I just hate that the aftermath was whether he grabbed her by the pussy or not. He admits he tried to seduce a married woman and this was while his own wife was pregnant with his son.,2024_11_03,05_39_45
I was aghast when I first heard this.,2024_11_03,05_39_45
Genuinely don’t know how they didn’t know about this. This is one of his most famous quotes,2024_11_03,05_39_45
Just wait til they find out he killed their grandmothers and grandfathers.  With how he handled Covid back in 2020 with his stupidity.,2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Huh. I guess it didn't occur to me that some young voters are too young to really know about this. We should all make sure all young voters in our life have seen this video.

Edit: If you're an 18 year old first time voter today, then the Access Hollywood tape dropped when you were 10.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

He's on tape admitting to sexually assaulting women.,2024_11_03,05_39_45
It’s hilarious how people don’t realize that of course people have known who Trump was since the 1980s. We’ve seen him for decades and yet so many still voted for him. Why is it they continue to overlook these obvious political career killing mistakes?!?! It’s maddening…maddening I tell you!!,2024_11_03,05_39_45
"What an amazing treasure trove of killer points about Trump.

Essential reading for anyone who cares about the future of the USA.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

I wasn’t ready for that…",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"I honestly had not seen the entire video somehow.

Struck by a few things. Firstly, he looks and sounds like absolute shit compared to back then. It so incredibly obvious.

Secondly, how in the holy absolute fuck did anyone ever vote for this guy? He exudes a level of sleaze I didn’t think possible. No one can listen to this and think “yeah, that’s my guy!” Fucking Christians vote for this asshole!

Thirdly, Jesus Christ do women put up with a lot of shit. She’s just trying to do her fucking job people. Can you please stop being a sleazy fuckstick for like 30 seconds

Please vote",2024_11_03,05_39_45
Shocked doesn't matter by itself without action to hold accountable-  will Gen Z be so shocked to actually go vote!? I am shocked by the incredibly low voter turn out of 18-25 year olds thus far.,2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Most of us white dudes were shocked with this, too.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"I was 13 in 2016, and remember when it first leaked. I lived in the rural deep south, Bible belt Arkansas, and my family were the only liberals we knew of at all in this community, and we watched everyone else, in real time, go from ""moderate Christian conservatives"" split between supporting Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio or John Kasich, to by October or November, the majority already being fervently MAGA. 

At age 13, hearing the tape on the news was just surreal to me, obviously by that age you hear vulgar disgusting stuff teenagers say, but this in specific felt so gross and wrong for anyone to say, and completely disqualifying for a candidate of ANY form of office. 

And when he won in November, I was just completely shocked, halfway in denial and still hoping he'd be more moderate in office and maybe I and others were just overreacting. 

By the end of his term, he did so much more damage than I at age 13 back in 2016 could have even grasped or imagined. And by 2020, I was one of the vast majority of Americans who were directly harmed and had our life endangered by his willful ignorance and outright treasonous mishandling of the pandemic, as I had become disabled and immunocompromised that same year (2020). 

Every new generation who is coming of age needs to hear about the Access Hollywood tape and to be aware of the worst things Trump has done, don't let conservatives white-wash it or pretend it wasn't so bad. It's disgusting that awful rhetoric like that even has to be heard in political discourse, but as many Americans as possible need to be aware of it, so that we not only win decisively on Tuesday, but so that we can stop the spread of the MAGA movement and it's rhetoric for good.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
Good . Go vote !,2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Welp Hen-Z, sorry, but welcome to the absolute fucking nightmare we've been living the entire time.

I wonder how many of them just discovered this knowing their parents had voted for him, and are questioning who their parents even are. It's certainly ruined friendships and made it so most of my family are now strangers to me. But for me that happened in real-time. I imagine this would be somewhat more traumatic.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Shocked has a connotation of an element of surprise. Nothing about this is surprising. It's who he is. 

Appalled? Certainly.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"I'm not shocked about anything anymore, simply concerned.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
We all knew this before the 2016 election. People that vote for him will always find an excuse to ignore these types of behavior from him.,2024_11_03,05_39_45

They kept using right wing news releases made at the beginning of the scandal to support their claims. I linked them the final FBI report on the email server investigation, and pointed out the paragraphs and pages that explicitly said Hilary had committed no crimes or wrongdoing, merely a “lapse in judgment.” I provided the definitive and indisputable source, and they still refused to accept it. 

The MTN videos have the video clips of Trump and other MAGA leaders. If your associates cannot listen to video clips of their own leaders, then no source will satisfy them.

Trump copies Hitler’s speech almost word for word. See 3:45 if you want to skip the intro: https://youtu.be/Tb7Kfg8hzzg?t=100

Trump wants “kind of generals that Hitler had” according to his former Chief of Staff John Kelly. https://youtu.be/pttEmrXdVRc?si=QUjhb2XBZABKIwhQ, https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/politics/trump-said-hitler-did-some-good-things-and-wanted-generals-like-the-nazis-former-chief-of-staff-kelly-claims

The Nazis did not start with genocide.

First, they accused Jews and immigrants of stealing jobs from Germans. They claimed Jews were killing babies and drinking their blood. Sounds similar to Republican claims that immigrants are stealing jobs, Democrats kill babies, and immigrants eat cats and dogs.

Then, the Nazis called for physical violence against their political enemies and the Jews. I recall Trump telling his supporters in 2016 to beat up protestors at his rally, and that he would pay for their legal bills if they did. He also told law enforcement to not cover the heads of people pushed into police cars so that those people would hit their heads. This past month Trump called for a day of violence where police could beat up suspects. Sounds like the Nazi Kristallnacht.

Trump ordered ICE to separate immigrant families and keep them in concentration camps. To this day, some of the children have not been reunited with their families. Sounds similar to what the Nazis did to their “undesirables.”

Hitler told Germany that only he could save the Germans from the Jews and communists. Doesn’t Trump say that only he can save America from communists?

"It is healthy to talk to your children about sexual assault when they are young. You don't need to go into graphic detail. It is important for children to have a basic vocabulary to express concepts of sexual assault so they can better recognize it if it happens to them and so they can communicate it to the adults in their lives. There are some pretty good resources for parents with recomendations on how and what to talk about dependant on the age of the child.

"[Mike Godwins](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/12/19/godwins-law-trump-hitler-00132427) thoughts on comparing Trump to Hitler / Nazis.

> “Trump’s opening himself up to the Hitler comparison."" ""You could say the ‘vermin’ remark or the ‘poisoning the blood’ remark, maybe one of them would be a coincidence, Godwin said. ""But both of them pretty much make it clear that there’s something thematic going on, and I can’t believe it’s accidental.”

> ""If you’re going to compare somebody to Hitler or the Nazis or raise the specter of the Holocaust, be sure you’ve got your facts right. But there’s nothing categorically wrong with Biden’s — or anyone else’s — comparison of Trump calling people vermin or talking about blood poisoning to Hitler."" 

>""I think that it would be fair to say that Trump knows what he’s doing. I think he chose that rhetoric on purpose. But yeah, there are some real similarities. If you’ve read Hitler’s own writing — which I don’t recommend to anyone, by the way — you see a dehumanizing dimension throughout, but the speeches are an even more interesting case.""

> ""What we have of Hitler’s speeches are mostly recorded, and they’re not always particularly coherent. What you see in efforts to compile his speeches are scholars trying to piece together what they sounded like. So, it’s a little bit like going to watch a standup comedian who’s hitting all of his great lines. You see again and again Hitler repeating himself. He’ll repeat the same lines or the same sentiment on different occasions.""

> ""With Trump, whatever else you might say about him, he knows what kinds of lines generate the kinds of reactions that he wants. The purpose of the rallies is to have applause lines, because that creates good media, that creates video. And if he repeats his lines again and again, it increases the likelihood that a particular line will be repeated in media reporting. So that’s right out of the playbook.""

> The question is why do it on purpose. Well, my opinion is that Trump believes, for whatever reason, that there is some part of his base that really wants to hear this message said that way, and he’s catering to them. He finds it both rewarding personally for himself and he believes it’s necessary to motivate people to help him get elected again.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Anecdotal, but I voted early at the courthouse, living in Iowa we still do that in a lot of places.  Consequently it's also a lot more of a 'regional' focal point than a local one, not like a neighborhood but multiple towns and even towns can be crazy different just down the road.  

I saw dozens of young women at the tables filling out ballots.  The emblazoned Trump paraphanelia along the main roads is gone or just the little piddly yard sign, my own town had a huge local ordnance that's likely to pass and I just figured out it was also the 'stealth' yard sign of liberal voters and they were everywhere.

It's like barometer to gauge the sentiment to give 5-8 % more popularity in national levels (i.e if Selzer poll is +4% for R, then likely D is +4 more popular in national level) but now D is +3 in IA so you can do the math

This is the one poll that continued to output good quality results, even in the face of Trumpism and during the COVID years. So them saying that Harris would win *Iowa* is absolutely bonkers.

"One of the main concerns with Harris is she would get the office but continue to feel unapproachable \*as a person\* in the ways Clinton always felt.

Picking as close as you can get to ""just some dude"" was huge political savvy. He doesn't give off the vibes at all of someone who spent their youth wearing a suit and looking in the mirror imagining they would one day be the president.

This suggests there’s genuine enthusiasm behind her and in those cases you don’t need to convince people to vote, they just do. 2016 and 2020 we saw very little enthusiasm for either Democratic candidate. This time people seem excited to vote for her. 

This poll is massive good news for Harris and finally shows something I’ve been seeing myself which is that the polls and what I’m observing do not match at all. In past elections I could tell if it was close. This election from what I can observe doesn’t feel like a close election even though the polls say it is.

This poll has a headline margin of error of 3.4pts. Even if she was off that much in Trump's favour, he'd lose PA, WI and MI easily, and that's the election over. (He'd also lose NV, GA, AZ and NC, and be in serious trouble in TX and FL, if we were just porting the implied swing since 2020 to other states, but there's too much demographic noise for that to be a very sensible thing to do. Just for funsies, though, if you were to port that implied swing nationwide *without* assuming a margin of error miss in Trump's favour, Harris would win Alaska and come within a point in South Carolina.)",2024_11_03,05_39_45

It all comes down to voter turnout though. It all comes down to the women and young people of this country turning out in every state to say no to trumpism and tyranny.   

Another glimmer of hope that I’m clinging to is that the independent candidate for Nebraska Senate is tied with the Republican in the most recent poll on 538.

"Not in WV, Dixie crats were Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and south of there. It was mostly union dems in wv, who have since seen the coal industry leave due to both secondary effects of environmental regulations and coal companies wanting a cheaper workforce. (The type of coal found in the appalachians is more energy dense (you get more energy per ton burned) but has a byproduct that makes air quality worse. Nowadays Wyoming produces the most coal, although that coal is less energy dense although it does not have air quality concerns. Personally if I could do it over, we should’ve kept the coal in the appalachians during the transition to nuclear and renewables, instead of abandoning them before the transition really got started. Carbon emissions from the Appalachians would be lower overall than what we get for the equivalent energy from Wyoming).",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Mike Johnson doesn't even matter if Democrats win resoundingly because that means that in addition to holding onto the Whitehouse they would also be taking back the House and the Democrats would get to select a new speaker on January 3rd 3 days before the certification on January 6th. On the Morning of January 3rd there are no house members and no speaker only a bunch of member-elects and the house clerk. Remember when McCarthy took 15 votes to become Speaker and they just kept voting over and over? That's because the only thing they could do as member-elects was either elect a speaker or adjourn the session. They had no power to do anything but those two things. So if the GQP loses the house than Johnson will have no power to stop the incoming Democrats from from replacing him and having the new speaker swear them in.

"Reminds me of [an article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-anxiety-disorder-mental-health-political-divide-us-1.4762487) about anxiety in the age of Trump way back in 2018. A WH staffer's marriage crumbled:

> Washington therapist Steve Stosny recounted how an official with the Trump administration came to see him not long ago. At work, the official explained, he felt anxious about his high-pressure job in a highly scrutinized White House. At home, he faced a more personal turmoil: his liberal-leaning family grew to resent him for working for Trump.

>""His daughter was starting to hate him,"" Stosny said. ""It was very hard on his spouse, too. The wife couldn't take it anymore. It's tough when one spouse is at war with the children.""

> The patient eventually left his job, but the damage was already done. The couple began divorce proceedings, Stosny said.

Seeing him actually learn from his past mistakes and actually going out and telling people about it so they don't make the same mistake he did is very respectable.

Which is obviously way too many and the 5% gain is fakakta but you're painting with way too broad a brush to impugn ""white women"" without any qualifiers. Women have never overwhelmingly supported Trump, not even white women. And even when ge gained a handful of percentage points among white women you STILL couldn't rightly imply they overwhelmingly support Trump.

That doesn't fully answer your questions, though, about what was going on in their marriage during Trump's first term while they were still married but George had turned against Trump 

George Conway seems to have been on board with Trump until after he was elected, and George accepted a senior position in Trump's Department of Justice but, George has said, he pulled out at the last minute when the ongoing ""shit show"" of the early Trump administration and the moral awfulness of Trump somehow really sunk in for George and he realized he couldn't continue to be associated with and work for a man like that.

It also was totalitarian, with both bureaucratic and military aspects of the state being under Palpatine's direct control, and in the vast majority of cases, they were one and the same. The Senate technically existed, but nobody took opposition seriously (e.g. Mon Mothma) and it was practically powerless relative to Palpatine's desires.

They literally say that in the first couple scenes of the movie. Darth Vader literally plays his hand (get the pun?) against some admiral. As I said it's a mix of theocracy (that's literally who rules it and how it's ruled) and generic authoritarian.

"Nothing would make me happier than seeing ""bobo the handjob clown"" lose her race.  I've said this before but it bares repeating.  Bobo is not, in any way, representative of the real people of Colorado.  She's an embarrassment to herself, her family and our entire state.  At no point, in her entire public life did she do ANYTHING actually helpful for her district.  This woman is a trashy narcissists, criminal and a sociopath.

To her and her orange jebus savior, this is all just a reality TV show where they can get rich by embracing the WORST aspects of our society.  They don't, and will not, ever care about their fellow people.  The playbook is so tiresome at this point.  Find any reason to manufacture cultural war, lie about it as loud as you can, flame the fans of distrust among the most vulnerable people in our country.  Rince and fucking repeat.

I will also say there’s a massive cultural disconnect because of income inequality and geography among the townies and transplants. if you’re in Telluride or Snowmass you do not think of yourself as sharing community with Montrose and Rifle but that’s where all the people who work for you live.  you might literally have never set foot in Norwood, Nucla, and Naturita.   most people in Durango don’t know shit about life on the res.   you have to convince the privileged to actually go out in the world and try to build community with and organize those people, not just complain about them         

 it is flipping quick, though.  it would be a solid D district even with all the old conservatives if the state legislature hadn’t packed the district with southern Colorado.  the fact they cut out the most conservative parts of the old swing district and it’s still extremely competitive tells you all you need to know about where it’s headed.  Boebert couldn’t ever win her own hometown, now she can’t even win her home congressional district with a gerrymandered bias to her party ",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Based on January 6 and Trump priming the pumps again for a “stolen election”, my guess is Trump will claim victory the evening of November 5, his supporters will celebrate, and then when it is announced a few days later that Harris won, all hell will break loose.

Remember, in 2020, it took four to five days for the election results to finalize.  This is due to election laws in a few states including, for example, Pennsylvania, one of the most important battleground states.  Pennsylvania does not allow election workers to begin processing mail ballots until Election Day, which means it will likely take several days before the results are known. Their Governor pushed for changes that would have allowed for ballots to be processed early. But Republicans, who control the Senate, failed to advance that. So in 2024, it will again take several days to finalize results.

Just as in 2020, be prepared for Trump to stoke anger again about “voter fraud” and spread conspiracy theories because a few battleground states will take a few days to finalize their results.

It’s my understanding Democrats have put attorney Marc Elias in charge of postelection litigation, with hundreds of lawyers and thousands of volunteers, to fight what is expected to be an aggressive Republican effort to challenge the results of the 2024 election.

So vote.  Get as many as you can energized to vote.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
Why is he saying what everybody already knows?,2024_11_03,05_39_45

What was your first hint? The first two times he claimed there was cheating? The time he refused to concede? The time he said he wouldn’t concede this election unless it was clean and claimed he couldn’t lose unless there was cheating?

People like GW Bush, Pence, Romney, etc.

"I’m actually curious if someone has made a roster of sorts to keep tabs on these people, especially considering some of them got months and not years. Obviously, there are some who got multiple years but a lot of the rabble did not. Someone tried and convicted in 2022 for 1/6 is more than likely back on the streets than they are to still be in jail, for example. An actual good use of face recognition or open source intelligence would be to compare those charged for 1/6 against anyone who might want to show up for round 2. 

They’ve shown they have no respect for the law and are not grateful for getting basically no real jail time and a few years of probation (in a lot of cases). Any one of them caught the second time around need to get real sentences, measured in years and not months. 

It’s mind boggling to think that the same people who were convicted are actually stupid enough to try it again, considering Trump failed to pardon them or pay their legal fees like they thought he would. I really, really hope anyone found to be participating in Treason: Part 2 is hammered by the legal system this time around and we don’t keep the kid gloves on for the sake of “healing the nation” or “moving on from the past”. We made that mistake during Reconstruction and cannot afford to do it again. 

The only way to move forward after the threat of Trump is to firmly snuff out what’s left of his seditious movement. It will take time, but through the legal system we can whittle it down back to the whimpers it once was.

This scattering effect, called Rayleigh scattering, causes us to see the sky as blue when we look in any direction away from the sun.

Fake news has praised Biden for ruining the country and putting the American people last, while comparing Trump to Hitler and Stalin. 95% of the media is left leaning which makes average people hate Trump. Why is the news so biased? Well, billion dollar corporations fund the democratic party. They work together to pass legislation to make eachother filthy rich not caring about all the humans it affects in the process. Listen to Bobby Kennedy talk about how unhealthy americans are and think about how much money pharmaceutical companies are making. They purposely poison the food, profit more, we get sick, they profit more, they hide the facts in the media that way we are blinded from the truth and they can keep making money.

"Trump actually raised middle class taxes taking effect after Biden took office, while keeping rich taxes low.

His Lumber tariffs started the rise in housing prices… PRECOVID!

He Made a 2 year deal with OPEC Aka Putin and Prince bonesaw, to artificially raise inflate gas prices for US oil industry execs (who also took Covid relief funds), then the 2 year long inflated prices STARTED inflation AFTER Covid because… THE KEY here being King Cheeto the “master of deal making” got taken for a ride… because….  it was not necessary in the first place, and… way too long as a 2 YEAR DEAL!!

Biden had to beg OPEC to turn the taps off before the deal ended and they basically said sorry, your orange clown signed on the line that is dotted. 

The day the deal ended prices started going down and so did inflation! 

There are charts that show an exact correlation, look it up. 

After he lost the election, butt hurt and knowing it would be time bomb in Biden’s lap, he emptied Afghanistan prisons full of Taliban, then withdrew all but a skeleton crew of our troops, leaving Biden no choice but to get the rest of our troops out ASAP for their own security.

Trump is and was a fucking disaster, takes credit for Obama’s economy, fucked it all up, and blames Biden for everything he caused.

He was dead last in background, integrity, intelligence, executive appointments, and foreign policy accomplishments.

It isn't your local politician. It isn't your presidential candidate, It isn't any political party. It is greed on the part of big business. They're the ones who own the oil companies, the supermarkets, the insurance companies, etc... It has long been proven that if you leave businesses to their own devices, they'll absolutely 'shaft' the consumer and have no compunction about it. That is what businesses have done. They did it because there is currently no law or governing entity which oversees rate of price increases. I don't believe the average American has an issue with reasonable price hikes on products. They know and have come to except price increase on products and services. It is the RATE at which those prices have increased which alarm people.

Everything you said about corporations and greed is true, but the average MAGA is 100% sure that further deregulation will somehow help them, personally, though not at all capable of explaining how that will happen.  
And if Trump wins, they will truly believe they are better off economically, based on flimsy anecdotes or no explanation at all.

ETA: The sharp increase in prices in this particular moment in time is a consequence of deregulation, yes, but also of inflation from the pandemic relief they printed all that money for, and the fact that most of the recovery in the years that followed (96%, I read somewhere once) was slurped up by the ultra-rich.   
I certainly don't have the economic expertise to say that the Trump and Biden administrations printed the right or wrong amount of money, but I think that any administration would have printed some large amount, because inflation is superior to the counterfactual scenario of total economic collapse due to the pandemic.

I have to admit Trump is a good marketer him shit tweeting all the time about how great the economy was really fooled the American populace believing that his economy was so much better than Obama when it was basically the same economy in terms of GDP and employment. Actually, more jobs were created in Obama's last three years and GDP was basically the same. This is after Trump passed his budget busting tax cuts that doubled the defiicit. Remember when Trump was talking about 4, 5, or 6% GDP growth? Yeah, it was the same as Obama's.

As a gay man who has seen every iteration of Tucker Carlson since he got his start—from the bowtied, young Republican dweeb trying to seem like a reasonable adult to the current bro-douche who uses the word “dude” like he’s one of the cool guys—it is amazing, and I mean *shockingly amazing*, that Tucker Carlson is accusing someone else of being *gay*.

I always assumed Tucker was gay; total power-bottom vibes. I figured he was just in the closet. Hell, I can even remember feeling sorry for the little dork.

Let’s be honest about Tucker. Even if he’s not a gay man hiding in a glass closet, he is most *definitely* **not manly**. I’m more manly than he is. I probably own more guns than he does, too. I’m also more of a sensible conservative than he is—even though I’m a liberal—because no right-minded conservative would vote for Donald Trump.

In a New Republic article, Tucker Carlson’s recent fixation on Minnesota Governor Tim Walz reflects Carlson’s struggle with Walz’s unforced, non-traditional masculinity. Carlson’s mockery—often using juvenile, homophobic insults—highlights the discomfort some on the political right have with Walz’s straightforward support of LGBTQ+ youth and effortless masculinity.

They gotta hate gays.  They can’t express any affection towards another male (be a best friend, their own father, or their male children) without worrying about “gay” jt comes off. They gotta make their entire personality “masculine.” They live their life like the 12 year old’s understanding of an 80s action star. They haven’t had a moments rest from deliberately performing their sex and sexuality since their first pube.

The very concept of a guy who isn’t worried about any of that, but still ticks a bunch of masculine boxes?  That a guy who will hug his son in public, that waves a little weird, that doesn’t police people’s sexuality, or sex, a man who is comfortable around women, so effortlessly achieves the performance they work and sweat at every waking moment?

But it's difficult to provide and cultivate those spaces, because they're so often taken over and weaponized by hate groups.

"It has nothing to do with feminism.

There’s this idea that because something is happening with men it *must* be to do with women. But that’s horseshit. The only way into establish it’s true is to separate every variable that can possibly differentiate men and women and test to what extent each one relates to loneliness.

Feminism as a force in education has been around since at least the ‘70s. This crisis in male mental health has been a thing since the early ‘00s and gathering pace since the ‘10s. It just doesn’t have any connection to feminism. In fact on measures of loneliness and depression *women are affected too*. On some measures, *worse*.

This isn’t a women-vs-men thing or a feminism-too-far thing, or whatever. It’s so weird that people have latched into feminism as a causative force. It’s almost like a right-wing shaping-the-conversation operation…

The real question is what emerged in the late ‘90s and gained pace through the ‘00s and ‘10s that made people—especially kids and young people who perhaps adopted it early and more enthusiastically—more isolated, less inclined to spend time together physically, more dopamine-addicted, less socially capable, more distracted, and therefore lonelier and lower achieving?

Might there be *multiple interlinked* things like that, some of which were taken up by boys and young men (on average) earlier and more enthusiastically than by girls and young women?

People get super defensive about things like video games and porn, and insist on outsourcing blame for their effects to feminism. But feminism had been around for decades before this “crisis of masculinity” emerged. Video games and porn—at the scale and accessibility they developed and spread during the ‘00s and ‘10s—were completely revolutionary. It would be more surprising if they *hadn’t* had some colossal effect on their overwhelmingly-male user base than if they had. Ten years behind came social media, with a slightly female-oriented user base. And we’re seeing the same crisis emerge among young women, about a decade behind.

This has nothing to do with men versus women or with feminism or society swinging too far to support one side. It has everything to do with the internet and its related forces being revolutionary and harmful. “Because feminism” is a distraction and a salve so that people can justify not changing behaviours they like. It’s like that person everyone knew in 2011 who’d tell you about how this one guy in Peru smokes twelve cigarettes a day and lived to 120.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Sometimes all it takes is a little bit of introspection from a situation that could have gone really bad, but only luck saved you. 

I’m no Tim Walz, but I had a few moments like that. In my early 20s, I was driving myself, my then-partner, my roommate, and their partner back from a gathering a few hundred miles from home, driving during daylight, no bad weather. Less than halfway home, all my passengers fell asleep. 2/3 of the way home, I fell asleep, and drove off the interstate at about 70. Pure dumb luck about exactly where that happened, no one was hurt, total damage to the car was ~$50 parts and labor - this was the mid 80s, things were cheaper then - at the repair place a block from my apartment, AAA towed it home for free. But a 1/2 mile either direction we would have gone over a hillside, everyone would have been hurt badly, maybe killed. I haven’t driven tired since, if I feel myself getting tired I pull over somewhere safe and take a 20 minute nap. 

Same with drinking. I once found myself going *waaaay* over the speed limit while probably well over the BAC limit, I slowed down, and always have a lot of water and sober up before driving anywhere. 

And learning from others, I used to never wear my seatbelt, even after it became law, because it wasn’t law when I was growing up or for several years after I began driving. Then I heard a friend, who probably fell asleep driving, drove off into the median and rolled his car, everyone was killed, at least one was ejected during the roll. The cops said that if they’d been wearing their seatbelts they would have still all been injured, but not killed. The next day I began wearing my seatbelt religiously.

I've also had four people from the Harris campaign canvassing door to door in person, and multiple phone calls. That's compared to zero for Trump on both.

There are a few Trump signs out there on the side of the road, but I've seen more for Harris.

In the last month I've seen one bumper sticker for Harris and none for Trump. Imho it's telling that the cars with the ""thin blue line"" American flag *don't* have Trump stickers.

fun fact... French didn't just give us dozen.  It has a word ""*treizaine*"" for 13.  Never caught on.  Possibly only because the transliteration would be so close to treason... which was already adopted.

"Another way to think about this is that there were 10.7M people in Georgia in 2020 and 6.4M of them lived in Metro Atlanta. The Metro area is solidly blue in the core and blue-ish all around the fringes. And the get out the vote effort is excellent.   

 Since 2020, Georgia has added roughly 200k-250k people. Most of that growth came in the Metro area and most of those people were ethnically diverse white collar professionals moving to Atlanta for good jobs. That new voter demo is going to break solidly blue.  

 Kamala is going to win Georgia with these turnout numbers. The rural counties would need to significantly eclipse their prior voting turnout and also eclipse the new voters who have moved to town since 2020. ",2024_11_03,05_39_45
I understand that’s it’s not an apples to apples comparison and margins will have likely shifted. But I do think it worth noting that there are 40 counties that are at 85% or more of their 2020 turnout. Average margin in those counties in 2020 was Trump +45.,2024_11_03,05_39_45

Even if the fat old addled brain man manage to actually land a punch on the guy, I highly doubt the multiple SS agents assigned to him would allow the guy to hit him back. And that is why Trump felt like he could brag about knocking ppl around. It isn’t like he’s physically fit or anything like that, I bet it’s more about beating up someone who is tied up and can’t fight back in Trump’s mind. 

What a despicable hateful disgusting man.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Long story short in our own history as a nation tariffs were tried before and failed hard. The best thing we can all do is find common ground and agree that Trump is a danger to our own country. He does not have our best interests in mind and will create the biggest depression we have ever seen as a country by his tariffs alone and radical approach to changing government. This is coming from an independent who watches these things routinely. Trump will not help the middle class like Kamala and Joe have tried to do by getting the student loan relief going. I know that some got relief and know the court cases are ongoing. I only wish the best for this country, but a vote for Trump means a vote for hate towards Latinos and other minority groups. He wants to divide us by race which is wrong. We saw example in world war 2 with Hitler’s rise to power and the mistreatment of Jewish men and women back then 1930’s to the end of 1945.

"A LOT of what Donald Trump says seems to be a reflection of himself as if he's at least partially aware of his failings. During his last debate with Biden, he accused Biden of undoing a Trump thing probably *only* because Trump put it in place. We know from years of listening to this guy, Donald Trump is the petty one like that whole drama in Japan with the McCain vessel. And of course trying multiple times for four years to get rid of Obamacare and vowing to do it again if he wins.  

I bring these up as examples of his projection. He likely knows he's the one getting tired and old. I believe it was last summer that Biden was on the beach with only swim trunks on. I don't think we've ever seen Trump in anything but a suit or his golf clothing. It was a really weird thing to say while talking about his ""beautiful body"". That he randomly threw in that it was ""better than Biden's"". Again just an assumption, but he knows he doesn't have the actual confidence in his body to go on a beach shirtless.  

Here's another interesting one he said in October. That Biden sleeps at 4pm and lets Kamala run things. It wouldn't shock me if this is similar to a deal he would do with Vance. Trump can be the face and get all the credit while Vance does most of the actual work. You know. Because Trump is old, tired and honestly has little interest in actual POTUS work.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Well from all the leaks I have read, he is not listening to any of them. Or if he is, he isn’t taking their advice when he gets in front of the audience. This worked for him very well in 2016 because Americans have never seen anything like him. The media created the man, knowingly created and curated his persona as a powerful and successful business leader and real estate developer, yet they would all talk shit about him behind his back.

He was shunned from golf clubs his entire life because he was seen as grotesque and corrupt. Obviously he was offended by this, so he borrowed enormous sums of credit to build all these Trump golf courses that are depreciating assets that have lost the company money for years now. So what does this mean? If he wants to be noticed, included, or appreciated, but is blocked from the normal avenues, he simply builds something to show off as though he IS doing the thing he was barred from in order to appear larger. This makes me believe he will sell all of our allies and our own citizens out in order to appease foreign dictators he wants to be part of the club. Think of him allowing Russia or North Korea the ability to extradite a US citizen or asylum seeker to them for a pat on the back by Putin or Kim.

Then the network TV channels could be propagandized by changing broadcast regulations to force them to be more pro-Trump to keep their licenses, all because they show the truly horrendous things he says.


Everything he does is spontaneous, but there’s no depths to what he’ll say, just like saying he wants a political opponent to face a firing squad. Or suggesting he’d be okay with ending term limits to do four terms like FDR won. Or to pass his own laws and budgets if the people support it. These are blatant textbook authoritarian and fascist things to say. I would love it if someone took every controversial and insidious things he’s said and make one long four hour super cut.

Then we have to ask ourselves a serious question: what are we willing to do to make the country at least slightly whole again? Harris is going to govern as a slightly more progressive Republican, we already know that. Trumpers are 30% of the entire country. How do we reprogram or reduce the anger, bitterness, vitriol, and desperation of them to have a healthier democracy again? I really don’t think we get through this without extremely hard choices of what we ARE willing to give up versus what we AREN’T. Absolutely depressing to think how easily we as a nation can fuck this up and have someone worse than him fill his shoes and complete the mission.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"I think a great many of Trump supporters made their decision in 2016 and have never changed. “I liked The Apprentice. He’s an alpha male businessman. Finally.”

They followed his progress and crap through COVID, and followed the conspiracy of the big lie.

As the real incompetency and grift started to become ridiculously obvious (combined with confusion over Fox News Syndrome) they started to check out of news all together. The stopped political conversations by saying “I don’t talk politics anymore.”

It must be hard for some of these people to wonder why their friends think they are Nazi adjacent, bigoted, stupid, uninformed.

When they reach out to Google they get fed their lane and they remain confused. 

Trump has a produced a Bully tactic. He muddies accusations against him by reversing them back. He projects his actions on his enemies (the radical left enemies that will need the military to stop is an interesting example - his followers may need to be stopped with the National Guard.)

We need a name for this style other than Fascism. Like a political version of the Gish Gallop.

I use to refer to the Chaos Theory of Government: be less than competent on programs you don’t support, then blame government/opponent for its inability to help people. Accumulate more power. Rinse and repeat. 

I do hope we have psychologist researching this phenomenon and updating from early Fascist research.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Arthur said in one interview that Garfield hadn't been ""honest or square"" about one controversial appointment. Garfield ended up being assassinated a year into his presidency, so we'll never know how their conflict would have continued.

And of course, Adams/Jefferson and Jefferson/Burr were pretty unfriendly, given that they had just run against each other in the election. Though that's not really comparable to the modern system.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

I agree with your speculation that there will be LOTS of republicans running to be the next Trump, but at least I am pretty sure none of them will have the same level of brash, unashamed vitriol and ability to flip-flop on a dime since they'll be more desperate to hold onto the donors who own them.

I don't know enough to say anything with certainty, but I can tell you it's a total bipartisan effort. Equal amount of republicans and democrats in an election role for each polling location. There's a paper trail for EVERYTHING, and they spend a lot of time and effort crafting accurate poll books and making sure people aren't registered in multiple places.

There's a small amount of room for a few dead people to vote under very special circumstances, but not on a large enough scale to have affected the 2020 election.

"I saw an hour-long video on the chain of custody for ballots.

*If* something happens, there's such a precise trail that they almost certainly know when something went wrong and who fucked up.

The awareness of this at every step, plus the general lack of desire to get in trouble or face a consequence, means things just usually don't.

Which makes sense, because why do it?

My folks, who are otherwise intelligent people, said they say 'undeniable proof of mystery magic boxes being counted to boost Dem totals in the middle of the night.'

I mentioned hearing that certain states had rules that said they couldn't count mail-ins until the polls closed, so 
 while I kept an open mind about concerns of fraud, I was at least less concerned about that specific one since it seems verifiable and plausible.

They said they saw someone say that wasn't true.

They also said Kamala is a whore who whored her way to get where she got. I pointed out she was elected, and that she must be *amazing* in bed and I am just as impressed with her if she fucked everyone in the state so well that they voted for her, and they said they understood that she got elected but ""most of the stuff that wasn't elected she fucked for.""

You know, because they were there in the room I guess?

What's wild is if my sister were to come to her and say, ""Someone said I slept my way to get to my job"", she'd talk for at least ten minutes about how hard it is to be a woman and how much they are persecuted. And despite 85% of every guy ever manwhoring (including the person they're voting for), this one specific person gets accused and now it's a problem. The supposed lovers of civic duty denigrate someone who has only ever took jobs to help people out.

I am sure she's just as human as the rest of us and I for-sure disagree with a lot of what she says and how she handles herself. But she's not an idiot or evil. Not even close.

The voter has no idea how their tax dollars are used, who uses them, how laws are made. Choice without information is not choice.

I don’t think it was anything nefarious on his part, I think he thought he was still registered here and not there.

Perhaps he should have run as the Loon party that he is and then his backers (republicans) would have surely supported him and he could have had a chance. But he didn’t.

Harris was elected by the delegates under established Democratic Party rules and procedures. What’s the problem with that? The electorate at large is not entitled to a primary vote to choose the nominee to begin with.,2024_11_03,05_39_45
">Have you watched Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 119? (He released it for free today on YouTube, go see it if you haven’t). 

Thanks for the tip, I'll watch it after the election. 

>Even the democratic party of the time ignored county votes to nominate Hillary in states that had chosen Bernie Sanders unequivocally.

I don't know what incident you are referencing even though I wouldn't have called the 2016 Democratic primary fair regardless, but it really is an apples and oranges comparison between how a private organization like the DNC or RNC runs and operates a primary and how a general election works. It's not evidence of anything when it comes to an actual general election, and the post title is still completely accurate.

> Harris was also “chosen”, not “voted for”. 

Harris was nominated the same way that every other DNC candidate was nominated, by a bunch of delegates getting together and voting for her at a designated time and place so that the nominee's name will be on the ballot for all fifty states. No Democrat challenged her, nobody was interested in challenging her, and if hypothetically they did challenge her they would have lost that challenge and Harris would still be the nominee right now, whether through delegate count or even if they had time or the rules in place for a second primary (which the DNC didn't).

Ultimately this is election is the easiest decision in the history of decisions. Do you want a senile rapist narcissistic Hitler-loving felon in the While House or Kamala Harris? Who do you think Michael Moore is going to vote for? 

And for the record I still have my Bernie Sanders shirt I bought in 2016, and supported him in the last two elections. But when I came down to it I still voted for Hillary in the general election just as I already voted for Harris this election. The only person at fault for the unusual circumstances of Harris nomination is Joe Biden, but if he didn't do what he did then Biden would be a nominee that 2/3rds of Democrats didn't want as the nominee despite primary results. He saw the bad options laid out before him and took the least worst one. If Americans are capable of making a much easier choice then this election won't even be close. We will see.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Yeah, we know.

And since then the DNC has changed its nomination process, and the so-called ""superdelegates"" don't even come into play until the third ballot of a contested convention.

Especially if your state uses paper ballots, it's probably impossible for them to not be fair and secure. 


It's a colossal task for your local auditor's office, especially for these last 2 elections in particular, but 100% of the poll workers I've ever worked with want nothing more than for your vote to count the same as everyone else's does, and we all care immensely that it happens. Obviously there will be bad apples out there, but the amount of them it would take to spoil an election...it's next to impossible. It'd truly take a violent coup.

"I'm hearing anecdotal stories, like people in their 30s voting for the first time ever, that lead me to believe this election won't be as close as we've been told.  My guess is that Harris has at least a 5% national advantage, and will carry most of the swing states.  We might even see some shockers like Ted Cruz losing.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Virginia has high volume of two key demographics for Harris - college educated suburbanites and black voters. Will be a decent bellwether for the nation as a whole.

Biden won VA by 10, and he barely held together the blue wall. If Harris doesn’t win VA by a similar margin, it could spell trouble? Not a determinant, but certainly a possible tea leaf worth following.

Especially because VA will report its votes fairly quickly on Tuesday - we will know by 11pm how Harris fared in the areas with significant numbers of college educated voters (Loudon County, Fairfax County, Albemarle County) and other areas with significant black voter populations (Hampton, Norfolk, Portsmouth).",2024_11_03,05_39_45

But guess who's not on the ballot this time? Kennedy. In August, he got 6%. This poll, he wasn't included. The other 3rd-party candidates all got roughly the same response rate.

So this would suggest that Kennedy hurts Harris more than Trump.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

I have a feeling this election will either lead us to hell or show us the old ways of polling need to be completely gone away with.

So something has felt off about this election to me. The polling doesn't add up when you consider it against early voting numbers and the enthusiasm gap. I actually suspect that we are in for a Dukakis-Bush event when polls badly over estimated Dukakis's numbers. I legit think it's because women in MAGA households are keeping secret intentions to vote for Harris.,2024_11_03,05_39_45
"I think the polling issues are less about dishonesty than about ""it's genuinely impossible to measure, and yet measuring it is our job"". 

Sampling is harder now that people don't answer their phones, and ""likely voter"" screens have *always* been a gut feeling about who's going to turn out this year. And this is one of the highest stakes elections in American history, which potentially activates low-propensity voters on both sides. 

So the 50-50 polling that's been giving everybody hives is basically ""lol, we have no fucking idea! could be close, or could be an historic blowout for either side!"", with extra math.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
The exit polls that have come out from swing states suggest she has made ground which is encouraging. I'm itching to see more of those.,2024_11_03,05_39_45
"I have no doubt that the polls have been badly manipulated this cycle.  Pollsters and media have been complicit because a close race up the end is more compelling than a solid win for the last 2 months, but they're starting to realize how bad they're going to look on Wednesday morning and are panicking to set the narrative closer to reality.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"We are definitely in the disengagement strategy part of this election.  With a lead like +10 they're hoping some voters will just stay home or run errands instead of going through the hassle of voting, because a victory is certain etc. etc.  I really hope people don't fall for it as badly this time around.  The polls are meaningless at this stage.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Or because swing states are exactly that? Can swing either way…,2024_11_03,05_39_45
Been some interesting articles on that recently. Speculation that pollsters are herding their results to mirror other pollsters so that they aren’t accused of being wrong. Basically everyone is saying it’s tied. The avalanche of GOP polls is muddying the waters as well. I suspect (hope?) that Harris is going to significantly outperform the polls. Trump is going to use all the garbage polls showing a statistical tie as evidence of voter fraud. We’ll know in a few days.,2024_11_03,05_39_45
I genuinely think pollsters know the actual results but fuck them up on purpose. They only have to be accurate a few days from the election because that's what they will be rated on. In 4 years they can say we were very close on our polls even though they were way off a week before the election.,2024_11_03,05_39_45

> In our database as of this afternoon’s model run, there were 249 polls in the seven battleground states that met Silver Bulletin standards and did at least some of their fieldwork in October. How many of them showed the race in either direction within 2.5 percentage points, close enough that you could basically call it a tie?

> Well, 193 of them did, or 78 percent. That’s way more than you should get in theory — even if the candidates are actually exactly tied in all seven states, which they almost certainly aren't...

> All told, we’d expect 55 percent of the polls to show a result within 2.5 points in a tied race. Instead, almost 80 percent of them did. How unlikely is that?

"Virginia is becoming like its northeastern neighbors where the population is pretty moderate, but consistently vote Democrat for president. Virginia's state legislature is pretty divided with Democrats having a slim majority in both the House and Senate. I think Harris will win Virginia easily or else Republicans would have recruited Youngkin to stump for them there, or Trump might have made a stop there.

"I don’t think OP was saying VA is a swing. It isn’t.

But there is a major difference between Harris by 4 versus Harris by 10. Harris by 4 shows that Trump made real progress with college educated voters and black voters - two critical constituencies for Harris to take PA.

If Harris doesn’t win VA by at least 8, I don’t see how she takes PA. The states have some similar demographics of college educated suburbanites and black voters, but PA has a lot more rural vote available - which will go 80/20 for Trump.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

If that number slips to 78-20 for Harris, it shows real problems with her support among the kind of people who live in Richmond City, which can then be extrapolated into other, similar cities in other states.

No one within ten miles of being an actual political professional stops their analysis at ""Well, rich people in Alexandria voted for Harris so we're going to win Ohio!"" They're looking for patterns in specific demographic groups and specific geographic contexts.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Youngkin lucked out. Previous Dem Gov had a yearbook scandal where he wore blackface and / or klan hood. Meanwhile the Dem Lt. Gov and Attorney General had sexual assault claims brought up against them. In the middle of all this Loudon County school board covered up sexual assault from a cross dressing student TWICE and the board had to resign because of this. Youngkin capitalized on this and played down his MAGA tendencies to win over moderates while Dem enthusiasm was weak. One of the disadvantages of having off cycle election years.,2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Yes, 2021, but very special circumstances and it was the first Dem statewide loss in 12 years across all offices (president, governor, lieutenant governor, senator, attorney general, etc.)

Virginia votes in odd years which is a major disadvantage for the Dems. They don't often turn out on off-years and especially on odd-off years. Also, VA votes for governor the year after the presidential election, and almost always has a backlash against the new president's party.

Moreover, the Democrat was a historically bad candidate who made some huge gaffs, while the GOP cheated their primary voters and had a closed convention to nominate a mild mannered sweater-vest Republican (instead of the Trumpy lady who would have won the primary and lost the general). All this, and the Republican still only won by 2 points.

Also, Trump is running on a platform to gut the federal bureaucracy which is a huge part of Virginia's economy. It would be like running on the ""ban beef cattle"" platform in Texas.

Biden won by about 10, the governor before Biden won by 10, Senator Kaine (seeking reelection) won by 16 last time, and Hillary Clinton won by like 6... I'd expect another ~10-point win for Harris and probably 12-14 for Senator Kaine.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Did you read my post? I’m not saying VA is a swing state or that its 13 electoral votes will matter nationally. Harris will win the state. I’m looking under the hood at two groups of voters that exist in VA which are critical demographics in Pennsylvania.

Conventional wisdom is that PA is the most likely tipping point state - Harris almost certainly can’t win without PA’s 19 EVs. And the conventional wisdom is that Harris needs great performance from college educated voters in the suburbs, and make sure Trump doesn’t meaningfully eat into the black voters in Philly and Pittsburgh. That’s her path in PA. It’s the path Biden took.

Virginia has a similar demographic setup to PA. You have the DC suburbs in Northern VA - which are attitudinally similar to Philly suburbs. And you have Hampton/Norfolk in the southeast which is attitudinally similar to Philly. If Harris performs poorly in the Northern VA suburbs and/or the black population centers in Tidewater VA, that could be an indication of future trouble in Pennsylvania.

Or, maybe VA does something completely independent of PA. That is possible. I don’t think it a likely, but it is possible.

So no, Virginia does not “literally” matter at all. But if you want something to watch early to see you can find an indicator for how Harris is doing with two keg voting blocs, the Northern VA suburbs and southeast VA urban counties are decent places to look.

Or you can just sit back and wait for those 7 swing states to come in themselves. Because those 7 will decide the election - and VA is not on that list.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

It's certainly not going to be January 6th, and it's not going to be at the Ellipse or the Capitol, because there will be heightened security there on that day, and we'll have a President this time around who won't be reluctant to call the National Guard if needed.

Plus, almost 500 insurrectionists have been jailed for their participation on January 6th, and another 250 have been given fines and other penalties.

"I'm sorry, but this part about the Democrats being the most socially progressive party in the developed world isn't remotely true. Anyone following politics in Europe or Canada  could tell you this.

A quick example is Barack Obama ""evolving"" into finally sporting gay marriage in 2012. And it took Biden talking off script to force Obama's hand. Story link below:

https://www.politico.com/story/2012/05/obama-expected-to-speak-on-gay-marriage-076103

At least half a dozen European nations had gay marriage legalized before Obama came around to it.

Canada legalized gay marriage in 2005. 

There were Democrats against same sex marriage well into the 2010s.

The New Democratic Party in Canada first tabled a same sex marriage bill in 1998. Only two years prior, 118/198 house Democrats voted in favor of the anti gay marriage Defense of Marriage Act.

*""In this op-ed, Teen Vogue's editor in chief argues that voting Harris is our best chance of stopping the irreversible damage of another Trump presidency.""*

>I know we’ve all compartmentalized in various ways to even make it this close to Election Day. We’ve avoided the news or ignored headlines and stories because we need to get on with our lives. But democracy is not guaranteed. It is a group effort that requires we all be involved.

>Right now, we have the power to stop Trump. Should he win, we may not have these tools at our disposal again. Trump is on the record telling conservative Christians he just needs them to vote this year and then [they won’t have to vote again](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/us/politics/trump-votes-christians.html). “Four more years, it’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians,” he said this summer, one of many comments that should have set off a weeks-long scandalous news cycle but got subsumed by, well, everything else. He has an [army of election deniers](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/13/swing-states-election-deniers-vote-count) ready to do his corrupt, anti-democratic bidding.

>There are [any number of things you can do](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ways-to-get-involved-2024-campaigns) right now through Election Day: volunteer, phone bank, canvass or knock on doors, write postcards or letters, offer to drive people to the polls, [volunteer as a poll worker](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-to-become-a-poll-worker). If you’ve never called voters in your life, now is the time to try it. [It can be challenging](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBfRCuQx3jK/?igsh=MWQwcnZ1anNyNWM3NQ==), but life under a Trump-Vance administration would be infinitely more so.

>Hillary Clinton comfortably won the popular vote in 2016 — by *millions* — but lost the electoral college by razor-thin margins, in part because people thought they couldn’t make a difference, or that it was work best left up to somebody else.

>No one is coming to save us. We have to save ourselves, and each other. Any of the issues you care about will be impossible to fight for under a Trump administration.

>If you’ve got any anxiety or concern about this election, I urge you to channel that into action. There’s no more putting it off or tuning it out. This is it.

>Don’t wake up on Nov. 6 and wish you had done more. [Do it now](https://votesaveamerica.com/). You still have time.

"No one is saying Harris is that good. There was a reason why she dropped out early in the 2020 democratic primary race. That being said, she is much better than Trump. She is younger, can form sentences, and doesn’t form bonds with US adversaries. That alone should win it but beyond that, she doesn’t have 34 felonies and many other court cases against her. She doesn’t claim political interference when people dislike her or disagree with her. Her background as a prosecutor is a great foundation to being a President. Unfortunately her campaign started historically late and she is still the underdog. Additionally, this country tends to swing to the extremes every four years and the incumbent usually doesn’t perform well. It will be an interesting election",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Trump being unable to even hear someone disagree, and maintaining no basis in reality is scary. like trillions wasted on building walls as a a giant gesture that no one sane thought will solve immgration. he killed 43% More repubicans during covid because of his horrible messaging, promoting horse dewormer and weakening the use of masks.

Now trump’s disastrous ideas include tarriffs that will make everything crazy expensive (thought you disliked inflation, lets make it 10x worse?)

"To my fellow citizens, your qualms and reservations for not voting for Harris or at all are completely valid, especially on Palestine. Nevertheless, I implore you to do so for purely strategic reasons. You have the opportunity, which expires Tuesday evening, to choose your opponent and battleground for the next four years by voting for Harris. A Harris administration will be exponentially more pliable in regards to ending the genocide in Palestine come next week due to AIPAC funding being neutered till the midterm elections in 2026 and the Presidential election in 2028. 
If we allow via inaction a Trump turned Vance administration to to gain power we will have too many fronts to fight domestically (elimination of bodily autonomy for Women, LGBTQ persecution, climate shattering deregulation, mass deportations of non-whites, violent crackdowns on dissidents, and every other Fascistic measure outlined and ready to be signed on day 1 in Project 2025) to apply any pressure on Israel, stop the flow of weapons, and save Palestinian lives.
If we shirk away from our collective duty to show up and do our duty on Tuesday we will assuredly lose decades of progress we have fought so hard to attain. I voted for the Green Party in 2016 as a protest to Clinton's war hawking. I will not make that mistake again. If you ever wondered what you would do when Fascism rears its ugly head, you're currently doing it. Vote now and stomp them back into irrelevance.

"Most commenters haven’t read the article ofc. It’s aimed at voters, mostly young, who do not want to vote for Kamala due to the Biden / Harris administration’s complicity in genocide in Gaza. It makes the point that Trump would be far worse in every way imaginable not just for Gaza but on every other aspect of American life with a focus on our ability to organize and protest. 

When you’re young it’s especially hard to stomach that you almost never get to vote for a candidate who you feel truly shares your ideals. And you haven’t been through enough hell in life to understand that taking the better option is just that — the better option. That incremental progress is better than scorched earth that sets a movement back a generation.

That’s where we are now. Trump set us back a generation with his Supreme Court appointments and nearly a decade of destroying democracy. The level of propaganda and Nazi outrage here that has been entirely normalized would even look out of place decades ago.

If Trump wins we’re finished and there certainly will be no more Gaza. He will give Netanyahu whatever he wants in exchange for beachfront property. 

We’ve brought very few refugees here from the crisis, and make mistake that Trump is including them with all the immigrants he wants to immediately deport. And by “immigrants” he means black and brown people. 

Teen Vogue targets our most racially diverse generation ever. Half of Gen-Z’s population are people of color. Trump is targeting that half of the population, plus all white women who do not want to be baby factories slated for death if they ever need life-saving abortion care or related medical care.

And I think that Biden has been the best president of all time, and I’m angry he hasn’t gotten a chance to serve a second term. 

But this isn’t about what’s best or fair; it’s about what’s not catastrophic. Kamala Harris doesn’t have a great platform. She might be a little irritating as president. Walz might have made some dumb mistakes.

"A bit of a controversial take: You shouldn't elect leaders based on ideals because that's not actually what their job is about. No President in American history, and the vast majority of political leaders in world history wouldn't pass some voter's standards today. I'm not even talking about an unreasonably high standard. Just a basic ideal of what a President should do. Help the poor? Stop wars? None of them would do a better job of that than the current crop of people. Not Washington, not Lincoln, Not Kennedy, no one. A lot of people are holding out waiting for a leader that has never existed and will never exist.

The President is America's manager. Their job is to keep things profitable for the nation, and to guide the nation through challenges that are unavoidable in as steady a job as possible. Sometimes that means doing good things, but really a lot of the time that means making some ugly choices that puts the American government and American economy above other nations and even some American citizens. If you take a honest look at history, that's what the job has always been and will always be.

With that being said, we know what Trump is like as a leader and it's a fucking incompetent mess. You get the same ugly choices except with a lot more pettiness, chaos, bad PR, and bad long term consequences. At least Harris will do a reasonable job of keeping things steady. It's not romantic.

I know this sounds condescending, but I’m basing it off myself. Let me explain. 

When I was a teen I had a punk phase. During the 2000 election, I was *very vocal* about how I didn’t want Bush to win. How he was horrible. 
Deep down, watching the returns, I was secretly hoping he would win. ***Not because I was secretly conservative***. Not because I supported any of his policies. The complete opposite. ***BUT***, deep down in that twilight between conscious and subconscious, I felt like with Bush my righteous rage against the system would be more justified than under Gore. I’d have more to protest. I could be all Black Bloc about shit and it would make way more sense and more people would sympathize with it. 
Ya, I was secretly really happy with how it went down. 

Of course I matured and grew out of this. This naive selfish myopic cosplay ***of wanting to be*** Winston Smith.

"They may not know the dilemma Biden and Harris are facing and they think Netanyahu is puppet of Biden and Harris. If Biden and Harris are not doing what they think will stop Netanyahu, it must be because Biden and Harris want Netanyahu to continue, or they don't care about Palestinians. 

The only people who commit war crimes are Hamas and Netanyahu coalitions. Both Harris and Biden are very clear on pushing everyone to cease fire. They push for the two state solution for long term peaceful coexistence.

Biden and Harris support sending arms to Israel because most Americans support it. They don't want Netanyahu to continue the aggression. But Netanyahu wants to continue because he wants to remain in power and he wants trump to get elected. This has been very clear from the start.

Biden and Harris's hands are tied because they will see more revolt from democrats and independents if they stop sending arms to Israel, but Netanyahu is gleefully killing Palestinians because he gets to throw one stone for two birds.

I would like to see them pointing out how “illegals” pay taxes and yet don’t receive the same benefits. I would like to see them pointing out that lack of immigration is causing countries like Japan to go into crisis as their aging population is not replenishing the workforce. I would like to see them more often point out how “illegal” immigration is a relatively new thing in our still young country and that many Americans ancestors came over when the border was effectively open and that led to incredible influxes of talent in the innovation gene pool.

His unqualified support of Israel has damaged my perception of his presidency severely, but you can’t honestly say anyone who has held the office to date would not have done the same, so he still ranks among the best when we’re speaking in relative terms.

They do on the other hand want to keep government from protecting you and your family from large corporations that poison the water and the food and the land but that would require critical thinking skills.

"If it doesn't matter, then why not spend 10 minutes to drive to the polls? Worst thing that can happen is losing 10 minutes.

By the way, I do not agree with you that it doesn't matter. Because Trump was president in 2016, he chose three Catholic supreme court justices that took away a woman's right to choose what happens to her body. A new woman dies every day because doctors in Texas and other states can no longer perform an abortion if a pregnancy puts a woman's life in danger. Here's one ~~that died~~ that was reported on yesterday. She had a miscarriage and because Trump was elected, doctors had to watch her die because they could not legally act to save her life.

The president has no authority to overrule the Supreme Court. However, the DOJ under Biden established a Reproductive Rights Task Force to  find legal ways around state abortion bans. 

For example, in 2022, they “obtained a preliminary injunction blocking the enforcement of Idaho’s total ban on abortion as applied to medical care required by EMTALA.” 

Here’s an overview of actions they’ve taken to protect reproductive healthcare access:

The Republican Party can’t force Fulton County to hire more of its handpicked election workers right before Election Day, according to a judge’s ruling Friday.

Fulton Superior Court Judge Kevin Farmer rejected the party’s last-minute effort to install partisan poll workers for Tuesday’s election.

The county hired 23 of 61 election workers submitted by the party, but a GOP attorney argued in court that the county should have been required to hire all the poll workers it requested.

“You apply for a job, send out 10 resumes (and) don’t always get called back,” Farmer said. “Some of your folks got hired. … You got a fair percentage.”

Kevin Kucharz, an attorney for the Republican Party, said state law compels Fulton Election Director Nadine Williams to hire the GOP’s election workers.

“There is no purpose in letting parties submit lists unless there’s an intent of the General Assembly to give those people proper consideration and priority,” Kucharz said. “The statute exists to give political parties an inroad into the political system.”

But Farmer said the law doesn’t say political parties get priority in hiring. It only requires consideration and equal representation among political parties that submit names of potential poll workers.

The Democratic Party didn’t submit a list of poll workers it wanted Fulton to hire.

“Please do not let these people throw a wrench into our elections process,” Kaye Burwell, an attorney for Fulton County, asked the judge. “We’re on the eve of Election Day.”

Farmer said an evidentiary hearing is required to determine whether the county considered the Republican Party’s proposed poll workers, and state law gives the county at least 10 days to respond.

"The assassination attempt in Butler faded fast for a few reasons:

- All Trump had to show for it was a nicked ear.  Possibly not even by a bullet.  And no visible chunks missing from said ear.  Good photo op for him (clenched fist raised), which worried a lot of us.
- The firefighter died, but Trump failed to call his widow in the days afterwards.
- The shooter was someone who leaned Republican.  I say ""leaned"" because it's murky.
- The shooter died and didn't leave a manifesto or make a big splash.

That was the immediate 24 hours.  It looked like a really good bump for Trump. With the imagery and sympathy.

Fast forward a few days and you have the RNC (Wed-Fri?).  Now all the news media is covering *that* instead of the attempt in Butler.  Plus Trump is throwing away the sympathy card by being a jackass about it.

Fast forward just a few more days and you have Biden dropping out on Sunday after the RNC.  Biden stepping down from running right after the RNC had to have been planned.  It was a well executed pivot by someone who's been in the business for like 50+ years.

Holy shit a lot happened in the week after the assassination attempt.  I know I'm forgetting one or two other things.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

That said, unless those pictures, or hard proof that they exist, show up, I don't think anything else will affect Trump.  The one line that *most* Republican's still see to stop at is pedophilia . . . but with Trump, who even knows . . .",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Still Trump's endorsement in a primary or just telling his group to not vote for that candidate in the general are still terrifying for the GOP. Spoiler is a role they know really well.

"Agreed. It’s definitely morphed into something else, but the underlying racist core is still there. 

As far as fascism goes, the key characteristics are all there with Trump and MAGA supporters: 

- Ultra nationalist i.e. a hatred of immigrants and belief that the U.S. is for Americans, mainly white Americans 

- Disdain for human rights i.e. desire for mass deportation, rolling back rights for women

- Enemies, like libs, women, immigrants, etc.c serve as scapegoats 

- Belief media should be controlled, which shows how Trump invented the whole “fake news” slogan and him rolling out a lawsuit against CBS for the Kamala Harris “60 Minutes” interview, even though he was invited to participate 

- Obsession with national security and violent tactics to control citizens

- Religion and government become one 

- Corporate power is the supremacy, hence Elon Musk being lined up as the regulation czar to determine what businesses like his own should be required to do

- Fraudulent elections; while we know Trump cried fraud, we’re seeing him and his followers be the most active participants in trying to rig the election through downright cheating or trying to involved election officials 

There’s a lot more to it than all this and we could probably list out examples all night about how Trump’s brand of Republican is more in line with the Nazi Party than the historic Republican Party here in the U.S. It’s pretty wild. He’s absolutely a
Fascist, but I would argue he’s also a racist and a bigot. And a key mark of fascism is nationalism, so there we go!",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Same thing with these stupid ""the ballot is not legit because the date is wrong"" rules. Grandma accidentally writes 1924 on the ballot... or switches day and month... or doesn't put the year...
WHY THE FUCK DO YOU NEED A DATE ON A BALLOT ENVELOPE THAT SHOWS UP WITHIN THE VOTING DATE WINDOW ?!?!?

* every single additional thing you add to a data collection process (like voting or filling out a survey) creates an opportunity for attrition.

The sound guy was the hero.  Every few mins he would bump the microphone up and down and the speaker would adjust.  Towards the end he bumped it down, then down, then down and the speaker kept leaning down more and more.  It was time for the speakers big finish, the sound guy bumped down one more time and just before the finale, hit the up button for a long hit.  Microphone hit the speaker in the mouth before the last line.  Electrics then did a stage blackout and mashed the houselights to full.

The leader of the band was the organist, who was being a total dick to the audio tech, who finally reached his limit and asked if he could, *""...fuck with this guy?''* I replied, *""As long as I don't hear it, go for it!""*

The audio tech then isolated the organist's stage monitor at the organist's feet, and would occasionally change the delay timing, on only his monitor, from all the other monitor speakers onstage. He was their main singer also.

Trying to figure out what was happening while performing live, with a problem that kept coming and going, really messed up his, and only his performance.

> Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not respond to a detailed list of questions from ProPublica about whether Trump wants to distance himself from his first-term record on issues affecting working-class people or whether his second-term agenda would be different.

> Trump hasn&#039;t faced many of these questions on the campaign trail or in debates or interviews, as the candidates and reporters covering them tend to focus more on the middle class.

"Republican party is the party of Unity, Peace and Free speech. Biden, Harris, and the fake news have done everything in their power to eliminate free speech,  silencing people who come out with the TRUTH. We all know why they do this and it is for money. Politicians should have the best interest in the American people, not their own pockets. They do it through sponsorship by of the biggest corporations in the world, passing legislation to benefit them and paying democrats off. This makes Americans sick and poor. They have also increased the cost of living by 50% in the past 4 years when it should only go up 2% each year on average. How did they do this? unwise spending of our hard earned tax dollars and an increase in tax for all WORKING CLASS AMERICANS. They have made it so hard for us to live because everything is so expensive. If they would start making energy in the united states and stop funding the wars (which Trump will do) the inflation of this country will be restored. Trump also had the best economy of all time but who can be surprised?, he’s one of the most successful businessmen on the planet. That is the #1 thing affecting the working class so I believe in Trump. MAGA 🇺🇸",2024_11_03,05_39_45
Newsflash. Not a single politician on either side  cares about the working class. Much less the average American.,2024_11_03,05_39_45

"It’s embarrassing how misinformed this comment is. “Not their own pockets”? Trump made $1.7 billion while in office in violation of the emoluments clause. He overcharged the Secret Service by 300% to stay in his hotels. The US is producing more oil now than it ever has. Inflation, that Trump is largely responsible for, is the lowest it has been in 3.5 years. Trump gave tax cuts to billionaires while raising taxes for the middle and lower classes. He tanked Obama’s economy. He added an unprecedented $8.4 trillion to the national debt. He has the worst jobs record of any president in modern history. He’s a failed businessman and a serial fraud and conman. If he was so successful, why is he selling watches, shoes, bibles, crypto, NFT’s, coins and Christmas decorations? ",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"If that’s true, then why are everyone from Liz Cheney to AOC **united** against Trump?? I’ve never seen so many republicans, many from Trump’s own cabinet, endorse a democrat. 

Perhaps it’s because Trump calls American citizens the enemy within and wants to use the army against them. He is suing news stations for interviewing his opponents, so no free speech there. 

Many economists have ridiculed Trump’s economic plan. Is it really a plan? Does he ever have a plan? All he did the first time was blow up the deficit and lost jobs. I’ll be shocked if he has a concept. 

Trump is not a unity president. He’s an awful and sick man whose mind turned to soup. He’s too old to be president.

Are you aware that there is a massive housing crisis in the EU? Are you aware that there are medication shortages all over the world? 

Of course not.  

Are you aware that the supply chain from China to the US has been being attacked by the Houthi's? Did you know that supply chains globally were hit during the pandemic and that manufacturing especially was hit hard? When China shut down everything it meant that no one was doing refining work for things like metals.  It's amazing in and of itself that the US is doing so well.

Newsflash: The entire globe was hit with the COVID-19 pandemic (that's why it's called a pandemic).  The US has actually recovered faster than the rest of us.  Oh and the entire global economy has supply lines that go through the Suez Canal (fastest route to China) but we're having to avoid it because of the Houthi's trying to sink ships there.

"Plenty of economists have commented on this and most agree that it was neither Trump nor Biden's fault, but mostly due to COVID-related disruptions and corporate greed. Biden did a lot to manage inflation, and the US got off pretty well AND avoided a recession. 

Meanwhile, during Trump's presidency, the Republicans passed tax legislation that included a significant *and permanent* tax cut... 35% to 21%. Permanently. Think about that for a second. It also included a tax cut for the middle class, but that one *slowly expired*, reducing the amount of money Americans had available to them. 

Trump fucked you over. He doesn't care about you or his family. He only cares about his wealthy friends.

"Why do you think Elon Musk spend $60 Billion to buy twitter? It’s because every social media was left leaning biased, fact checking and removing all right leaning posts even if they were true. The best example of this is the Hunter Biden laptop story which has been proven to be TRUE and was taken down on these apps due to corruption. Elon wanted an app with free speech, THE FIRST AMENDMENT, and the most important right in our democracy. These companies PAY the democratic party so they can silence people who know what’s really going on. Why would they do such a bad thing and why should you believe it!? Because they have power and they don’t want to lose it. They do whatever they can to keep taking our money so they make Trump a criminal to try to keep him out of office. Why does he have so many supporters? Because people are starting to see the truth about the political leaders in this country. They don’t care about us but Donald Trump isn’t a part of their corruption. In fact, he’s gotten people from the democratic party to endorse him like Bobby Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbert. The news media made them seem like horrible people but go ahead and listen to them talk and you’d be blown away. Why did the media let these people get such a bad rep when they actually want what’s best for us? Because they’re not corrupt, that’s why.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

As for elon, he's talking and slashing trillions off our budget with no plan for what comes after. This isn't some company he can throw more money at after. People depend on a functioning govt.

"I’m glad you asked that. First I want to start by saying I don’t think Trump is perfect. Nobody is perfect. But who else is going to get the job done? Trump is a very influential person and he knows a lot of good people. Just look at his previous record. I know you’re gonna say it was horrible but it really wasn’t, look up a comparison of data between the Trump and Biden administrations and it’s clear who outperformed who. The most important part of his administration that helped lower and middle class was job opportunities and decreased taxes which decreased inflation making cost of living cheaper. When cost of living is cheaper we have more things we can do with our money, go do fun things, get better food or whatever. When you’re struggling financially like most Americans are today, you can’t live beyond your means. It’s kinda sad how bad the economy has gotten and there’s no way you like paying $4-5 for gas. Personally, I see Trump as a very humble man who cares about his family and hard working people. He will place tariffs on other countries which will increase job opportunities in America dramatically benefiting the middle class. He’s also way more competent than Harris and since it’s a 2 party systems it’s obvious who the best candidate is.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

He cares so much about his family that he cheated on every wife he’s ever had? Second, the average gas price is $3.12 and gas prices rose under Trump because he colluded with Putin, Saudi Arabia and OPEC to decrease oil production. Third, Trump’s tax plan gave triple the tax cuts to households in the top 1-5% than it did for the bottom 60%. Fourth, tariffs are not placed ON other countries. They’re placed on imports FROM other countries and will be passed onto consumers which will cost a minimum of an extra $4,000 per year.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
">As for Bobby Kennedy, he’s labeled a conspiracy theorist for speaking up about a correlation between the decline in health and invention of vaccines.

And there we go.

The first vaccine was developed in 1796. Here are some figures for life expectancy between 1700-present: [https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy#:\~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20global%20average%20life%20expectancy](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20global%20average%20life%20expectancy) Do you want to go back to 18th century standards of health? 

Diseases eliminated or drastically reduced by vaccines include: Diphtheria, polio, rubella, and smallpox. I'd include measles and pertussis in that list, but guys like your dear ol' Bobby K. are rooting for a comeback. Have you ever seen an infant with pertussis? I'm sure you can put your amazing research skills to work to find a video on YouTube.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Being Gen-Z myself (although more of a cusper), i have voted in every single election except for 2016 because i wasnt 18 yet. Every election is just as important as the last one.

So as a message to any and all Gen-Z voters:

If i can make the time to go out and vote and found the time to vote in past elections while working a full time job and attending school with full time credit hours, then you can find the time too. Stop being lazy, or pushing it off until it’s too late, or making excuses about not voting. Trump and the entire Republican Party do not give a fuck about me or you. 

So to remind those struggling with student loan debt or whatever else:

- Trump nominated the judges that would later go on to strike down Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan. They fucked you out of 10-20k of potential relief. 

- Trump hates the LGBTQ community and would seek to oppress a lot of your friend’s rights.

- Trump wants big government to come in and tell you what you can and cannot do with your body.

- The GOP is all for being pro-life up until those same kids end up dying in their school’s classroom and then its just “thoughts and prayers” with the cycle repeating once again.

- The GOP will not raise the national minimum wage despite inflation rising regardless. Instead, billionaires will get additional tax cuts while forcing lower income families to pay more taxes. Lower waged workers will be paying more while the rich enjoy the extra couple million in bonuses. That is not fair. 

- worried about the job market post-grad? It will be much much worse than it seems now

I could keep going. But my point is that Trump does not give a fuck about anybody but himself. He is only loyal to the money and only loyal to the highest bidder. He is an unstable, pedophile, who’s only goal in a hypothetical 2nd Term is to get revenge on anybody who he deems deserves such. That’s not a leader.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Let me just address this “for all the people” thing. This is way different than “smirky remarks” from Harris. They are not equivalent, and I think you understand that.

Trump tried to illegally overturn an election without evidence. He said that my vote was fraudulent. I live in WI, I was a municipal clerk, and I worked on the recount. He asked GA to find him votes to win. He tried to litigate his way past fair election losses across the country, without evidence. If that isn’t sidelining a group, half of the electorate, I don’t know what to tell you.

He said “so what” to his crowd wanting to kill Mike Pence. He sure wasn’t for that guy.

In 2016 he really hammered on racist tropes and “they’re not sending their best”. There are shitty people of all backgrounds and it’s wrong to take the immigration discussion to that place. I have Mexican in-laws that I love very much. He isn’t for those people.

He approved a toxic joke denigrating Puerto Rico. He isn’t for those people.

Trump has encouraged security/crowds to beat up protestors. He isn’t for those people.

Trump has talked about using the US military against what he calls “the enemy within”. He isn’t for those people.

Finally, regarding the “motive” to run. How is that a red flag? Some people run because they think they can make the country better. And yes, we can talk about the prosecution being Trump’s reason to run: of course the cases would be happening even if he wasn’t running, he is alleged to have broken many federal laws. You think people should get away with that just because they are private citizens? You and I wouldn’t. I would argue that it’s a way better look for Harris running on improving our country’s wellbeing vs Trump running to stop his litigation. It’s quite damning that you can look at a negative reason for Trump running, see nothing of the sort about Harris, and then think “man that must be bad about Harris”.

And, pure reasons. My goodness, the guy has never been transparent. He did not release his tax returns, or his medical records. He didn’t even release a healthcare plan. Musk admitted that the economy will crash under his economic plan.

If you watch the debate (please do so) or really any rally, you would see that Harris clearly and forcefully articulates her plans for America. She isn’t cackling and talking in circles. Trump literally spends time at rallies talking about Hannibal Lecter, Arnold Palmer’s dick, and simulating a blowjob on a microphone. You think that’s better on the international stage?

Look I think it’s really clear from these examples that you have not applied your criticism equally to both sides. It’s laughably bad that you think Kamala talks in circles and laughs too much after every gaffe Trump has had in the last week alone.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Millennials can be argued to start at 1980.

This ignores the microgap of those born in '88-96. This is the ""Pokemon generation"" or the ""Max Martin musical acts"" generation(Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, N'Sync would be the talk of many pre-teens and teens). They were minors, but they might have noticed the 2000 election being stuck in a recount, and feeling sympathetic to Gore and the environmental message. 9/11 occurred in middle or elementary school, so they weren't served up for military meat initially, but some might have joined after 2006.

Financial crisis '08 hit them right when they were in college or graduating from it.

Yet the original poster thinks this is generation that only consumed South park and The Simpsons to shape their outlook.

The only political Simpsons ep I remember was the Clinton-Dole alien episode, and that episode's point was that the masses are so stupid, they couldn't recognize real politicians from aliens or realize whatever they say(which is true, as politicians are generally engaging in lawyer speak--they are often precisely laywers--while the masses think it's custom, personal message) is pretty much nonsense.

The Monica Lewinsky scandal would have passed over the heads of these later millennial children then, because it just wasn't time for puberty yet; thus the Clintons scandals did not effect the general millennial outlook towards them.

"I’m not on a computer, so I can’t make too lengthy of a reply. I think anyone can agree that questioning the election, or double checking is a fine task to do, no? The election was extremely close as far as the electoral college goes. Asking people to do illegal tasks doesn’t have much integrity and should be frowned upon. Donald’s Trumps rallies however, I’ve seen some clips, I saw the Puerto Rican joke. I thought it was a bad joke, and I don’t think the campaign approved of it beforehand based on what I’ve heard. However, it’s on a similar level of Dave Chappelle’s jokes with the transgender community. 

Just to let you know, my hopes were on Ron Desantis to be nominee or this one guy that couldn’t even gain enough ground to be allowed on the debate stage. Every week he was a couple points behind as they kept raising the cap as time went on the choose a nominee. There’s no world where you were hoping Kamala would be running for president in 2024, it just wasn’t happening. It wasn’t anyone’s pick. Everything Kamala has done in the spotlight has been heavily rehearsed, which isn’t a bad thing, but isn’t a good thing when you don’t get new lines. Kamala was never actually nominated against other candidates, although I understand that the circumstances had put her in the best position to be nominee (including the Biden and Harris campaign money). 

Trumps medical records, taxes, etc. I personally think is a private matter and a matter of privacy for all citizens. If he wishes to share it, he could. 

I really don’t think someone who’s been shot once and almost shot again playing golf would continue running for the wrong reasons. I would think many politicians would quit after the first shot. 

I have looked at both though, I watched most of the DNC. I watched the presidential debate, I’ve watched parts of her rallies if it’s on the TV. I don’t think anyone wants the same thing as the last four years, maybe some people do, but I don’t. 

I had mentioned to my democratic uncle after I watched the DNC that it was nice to see the DNC repping a lot of the colors of the American flag, something that a lot of woke democrats push aside as they think it stands for imperialism.

"> > all of those bad political things are their fault now?

> This is a a straw man.

Given that the post I replied to is now deleted, I can't go back and check, but no, it wasn't. Millennials are not responsible for every fucked up thing in the US just because they were alive when they happened.

> Furthermore, you can't have your cake and it eat it too. If Millennials are gonna take credit for electing Obama, they should also be condemned for not helping Hillary or Kerry or Gore, but Hillary especially.

By your own definition, millennials didn't have a lot of voting power for the Gore and Kerry elections. It was only during the Obama campaign that millennials finally had enough numbers to start changing elections.

And millennials, like every other age demographic, share part of the blame for the Hillary vs. Trump years. Absolutely. But they are not primarily to blame for the events that happened while most of them weren't old enough to be eligible to vote.

> I'm a Gen Zer. But in any case, instead of telling other people to go back to bed, you should tell young people to go out and vote.

Hey, thanks for your permission to do so - I've already been doing both.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"He literally asked GA to find him votes. That is blatantly illegal. All of the cases he brought had no evidence, and he knew that, case closed. His lies resulted in people dying.

Taxes are not a private matter for presidents because they can show foreign debt and conflicts of interest. Medical records are important, especially for an elderly candidate. Don’t you want to know if he is physically capable and of sound mind to hold office? Harris released hers. Transparency matters.

Plenty of “free thinkers” in the Democratic Party. Again, Harris is currently endorsed by people ranging from Sanders to Dick Cheney. That is hardly “all or nothing, you have to agree with all of it to join us”.

And yes he would run after being shot at if he was afraid of pending litigation.

And yes obviously the campaign vetted the entire routine and put it on the teleprompter. No campaign lets someone on stage without clear instruction of what to say. They even made him drop a joke calling Harris a c**t.

All that stuff, the election interference, the Cheney-in-the-firing-squad, the bad hombres, the “knock those guys around”, the “good people on both sides” (regarding a Nazi march), the “enemy within”. You are saying those things are your values. You’re saying he’s running for pure reasons, *while saying these things repeatedly*. I would not be proud of these values or that they are not dealbreakers. You have not conjured anything remotely similar to show why Harris has worse values than Trump.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"\>Given that the post I replied to is now deleted, I can't go back and check, but no, it wasn't.

Yes, it was. I did not pin the election losses exclusively on the Millennials, I am pinning the elections on the non-voters. And sorry to break it to you, but for a generation that likes to bitch about how the Boomers have ruined their lives, the Millennials haven't really done much to do the bare minimum to fight back; voting. At least the Gen Zers have made historic turnouts since 2018 (albeit they're not doing enough).

\>By your own definition, millennials didn't have a lot of voting power for the Gore and Kerry elections.

Wrong. There were already millions of young adult Millennials back in the Gore and Kerry days: [https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/age-distribution-for-united-states-population.html](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/age-distribution-for-united-states-population.html)

Those Millennials certainly had a lot of power in the swing states.

\>But they are not primarily to blame for the events that happened while most of them weren't old enough to be eligible to vote.

I didn't say they were primarily to blame, that is not the point. The point that u/ Hardass\_McBadCop was making is that the reason why Boomers have dominant influence over public policy is because they are the ones who are voting most of the time. It wouldn't be that way if Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Zers had mobilized. And the fact is that Millennials DID have the chance to elect Gore and Kerry. Not mention they didn't show up for Hillary, who should have easily won 2016.

The Millennials and the Gen Zers will have to act more responsibly and take action to fight back against the policies that are harming them instead bitching on the internet about old people having all the power. You want to get rid of the Boomers? Vote them out.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"I'm not sure he edited it before I responded, I just wasn't very clear stressing the sex divide in my response. Basically it's this: there is a significant gender divide among Gen Z in regards to candidate support. *But*, Harris is still favored by both groups: overwhelmingly by women and slightly by men. In the Harvard study I posted (which as I said was a much larger sample than the Sienna poll I see cited in a lot of these articles) the gap among likely male Gen Z voters is actually much bigger: 53%-37% and Women are more like 70%-30%. Still a big gap, but both strongly favoring Harris

What OP keeps posting is an article about how Trump is attempting to activate the Apolitical young male vote to try and flip those numbers. This isn't a surprise, it's Steve Bannon's playbook and exactly what he did in 2016, only back then it was going on infowars and seeding the memesphere on places like Reddit and the Chans. The medium now has shifted to the podcast influencer griftsphere, but it's the same thing. What I think will make a huge difference is Harris's social media game is so much better than Hillary's was  in 2016 and she is much more personable and engaging, so she will hold strong in the demographic",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Well I think it all starts with Harris having mostly (over 50%) good national publicity from news outlets and Trump having most negative (over 50%) bad national publicity from news outlets. 

The “good people on both sides” is laughably  false as I’ve looked into it deeply. It was extremely hard to find the full clip. 

We can agree to disagree, I’m not saying I’m better or worse than you and I don’t think you are either.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

> A video purporting to show recently arrived Haitian immigrants illegally voting in Georgia for Kamala Harris was produced by a Russian government-backed disinformation unit, according to US authorities.

> Though the agencies didn&#039;t specifically name a particular source for the videos, disinformation experts, including Darren Linvill of Clemson University, pointed out that the voting video strongly resembles earlier ones produced by Storm-1516, a Russian government-backed propaganda unit that has been targeting the Harris-Walz campaign for months.

> While AlphaFox78&#039;s post has been deleted, screenshots of the video are still spreading widely on X. &quot;This Russian activity is part of Moscow&#039;s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the US election and stoke divisions among Americans,&quot; the intelligence agencies wrote.

And I like this quote from Ann, I think it applies again to this election: 

> While she could share no secret recipe to an accurate poll, Selzer emphasized her ""polling forward"" methodology: focusing on the new data, rather than trying to force trends from previous election cycles or polls. 

> ""They think that what happened in the last election will be constant. And public opinion, by its very nature, is not constant,"" she said. ""The makeup of the electorate changes enough that you can be blinded from the freight train that’s coming right toward you if your head is turned around looking backward at what happened before.”",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Selzer is FANTASTIC. Earlier people were saying Trump +5 would bode poorly for him. Kamala +3 in the Selzer poll is deadass CATASTROPHIC for him.

">The results follow a September Iowa Poll that showed Trump with a 4-point lead over Harris and a June Iowa Poll showing him with an 18-point lead over Democratic President Joe Biden, who was the presumed Democratic nominee at the time.  

>“It’s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,” said pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co. “She has clearly leaped into a leading position.”

* Democrat Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump in Iowa 47% to 44%, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.
* A victory for Harris would be a shocking development after Iowa has swung aggressively to the right in recent elections, delivering Trump solid victories in 2016 and 2020.
* The poll shows that women — particularly those who are older or are politically independent — are driving the late shift toward Harris.
* Trump continues to lead with his core base of support: men, evangelicals, rural residents and those without a college degree.

Here's an [archived (free) version](https://archive.is/UqdGz) if you need.

Some background on why the Iowa Poll gets lots of attention: [From 'terrible' to golden, Ann Selzer and the Iowa Poll were proved right, again](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/04/iowa-poll-closely-matches-election-results-how-did-ann-selzer-do-it/6159615002)

For context, before Biden dropped out, Trump was up by 18-points in the same poll from June. Harris cut it to 4-points in their September poll. Today's is their final poll and she jumped another 7-points to +3. The Harris campaign probably would’ve been happy with Trump +4 again because they weren’t expecting her to win Iowa (Trump won Iowa in 2020 by 8-points). This is bananas and it's gonna be all over the news.

On more thing for Harris supporters: [Blue Voter Guide](https://bluevoterguide.org/) helps with YOUR specific ballot. It’s great for ballot propositions, as well as candidates without a (D) or (R) after their name (judges, commissioners, dog catcher). For each candidate/proposition, it has endorsements from trusted, forward-looking organizations. This website saved me significant time & effort.

I literally was saying this to a friend working as political director of a PAC a couple days after early voting started. Dems have maintained a doubled early voting margin and unaffiliated votes surpassed 2020 levels. I literally sent him my 270 map with oredictions from early voting and deep analytics on Oct 24. Iowa is going Harris. I also have Harris winning Texas as early voting levels in Texas are only 500k off from 2020 early voting when early voting was at its highest from COVID. Early voting turnout is still up post COVID but not 2020 levels because not many are doing mail ins. Also a lot will take advantage of paid tine off allowed to vote from workplaces again so turnout will be a lot higher on election day.,2024_11_03,05_39_45

Inflation - it’s 2.1% at the moment, right where the Fed wants it.  Biden omits is working.  Nobel pride winners say it will spike again if Trump wins. 

Jobs - Unemployment is low.  Wages are trending up. 

Climate (big in Iowa) - gets worse faster under Trump, and the storms, floods, and droughts will be more severe

"Yeah it's kinda difficult to overstate how insanely bullish for Kamala this poll is. Selzer is arguably the best pollster in the COUNTRY, she's absolutely nailed Iowa in basically every recent election when no one else was close. (2018 governorship was her only miss, still within her margin of error tho)

The margin of error in this poll was 3.4, which doubles because you have to apply it to both candidates. That means in the absolute most pessimistically incorrect error, Trump has a 3.4% lead in Iowa. Iowa has been arguably the furthest right of the Midwest in recent years. If he squeaks out a 49%-46% win there, he almost certainly gets absolutely whomped in the Rust Belt, and is arguably at risk of losing Indiana and Ohio

"To be fair, the same pollster correctly forecast that Hillary was in serious trouble based on her polling in 2016 and showed that 2020 would be tight, slightly favoring Biden. Iowa tends to lean +8 towards the Republicans vs the national average. A Trump +3 in Iowa result from the same gold star pollster would be devastating news for Trump and indicate he would be losing the swing states. The result in this poll is Harris +3 and hints that other pollsters might have been weighting their polls incorrectly and missed some important trends, as happened in both 2016 and 2020 from other pollsters. The leading hunch I heard is that other pollsters are missing movements among non-college educated white women, particularly older white women 70+ towards Harris over Trump. When you look at Selzer’s granular data, older white women are breaking for Harris 2-to-1. That is a huge swing and is a fairly numerous group that is fairly dependable at showing up to the polls.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Obama had won Iowa in both 2008 and 2012 and her having Hillary down by 9 points was shocking to people. It turns out Trump won the state by 8 points.

The 3.4% is +/- on *either* side not both. If you poll the outcome is 45:55 +/- 5 you obviously can’t have 55:60 or 40:50, it has to sum to 100.

There’s some slight technicality here in that this doesn’t add to 100 since people could vote neither, but it is still capped at 100 and they are still not independent variables. This is all taken into account already when the 3.4 number is reported as the uncertainty. However, uncertainty also isnt a guarantee it falls within that range. There’s a lot of factors that can could affect the accuracy but weren’t accounted for or it could just be a statistical outlier.

You guys are still stuck on the idea that people hate him because of ""mean tweets."" People voted him out because he was a terrible president. Mean tweets barely factored in to that decision.

His first two years were spent coasting on the economy he inherited from Obama. The last two years were a complete shit show. The manufacturing sector was in a recession all of 2019 because of his trade war, and we were going to experience an economy-wide downturn in his last year even without covid—and then he went and completely fucked that up.

Again, I can't stress this enough: It's not just about ""mean tweets."" It's not that he needs to get a filter.

"I can understand you listing out your important issues and saying that your preferred solutions are more in line with the Republican Party's beliefs. That's fine. I was a Republican many years ago, so I understand where you're coming from.

What I'll never understand is how you can just look past all of the people in Trump's administration who've come out against him. It's unprecedented in American history. These are people from his own party who worked with him up close on a daily basis. These are people he appointed. They know his temperament and his personality far more than the rest of us who only see him from afar. They know him better than the talking heads on TV. They're telling us that he's an authoritarian and that it's an incredible risk to give him an ounce of power. His own vice president has refused to endorse him. 

This should all be a big flashing warning sign. Instead, Trump supporters shrug it off and choose to believe a single source—Trump himself. A man who cheated on every wife he's ever had and defrauded a children's cancer charity. 

You're free to do that, of course. No one is going to stop you from placing all of your faith in one man. But you're going to have to get used to the idea of being lumped in with Donald Trump. The notion that the Republican Party is the home for tradition and values and patriotism and common decency has flown the coop. That became laughable when the party decided to stand behind Trump after January 6. 

There's a very good reason that many Republicans are choosing to abandon ship. You'll survive the next four years just fine without him in office. It's less clear whether the country can survive another four years with him as president. You don't have to vote for Harris. You can just leave that top spot blank. No one will ever know.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

There are millions of enraged and disgusted liberals who would be happy to vote for a legitimate green party candidate who doesn't work for Putin and who doesn't want to help get republicans elected.

"That’s not how it happened, Susan BA spent most of her life (starting at 16) as an abolitionist. She was very effective and passionate about it, often at her own peril. At a time when Abraham Lincoln was agreeing that African-Americans could be shipped back to Africa. She argued that they should be given access, equally, to all education and civil rights. She was the chief organizer recruiting and coordinating 2000 petition collectors who collected over 400000 signatures that helped push the 13th amendment through. She  fought for universal suffrage (blacks and women), and I might add the abolitionists pushing for suffrage decided to cut out half the African-Americans when they cut out women’s rights. They stabbed her in the back after years of working together; years of her, putting the abolitionist cause ahead of the women’s cause.They formed an anti-female suffrage committee and blocked most of the money for the cause. The 15th amendment which she opposed would not have given black women the right to vote. It only gave black men the right to vote.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Yup. I was there in 2016 too. It was crazy. I took my then 4-year-old daughter and took a picture in front of Suzie B.'s grave. Then we went home and the horror set in a few hours later. I used to like to say that picture documented the last time I was proud of my country. I hope I get to take a new picture this year to close this horrible chapter in history.,2024_11_03,05_39_45

It’s one thing to say it would’ve been too difficult to include black women in that time period because of the attitudes back then.

She wanted only white women to vote because she had I got mine shitty way of thinking,2024_11_03,05_39_45

Am I getting this right?",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"That's my point though, at the time there were more people than not that felt the same way as she did.  Not to say it's right, of course, just to say that was the mores of the day.


There's a scene in the movie Lincoln that shows this, a couple of people are brought in and asked how the felt about abolition, and they agreed that the slaves needed to be freed to win the civil war...but when pressed on whether they supported equal rights for those freed slaves, they immediately balked.


If all those people had taken the stance ""freedom without equal rights is pointless"" then slavery would have persisted.  I'm betting that women's suffrage would have suffered the same fate, had people taken the modern stance you espouse.


I'm not saying they're right or you're wrong, of course, I'm just saying that casting judgment on someone who existed hundreds of years before you did, based on the modalities of today, is a fools errand.  Context is important.  We can laud someone for being more progressive than others of their own time, even if they weren't progressive enough by today's standards.  If we can't, then we need to be prepared to be considered monsters in 200 years just the same and that just doesn't seem right to me.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

I see that she was a Quaker, a collector of anti slavery petitions at age 17 and 1856, she became the New York state agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society. (Via Wikipedia)

As I keep reading into this one article, I’ve come to believe you’ve got your facts askew. 

Susan Anthony lobbied very hard for most of her activist life for the rights of black people for full citizenship rights including the right to vote.   She worked along side abolitionists and other more forward thinking people at a time when it would have very unpopular to do so.

>For Trump, Tuesday is judgment day.

>“He branded himself as the guy who gets away with it,” said [Gwenda Blair](https://journalism.columbia.edu/directory/gwenda-linda-blair), a Trump biographer, adding that, should he lose, “he is facing a lot of moments of reckoning. He could go to jail. He could end up considerably less wealthy than he is*.* No matter what happens, and no matter whether he wins or loses, there will be a reckoning over his health. Death, ill health, dementia – those are things even he can’t escape.”

>The property developer and reality TV star has spent his career pushing ethical and legal boundaries to the limit, facing countless investigations, court battles and hefty fines. Worthy of a novel, his has been [a life of scandal on a gargantuan scale](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/trump-scandals.html).

>In the 1970s Trump and his father were sued by the justice department for [racial discrimination](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html) after refusing to rent apartments to Black people in predominantly white buildings. His property and casino businesses, including the Taj Mahal and Trump Plaza, filed for bankruptcy several times in the 1990s and early 2000s.

>[Trump University](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/06/trump-university-court-upholds-25m-settlement-to-give-students-money-back), a business offering property training courses, faced multiple lawsuits for fraud, misleading marketing and false claims about the quality of its programmes. In 2016 Trump settled for $25m without admitting wrongdoing.

>The Donald J Trump Foundation, a charitable organisation, was investigated and sued for allegedly using charitable funds for personal and business expenses. Trump eventually agreed to dissolve the foundation with remaining funds going to charity.

>Trump and his company were ordered to pay more than $350m in [a New York civil fraud trial](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/16/donald-trump-financial-fraud-case) for artificially inflating his net worth to secure favourable loan terms. He is also known to have paid little to no federal income taxes in specific years which, although technically legal, was seen by some as bordering on unethical.

>But Trump became a fixture of the New York tabloids and hosted his own reality TV show, [The Apprentice](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364782/). Blair added: “His early realisation was that if you get famous, if you get large, people will get out of the way. He spent the first part of his career as a real estate developer, making himself seem the embodiment of enormous tycoon-level success even though, in fact, many things he did weren’t successful and his father kept bailing him out.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"While I agree Trump has no place near the White House, I disagree that being a felon should disqualify you from office. 

First, it opens up a very real possibility of politically motivated charges and convictions to remove your opponents from running. Obviously, opponents can still be charged and convicted, but now can at least run again once out of prison. 

Secondly, we have to be hopeful that someone found guilty of a crime 20, 30, maybe 40 years ago has reformed and their record doesn’t reflect who they are now. Actually, the fact they served time, and experienced the other side of the legal system may bring a valuable perspective. Maybe they are running on a criminal justice reform platform. 

Ultimately, it should be up to the populace to decide if the criminal history is a positive, negative, or neutral factor in a candidate’s profile. And THAT is where WE’VE failed this time.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"It's a super tense and careful situation to manage.

Any action will look like an attack from MAGA's perspective, they're conditioned to it.

First, for the matter of fact, the news media and social media need to be reigned right the fuck in. News media needs to be neutered, it's one thing to claim free speech but it's another to do whatever the fuck this is. The integrity is non-existent and plays only to be a mouthpiece for the billionaire owners. National security should not be a sacrifice for profits. Then there's the factor of just the amount of wealth who have been supporting Trump. They've unionized themselves of course and have for decades. I figure they're holding that as security that they don't get targetted. But I don't think the nation will be satisfied until the super public facing ones are arrested.

Then what do you do to deal with the actual people? They have established themselves as terrorist organizations but they don't exist in a vacuum. They're well connected with police insiders, military connections. The only way to get rid of them is to blitz them in one foul swoop so not to trigger some kind of domino scenario.. But that's a nigh impossible task.

The world is watching too, of course. Much of what happens in America gets felt in ripples in other countries. There's an anticipation in the air, like, well what if Russia makes moves to incite something bigger in their disinformation agenda? They've already got plenty hooked. The war they started is being fought on the international battlefront right now via the internet.. It's looking really fucking bad right now because plenty of nations are contending with their own MAGA idiots too.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

">  I honestly did not see this coming at all, especially since it seems Iowa has been drifting away from Democrats in recent history.

Throw out all of our normal ideas about parties and candidates. Trump transcends Republican/Democrat enough that it's brand-new territory, even though this is his third time running. And Harris is transcending as well, e.g., losing support of Black men, gaining (some) support of white/Republican women. The whole thing is an election on psilocybin.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Yeah if Iowa is actually drifting away from Trump like this suggests it's likely not even going to be close overall.

Assuming you have an '18 level error, Trump ends up with +2 in Iowa- down from +8 in 2020 and +10 in 2016.

"While this is nice to see, let's do keep in mind:

Trump *did* win the white women vote both in 2016 and 2020, regardless of everything. Yeah, I don't know either. Of course, Trump now has to contend with the repeal of Roe v. Wade, which has hopefully turned enough white women against him that he can't rely on this category.

Thankfully, all other non-white women despise Trump as a whole and vote against him massively, particularly Black women. On a personal note, I'm gonna find it hilarious if GA goes blue *again* this year because of this; can't wait to see the ""Black Women Having To Save Our Sorry Asses *Again* memes.""",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"> Don't men care about women?

We are so far beyond that at this point. If they simply just ""didn't care"" and voted purely selfishly, on a ""what benefits *me* the most"" line of thinking? It's Harris by a landslide. It wouldn't even be close.

Here's the rub: if *women*, specifically white women, would also just vote on a purely selfish ""what benefits me the most"" line of thinking? It wouldn't matter what the white men did, it'd still be Harris, by a landslide. 

The numbers don't line up with this men don't care line of thinking. This is about *assholes* hating *everyone*, and a bunch of us trying to point out to the slower thinkers that ""hey, everyone means *you too*""",2024_11_03,05_39_45

But the gender split is the same as years past. So while more republicans are voting early, more men are not. Men are actually a couple points behind past years in PA.

The Heritage Foundation, who is about as biased in your direction as any outfit could possibly be, went back 40 years and found every single case of anything they could say was voter fraud and came up with a whopping 1560 cases. Hundreds and hundreds of millions of votes over dozens of elections and they came up 1560 cases, the vast majority of which were committed by US residents, the vast majority of which did not result in votes counted, none of which impacted any election’s outcome.

Trump was mad he didn’t win the popular vote in 2016 and claimed the 3.5 million votes Clinton beat him by were done by undocumented immigrants. He spent millions of taxpayer dollars on a commission to find evidence of fraud and they came up with jackshit and quietly disbanded.

Voter fraud happens every election but is rare, not organized and doesn’t account for even a drop in the bucket of total votes. There is no evidence at all that suggests our elections are not secure.

"Even though for my whole adult life (first voted in 2016) I have only known about the Trump era and cannot discernibly look back at other eras (perhaps a little bit of the Obama era in high school), I think Trump simply exposed a lot of rot that was hiding beneath the surface for a very long time. There is a particular affliction within this country that people conflate freedom of speech with freedom to believe any reality other than their own. That, combined with our material wealth, excess privilege, and our relative social isolation compared to many countries, allows for willful ignorance and paranoid stances on simple constructs of reality.

If you do look back at American History, this is a core tenet that drives much of our cultural 'traditions', and I think it gets exposed from time to time again. For example, the Civil War was fought over the idea of slavery (some regressives will tell you otherwise), which pro-slave advocates fought over the very nature of reality of this country and it's 'traditions'. Really we all can boil it down to self-serving principles lo and behold, but there have been many iterations of this channeling of willful ignorance that occur many more times in our history (Mccarthyism, weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the Jacksonian economic ideas, Prohibition, etc..)

Trumpism and the MAGA movement is only the latest form of that willful ignorance that is blind to how it damages the country. But as long as the people pushing the MAGA movement preserve the 'traditions' of what this country is about and stick it to the people that are driving us towards atheism and a multi-cultural and global society (aka elitists and liberals), they are psychologically more than okay with their moral hypocrisy and inconsistency within their own rhetoric. As long as they get to define freedom for the rest of their countrymen without consequence, as crazy as their views are, they really do think they are saving us from eternal damnation as a society. We can blame Russia all we want and other foreign actors such as China or Iran,.

"Wired Magazine had reporting on “Operation Doppelgänger”, a Russian influence campaign using Gaza as an issue to divide potential Harris support to help get Trump elected. 

On a logical level, it makes no sense at all to do anything that would help Trump get in office if you care about this issue. That includes sitting out the election. But knowing that being manipulated by this issue is part of Russia’s playbook to help Trump should be fucking insulting. They think you’re a stupid chump and you’re going to go along with it?

There's still no realistic alternative option, for either domestic or foreign policy for these groups.

I appreciate that they used the political capital they had to try and pressure democrats to do more. But if the only real alternative is antithetical to everything else you are and stand for, then that capital is just very limited. No way around that. And eventually, you have to play the strategy game just like the rest of us all are too.

These last two elections and this one I think really showcase how trapped we all are in the two party system and how difficult it will be to get out of as polarization increases (and asymmetrically with republicans running towards fascism). I think a lot of people are having trouble coming to terms with that in their lives.

"I fully agree, and personally I feel there is strong reason to hope. Right now I get people want concrete action, but she really has no power in the Biden administration and we know that man is beyond all reason on Israel, so how's she supposed to force him? Spike his coffee and start a coup? As for speaking out, I mean she's careful not to scare the boomers but has still been dropping not-so-subliminals *constantly* since Biden stepped down... it was literally the first thing she did, which is wild already, and she's only got more vocal since.

Remember when the party brass refused access for the Uncommitted Movement on Gaza during the DNC nomination, and also threw those hard Israeli Nationalists on stage as an extra fuck you? Kamala made damn clear that was a DNC choice, not her own, and that they don't get to speak for her new administration -- she personally invited the protest organizers to meet face-to-face, and lent her own voice to speak up on stage in their stead (they *still* declined her meeting, claiming it was just to buy their silence... but I think that's a drastic mis-read and lost opportunity, like a speech is nice but this woman is offering a private ear and working relationship with the hopefully-soon *most powerful person on the damn planet*). 

As for the DNC speeches themselves, the furthest left voices on that stage Bernie and AOC both gave just the bearest half-sentence of ""ceasefire & hostages please"",  but Kamala went on for fully 4 paragraphs -- like, that is a *choice*, she obviously cares... it wasn't all perfect, but damn sure she took pains on that stage to humanize Palestinian suffering in a way I don't think I've heard from a major politician *ever*. 

Remember, this election is already horrifically close without her alienating  90% of mass media along with the biggest most electorally engaged voting bloc in the nation (centrist boomers, sucks I know but somehow young leftists who mostly refuse to vote anyway didn't quite make the cut). And yet still she has constantly shown support in every way that isn't (arguably) political suicide... I really don't understand the expectation for her to spell this out for people any more obviously than she already has. 

For sure, having to read between the lines can be crazy-making, like interpreting tea leaves... but I can't really fault her playing strategically with the whole damn world at stake. Would I play everything the same in her position, hell no, but if we in the US refuse to even consider the one greatest ally we have on this (or possibly *ever will* have, if the other one gets in)...  well, to any voters reading, I don't think any of us get to wash our hands of this just because we chose to sit it out.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

The complete systematic and intentional destruction of civilian infrastructure, including the complete destruction of their healthcare system, educational institutions, and water and sanitation, along with blockades that have and are causing mass starvation, and forced displacement of most of the population, meets some definitions of genocide.

There is reasonable debate to be had about the specifics because there is not one solitary definition and it also requires some evaluation that is hard to do while the war is going on and third party access to Gaza is severely limited, but it is clearly close enough.

>Yes, based on that explanation you are using that word incorrectly lol. “Close enough” (in your opinion) doesn’t give you carte blanche to spew ugly misinfo unchallenged. You’re posting stupid nonsense online in a public forum, expect to get a response back.

I only said close enough to leave room for nuance. I believe it does meet the definition of genocide, as do many. Thanks for trying to use my attempt at being nuanced against me though.

>It’s wildly irresponsible to just lightly throw out a loaded word like “genocide”; all you’re doing is engaging in “Holocaust inversion” and attempting to justify the extreme actions of Islamist terrorists by fabricating a false narrative.

I am not lightly using this word and it's insane that you are accusing me of attempting to justify terrorism by calling out the complete destruction of an entire society. One atrocity does not justify another, especially one that is orders of magnitude larger in the scope of destruction and death.

>The primary reason infrastructure in Gaza has been hit so hard is because A) it’s a war and Gaza is small, and B) Hamas has been using civilian objects as military sites. According to international law, this means they are no longer civilian objects. I’m sorry that you don’t seem to understand this.

66% of infrastructure in Gaza is not being used as military sites. 100% of the Gazan healthcare system is not being used as military sites. And international law does not allow for the complete destruction of a society's infrastructure because some of it may be used by Hamas. You quote international law but then ignore the fact that the UN has accused Israel of committing crimes against humanity due to their attacks on infrastructure: [https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/10/un-commission-finds-war-crimes-and-crimes-against-humanity-israeli-attacks](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/10/un-commission-finds-war-crimes-and-crimes-against-humanity-israeli-attacks)

You can't have it both ways. Either you care about international law or you don't.

>Even so, Israel still warns civilians ahead of time with mass text alerts, roof knocks, and fliers w/ evac routes.

This doesn't do much good when so much of the infrastructure is destroyed that you reach a point that there is nowhere left to go.

>Additionally, 20% of Israel is Arab, many of whom are descended from these same people. Israel is not rounding these people up and exterminating them, further disproving your claim.

This is not a requirement to be considered genocide. The definition according to the Geneva Convention: *""In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:*

*Killing members of the group;*

*Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;*

*Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;*

*Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;*

*Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.""*

Note, it is any of the following with the intent to destroy the group in whole, or part.

It does not require the destruction of 100% of an ethnic group. What is happening in Gaza meets all these definitions except the last one. The intent can be established by many statements from those associated with or in the government itself, as well as various plans, both made public, such as the Generals Plan, and leaked, such as the concept plan to push Gazans into Egypt.

I'd also draw attention to this: [https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/edge-gaza-israeli-settlers-applaud-thud-artillery-fire](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/edge-gaza-israeli-settlers-applaud-thud-artillery-fire)

>Every war in existence is a “humanitarian crisis” btw, but no, the famine rumor has already been debunked. COGAT delivers aid every day, Hamas just pilfers it.

""Trust me bro"". The United States, who has been the closest partner of Israel during this, sent a letter accusing them of blocking aid, and this is not the first time. So are they lying then? Is everyone lying but Israel?

>The blockades exist because since Day 1, Hamas has sworn to destroy Israel, and has fired rockets and incendiary balloons over the border to accomplish this goal, while brainwashing their citizenry into militants for the past 18 years. Plz read an actual book. My god, man.

Yes, illegal blockades have existed prior to the war, you are correct. The blockades imposed during the war have been even worse.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"Murdoch will be dead soon enough from old age, and I believe his kids are naturalized.

Melania, even as first lady, was pretty pointless because she never wanted the job.

Musk is a problem though.  His ownership of SpaceX puts him at the center of some serious National Security infrastructure.

"Interesting thought.  If Biden were to use the wartime powers act, I think he could nationalize SpaceX, revoke Musk's citizenship, and deport him.

I wonder if there are reasonable ways for him to shut down Twitter as well under his ""core responsibilities.""  I'd actually love to see Twitter become a non-profit and go back to what it was, so maybe he could combine it with NPR?

Sadly, I'm sure Biden won't do any of this, but it would definitely make the world a better place on his way out :(",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"He still have his security clearance, and is the CEO of the company.  He doesn't do much on the engineering side of the house, but he's the one that (working from memory) first wanted to charge the US for operating starlink over Ukraine, then is accused of regularly cut off starlink access in specific portions of Ukraine and Russia.  For accuracy, I know one of the reports of him turning it off turned out to be false, he just wouldn't extent coverage over Crimea - ironically claiming US sanction if I remember.

Recent rumors are that he also was asked by China through Putin to not provide Starlink coverage to Taiwan.

So while he's not doing the micro stuff, he is still directing US policy on the Macro level.

On the issue of immigration law, I don't think that's been proven one way or the other yet - just accused.

What I'd been more interested is if you could strip him of his US citizenship and force him to sell off some of his US properties like we are maybe doing with TikTok.

If he's kicked out, you could also argue Twitter would be in the same situation as TikTok.

So, I'll be surprised if he faced any consequences, but there are certainly some fun things that could be done to him if anyone has the balls :P",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"I find it hard to believe the US didn't know about these already, but was, for whatever reason, quietly ignoring them.

Still, there is a massive double standard here.  If I so much get a contact high from someone smoking pot, I would have lost my security access (contractor back in the day) and be barred from military facilities (for whatever reason, they *really* don't like marihuana at the federal level).

And what does musk do?  Likes up a big one on a broadcast podcast with Rogan!

Again, at best, I would have gotten a review and a reprimand (never mind the doing it in public part), but I'm pretty sure my Security Clearance would have been struck and I would have been standing outside before I could blink, and probably still wouldn't be let onto any military facility today.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"I think it comes down to that he's been shielded from his crimes by the corporations taking the fine/charge.  The only other one I'm aware of is his smoking weed with Rogan, which would lose anyone else their clearance on the spot, but apparently we as a country decided to ignore that.

Now, having conversations with ""friends"" in Russia is not illegal, when your ""friend"" is the leader of a country that is very much hostile to the US, that's one hell of a red flag.  My hope is that the CIA was aware of and monitoring these calls, but if not, the nature of these calls needs to be immediately investigated, and that is where I think something that could affect Musk personally (as opposed to being able to hide behind his businesses) could be uncovered.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Unfortunately, I don't think it can.  The Government can exercise eminent domain on property and equipment, and the can use the defense production act to tell you what to make, but they can't actually strip you of your ownership.

If there was specific criminal cause, I think they could kick you out as CEO, kind of like how Trump is no longer allowed to do business in NY, but other than fines, Musk would still own SpaceX.

However, that's general law.  The US essentially created the TSA by nationalizing airport security industry, and there's been multiple cases where companies have been at least partially or temporarily nationalized after bankruptcy (the most recent being the bank and auto industry rescues done by Obama.

With SpaceX's current status I don't think either of these options are valid though :(

What you need is to actually catch him handing off US secure documents to the Russians or the Chinese.  That's about the only thing I can think of that would outright break him loose from SpaceX, and as much as I'd love to see him gone, I honestly hope he's not trading US tech secrets :(",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"I think if you found out he'd been selling secrets, or otherwise compromising national security, it would give you the ground to prevent him from doing business in the US, or exercising his shareholder rights.  The company would be put under stewardship until next steps were decided.  This is basically what has happened to Trump in NY.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

It has always been illegal to enter the US on one type of VISA when you intend to do something else.  Musk entered on a Student VISA which requires you to be enrolled in a US school.  He never enrolled nor attended University.  Thus he stayed in the US illegally.

"According to the courts, he doesn't need justification.  He can just say our stockpiles are lower than they should be, and as commander and chief, I'm taking over the assembly line.

But it's really broad, as Biden invoked it for clean energy technologies, I believe based on a report that Global Warming needed to be considered a National Security issue.

And both Biden and Trump used it during Covid. Trump used it to crack down on hoarding, limit exports of medical goods, and increase production of ventilators and other supplies. Biden used it to speed up vaccination and testing efforts.

So you don't even need an active war, just something that you can claim is connected to National Defense, and it becomes a very flexible little tool.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"To be fair, *especially* if Trump wins, I hope Biden just goes whole hog - let Ukraine off the hook - start actually investigating Israeli war crimes . . . all sorts of fun things.

"I will track down the relevant sources for you. He was on a J-1 Visa.  He got a bachelors then was accepted into Stanford but never attended. He stayed on a J-1 Student VISA which he then has claimed was turned into an H-1B VISA.  He claimed that it was the way it works but that is not how it works. H-1B VISA's are temporary work permits which require a sponsor.  Legally speaking he could not sponsor himself.  Being in the US on a J-1 VISA would have required him to leave the US when he was no longer enrolled in a school, then have a sponsor give him an H-1B VISA to return to the US.  Legally speaking he could not found a company in the US on a J-1 VISA. 

>The visa allows temporary entry into the United States to participate in an exchange program.
>J-1 visa holders are authorized to work if they enter the U.S. as part of an exchange program that specifically authorizes working in a certain industry or profession.
>Spouses and children of exchange program participants may be entitled to the J-2 classification and employment visas, although their income must not be used to support the J-1 holder’s participation in the program.

Legally speaking he was also required by law to admit to whether or not he stayed in the US at any point illegally before he could become naturalized. 

We have documentation that his board of directors knew of his illegal status and there were meetings about the subject and what to do about it. We have documentation that he did not disclose those as he was legally required to do upon application to be a US citizen. 

In the 1990's they did not enforce those rules as often.  However, considering the rhetoric from the people demanding that everyone follow those laws, you would think that Elon Musk's own status would be an issue and that he should be held to the exact same standard that he is publicly insisting others be held to. 

He's an immigrant, who doesn't seem to want to integrate, instead he wants to turn the US into South Africa.

I do think that Republicans and their sponsors have no idea what actual consequences are and likely won't understand it until Democrats stop trying to placate the zealots. It would be karmic justice if Democrats started to use the actual laws equally and I would love to see Elon Musk denaturalized for breaking the immigration laws and his attempts to overthrow democratically elected governments.

"Republicans and anyone who votes Republican hates women. You’re anti-woman, it’s sad. You prove it over and over again. There is no “pro-life”, only anti-woman baloney. 

People who actually care about life work tirelessly to pass legislation for gun control while Republicans and their voters actively vote against it. Why would a “pro-lifer” like to see children slain in schools when it would be so easy to make any effort towards preventing it? Because they don’t care about life, they’re anti-woman and anti-child. 

Why do they defend gun rights so bad? Oh right, for that grotesque, sociopathic fantasy of murdering people with guns. “Walk into my house and I’ll shoot you!” Good one, “pro-lifers”. Shout louder and louder about how you only care about life when it’s in a woman, because you’re anti-woman. 

Who was on the Capitol lawn chanting “Hang Mike Pence!” almost four years ago? Those are your “pro-lifers” once again fantasizing about murder because they’re sociopathic freaks who hate women and love killing. 

Women now can’t get proper health care when they’re pregnant and we see high infant mortality and high death rates in pregnant women. Because republicans are so, so “pro-life” but only when it comes to controlling women. They’re anti-women. 

Weird that pro-lifers also desperately hate immigrants and wish their death often. Anti-woman, murder-obsessed losers. 

Y’all love “back the blue” when they’re in the streets murdering people. Anti-woman, sociopathic murderers. You don’t care about life one bit. 

Republican Speaker of the House just announced he wants to remove CHIPS, an act that serves only to help children. Very pro-life to remove assistance for the life you claim to protect.

The depiction of metal wire hangers happened for good reasons, too many women died or did so much damage to their reproductive organs that they could never have children.

We have already seen too many women in Texas be denied a medically necessary abortion which would not just save their lives but would allow them to have the additional child/children they want. We have seen at least 2 women from Georgia and one (or more) in Texas die due to the way the laws have been written as to be so evasive that doctors fear for their careers and livelihood not to mention the health of their patients.

Of course women of my age and older remember what happened prior to Roe v. Wade. We were the ones celebrating our victory in 1973. May of us were on the protest lines again, we were the ones with the signs indicating our need to protest again to keep our right to self determination.

I mean his Trump bibles are made in China so….at least he’s consistent?,2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Article:

On the campaign trail, Donald Trump threatened businesses that send jobs south of the border, while his own company that runs the Truth Social platform outsourced coding jobs to workers in Mexico, outraging some staff members. 

Former President Donald Trump’s social media company outsourced jobs to workers in Mexico even as Trump publicly railed against outsourcing on the campaign trail and threatened heavy tariffs on companies that send jobs south of the border.

The firm’s use of workers in Mexico was confirmed by a spokesperson for Trump Media, which operates the Truth Social platform. The workers were hired through another entity to code and perform other technical duties, according to a person with knowledge of Trump Media. The reliance on foreign labor was met with outrage among the company's own staff, who accused its leadership of betraying their “America First” ideals, the person said.

The outsourcing to Mexico helped prompt a recent whistleblower letter from staff to Trump Media’s board that has been roiling the company.

That complaint, reported by ProPublica last month, calls for the board to fire CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman. The letter alleges he has “severely” mismanaged the company. It also asserts the company is hiring “America Last” — with Nunes imposing a directive to hire only foreign contractors at the expense of “American workers who are deeply committed to our mission.”

“This approach not only contradicts the America First principles we stand for but also raises concerns about the quality, dedication, and alignment of our workforce with our core values,” the complaint reads.

A Trump Media spokesperson said the company uses “two individual workers” in Mexico. “Presenting the fact that [Trump Media] works with precisely two specialist contractors in Mexico as some sort of sensational scandal is just the latest in a long line of defamatory conspiracy theories invented by the serial fabricators at ProPublica,” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson declined to answer other questions about the company’s Mexican contractors, including how much they’ve been paid, how many have been used over time and how their hiring squares with Trump’s promises to punish firms that send jobs outside of the U.S. The Trump campaign did not respond to questions.

For a company of its prominence, Trump Media has a tiny permanent staff, employing just a few dozen people as of the end of last year, only a portion of whom work on the Truth Social technology.

Trump Media’s hiring of Mexican coders also prompted frustration within the staff, the person with knowledge of the company said, because they were perceived by staff to not have the technical expertise to do the work.

On its homepage, Truth Social bills itself as “Proudly made in the United States of America. 🇺🇸”

Both as president and in his campaign for a second term, Trump has criticized companies that send jobs abroad, particularly to Mexico. If elected, he has pledged to “stop outsourcing” and “punish” companies that send jobs abroad.

For example, Trump recently threatened agricultural machinery giant John Deere with tariffs if it went through with plans to move some of its manufacturing to Mexico.

“I’m just notifying John Deere right now, if you do that, we’re putting a 200 percent tariff on everything you want to sell into the United States,” Trump said.

He has made a similar threat against automakers building cars in Mexico, demanding they hire American workers and manufacture domestically. 

“I'm not going to let them build a factory right across the border,” Trump promised, “and sell millions of cars into the United States and destroy Detroit further.""

Trump owns nearly 60% of the social media company, a stake worth around $3.5 billion at the stock’s Friday closing price — more than half of the former president’s net worth.

The results of the election are widely seen as a major factor in the future value of the company. As the Nov. 5 election draws closer, Trump Media’s stock price has fluctuated wildly even as little or nothing has changed in the company’s actual business, which generates scant revenue. The stock closed Friday down 40% from its recent peak on Tuesday. Despite that drop, it has still nearly doubled since the beginning of October.

One Trump Media board member, Eric Swider, offered a defense of relying on foreign labor in a statement to ProPublica from his lawyer.

“President Trump maintains an America First policy, which includes prioritizing American workers. Trump Media, however, is a global multi-media company. For a global multi-media company to utilize subcontractors, which in turn may utilize coders located in a foreign country, is a practice common to the industry,” the statement said. “Such global multi-media companies like Trump Media would have no right to control the employment decisions of its subcontractors, which may employ workers in a multitude of different countries in addition to the United States.”

Swider, a businessman based in Puerto Rico, serves on the board alongside better known figures such as Donald Trump Jr. and Linda McMahon, the former Trump cabinet member who is now co-chair of his transition team.

The outsourcing to Mexico is not the only instance of Trump Media relying on foreign workers. ProPublica previously reported that the company used a foreign firm to source labor in the Balkans.

Nunes, for his part, is quoted in a new book about Truth Social, “Disappearing the President,” boasting about his ability to keep costs down at Trump Media, though he didn’t mention outsourcing.

“Nobody grew as fast as we did. I don't think there's any other example even close to us out there, especially with as little money as we spent,” Nunes said. “Don't forget that. We built this for a fraction of what these other companies were built for.”",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"I worked at a year-round Christmas decoration/ornament/etc. store during Trump's first real run for President for 2016. During this time we started (at some point) receiving regular shipments of Trump's MAGA red-hat as a Christmas ornament. We got **boxes upon boxes upon boxes** of these stupid things. 

Anyway, the reason I bring this up is because the boxes that these ornaments came in states (in very thick, bold lettering) ""Make America Great Again"" **right next to much smaller font that says ""made in China"".**

So there's a family in the store browsing and whatnot. I mean they were super friendly and caused absolutely no issues or anything so I was chill with em, but I did note something absolutely asinine that the father said about the Trump ornaments:

""HAH! damn right Make America Great Again"", he said to his family all in tow. *I didn't even jump in whatsoever on the conversation and the dad* ***then*** says (after seeing ""made in China"" for the first time on the lanyard part):

Pollsters assume the past holds true, but in 2016 Trump activated a bunch of racists and edgelords that don't normally vote, and Hillary's campaign deactivated reliable voters who thought Hillary had it in the bag and didn't need to vote.  IMO 2016 was a once-in-a-generation election.  2020 was Covid, which made things different and difficult.

Here in 2024, Trump is no longer the edgelord candidate and Harris is running a much better campaign than Hillary, but pollsters are assuming Trump generates the enthusiasm he did 8 years ago and Harris underperforms like Clinton.  We'll see what happens this Tuesday.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"TL;DR 

- Trump outperformed the polls in 2016 and 2020. 

- Pollsters are afraid that if Trump outperforms the polls again, they are going to lose all credibility. 

- Some pollsters are likely discarding pro-Harris poll results, or applying some heavy filtering / weighting to make the polls seem more pro-Trump, to account for the previous ""outperformance"" results. 

So basically pollsters are putting their finger on the scale in Trumps favor, to cover their asses in case Trump actually performs well. 

Problem is that if Harris does very well, neither democrats or republicans will ever trust the polls again.

In any case, get ready for Trump to raise hell. He'll point to the polls to claim election fraud - mark my words.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"I read an article written by a poll expert. I wish I had saved it so I could cite the source. Anyway, he said the higher the turnout the less accurate the polls are because they are based on past elections and with this election having an exceptionally large number of first time voters that makes it even more challenging to predict. So, we can’t know based on the polls. 
Here’s what has me cautiously optimistic. 1. The enthusiasm is high among the democrats and that is spreading to independents and other “undecided” voters. 2. Early numbers are showing that democrats are turning out in big numbers and rumors are MAGA is getting nervous. 3. And most important, WOMEN! Dobbs changed the game completely. We are angry and we are motivated. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE US. I think EVERYONE has been underestimating women from the moment Dobbs came out. The media, the politicians, the pollsters, everyone. We have not forgotten and we are serious about not going back. Kamala understands that and has tapped into it. And women vote. It wasn’t that long ago that we couldn’t.

"Apart from the polls, are there any other indicators in favor for Trump? 

In 2016, Trump ran a good campaign. It was strategic (exploiting Facebook before anyone else did) and buoyed by a confluence of historical factors that can’t be repeated (30 years of rightwing smears vs decades of him as a celebrity businessman/political outsider). And that’s the only election he’s won.

This time, there’s loads of factors against him that weren’t present in 2020: January 6th, disproportionate Republican Covid deaths, Dobbs, his felony conviction, his age. He has loads of his own party endorsing his opponent. What does his ground game look like? Anything like 2016?

In order for him to win, he has to have such a groundswell of support from voters that overcomes such traditional measures like endorsements or a good ground game. Basically, all theory of what makes a successful campaign needs to be wrong (Like prior to today, if I told you the polls were razor thin and one of the candidates pretended to suck a microphone like it was a dick at a rally, would you say they were going to win?)

Trump squeaked out a victory in 2016, never had more than 49% approval his entire term, and then lost re-election. Kamala’s run a great campaign (legitimately fantastic given the circumstances and time constraint) with no major missteps. If the polls are accurate and the race is close, what is actually tipping it toward Trump? Can anyone explain that to me?",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"My theory is that polls aren't capturing the non voters who are turning out in large numbers.  Pollsters always work off of voter registration databases from previous elections.
  
They've already seen more brand new voters in Pennsylvania than the margin of the 2016 victory.  There are like 100K voters who came from the 40% of the population that doesn't vote.
  
There are millions of people coming out to vote who I don't think are being captured by polls.

Example of delusional scenario for reference :  There was a story the other day about Harris panicking on a hot mic after a normal interview, then literally the same day there is another story about Biden + Obama in another hot mic situation talking trash about her.  The way conservatives gobbled up that obvious nonsense feels… desperate I guess.  But it’s not translating into actual real world enthusiasm nearly as much as previous elections.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

">Hillary’s campaign deactivated reliable voters who thought Hillary had it in the bag and didn’t need to vote

Maybe it’s regional, but I don’t remember this about 2016 AT ALL. Nobody I knew thought she had it in the bag. Even people who were hopeful were nervous. Who are these people who supposedly sat out because they were THAT confident?

What actually happened: HRC was a terrible candidate. Not on her own merits - she is a fantastically accomplished person with tons of experience. BUT

HRC had been vilified **for years** already before her candidacy even started. Anyone who spends time with Rs knows how they lied and lied and lied about Benghazi. Plenty of non-Rs believed those lies. There were tons of other lies too - remember the pizza shop that was supposedly running a child sex trafficking ring from its supposed basement? Total lies about her, about SO many things. Plus she’s obviously linked to Bill, which means she was linked to his baggage also. And then there were the emails. And THEN Comey dropped his last minute “Let me announce that we’re investigating her (which came to nothing, of course) but not announce that we’re also investigating the other main candidate too.”

The vast majority of people didn’t stay home because they were super confident. They stayed home because she was unlikeable candidate who’d been investigated multiple times and was now being investigated again for something else. “Where there’s smoke there’s fire” is basically the idea behind why people didn’t want to vote for her. Not because they were so sure she’d win - because the general population didn’t particularly like her to start and she couldn’t overcome that.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"The real test will be to see how motivating those issues are, and how resistant they are to any other factors. They’re only the top issues because of their importance to Republican voters (66% of R/lean-R vs 36% of D/lean-D), and I don’t know why those issues in particular would be any more motivating than whatever the top issues of prior elections were. 

I’d even argue that it will hurt get-out-the-vote. The last time the economy was the top issue was 2008, when there was a major financial crash right before the election. This time, despite voter’s perceptions, the US economy is doing great. Again, while voter’s perceptions differ, there isn’t a specific economic shock like a market crash or price spike that I think would increase votes for those whom it’s the top issue (as opposed to how recent news stories of a pregnant teen dying in Texas because of the abortion laws might if abortion is your top issue).

Furthermore, those are top issues based on polling responses, the same polling responses that show a 50/50 race. They may be the top issues, but they’re not giving Trump a clear edge. To push Trump over the top, he needs independents, undecideds, new voters, and unlikely voters. It’s true that Trump does better with low-propensity voters, but that was true of 2020, the election he lost. 

To win, he both needs those kinds of voters and for Harris to *not* get a boost from those same kinds of voters. Trump needs to get all the votes he got in 2020 or more and Harris needs to lose Biden’s margin and not make it up anywhere. People will point to the relatively small number of like 50,000 votes spread across a couple swing states that did for Biden as the reason for Trump having a chance. *But he still needs to get those votes.* There’s few things that you can point to that have happened since 2020 that suggest Trump would get more votes and relatively little that suggests Harris wouldn’t get Biden’s levels. 

I feel like I’m just going through some self-therapy right now but when the polls seem to be disconnected from all the other factors in a race, history suggests it’s the polls that are wrong.

ETA: My tl;dr is that if you look at solely since Biden dropped out, Trump has run the worst campaign that he’s ran and Harris has run the best of the Dems since 2016, and for Trump to win, that reality needs to have zero effect on the campaigns.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

we will know if another mass event is expected because the organizing will be out in the open, but it will require a few weeks to generate hype for a high turnout at a decided location. probably not in DC again as the whole downtown is already reinforcing buildings in preparation; the capitol building itself i’m sure will be entirely closed off during the certification.

when the election is called for kamala, i can totally imagine trump responding with: “they’re doing it again. head to your own state capitol on 1/6/25 and take your state back”. so mobs of various sizes make a big trumpy display at their state capitols. maybe some locations with sympathetic capitol police units simply invite the mobs in. maybe super contested locations like Pennsylvania and Georgia descend into all-out violence. however, with what tangible goal, i wonder.
whatever chaos ensues is not likely to change the fact that he’s been officially been blocked from office or that he must now face the consequences of the life he has lived. unless the supreme court literally hands him the presidency his goose is cooked. and if scrotus tries to pull something like that, there are clearly enough americans willing to mobilize to protect their rights to cause civil breakdown. the gop has not generated near enough hype this cycle to justify false claims in the eyes of the majority. 

idk, whatever happens there will still be tons more work to do to protect our institutions from the federalists and heritage societies. but i have hope even through my shot-to-hell nerves that we will get the leg up we need this go round.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

">For good reason, these stories show the incredibly cruelty of these bans.

Yes, and also how far-reaching their impact is. The right tries to portray sexual assault, miscarriage, and medically complex pregnancy as rare, but they're really not. It used to be rare to *talk* about them, but it's not the 1950s anymore. We are not letting them shame us anymore. Fuck ""politeness."" The more stories we share, the more apparent it becomes that most women have experienced one or more of these situations, or know someone who has. 

I've posted about this elsewhere, but in 2020 I was diagnosed with cancer when I was 15w pregnant. Laws protecting access to abortion saved my life, *and the life of my unborn baby*, because it meant that my care team could use their medical judgment freely and provide me with life-saving treatment without fear of criminal prosecution if I happened to miscarry. (And given that I'd had FIVE miscarriages prior to this pregnancy, that was not an unlikely outcome regardless of my cancer treatments.)

"If you’ve ever had a miscarriage, it can be an extremely painful event. You get cramps, you get contractions, and you bleed. if it’s an incomplete miscarriage, there is a high chance of sepsis. If it’s ectopic and you don’t get help because the foetus still has a heartbeat, you’re likely to lose the fallopian tube and ovary, which can cause you to bleed out and die.

The pain alone should be managed at a hospital. The emotional pain you feel for losing a wanted child is nothing to be scoffed at. Not prescribing proper pain medication while undergoing something as physically and mentally painful as a miscarriage - especially a later miscarriage - is inhumane.

I hope that if there is a single benefit to come out of all of this, it’s that women and girls finally get the acknowledgement for how painful and difficult these situations are. An Advil and a Tylenol and going home isn’t enough, and they would not do this to men in an equal amount of pain.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"For those wondering about what really happen and how this conspiracy originated:

The belief that vaccines might cause autism can be traced back to a now-discredited study published in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield, a former British physician. Wakefield and 12 co-authors published a paper in The Lancet that suggested a potential link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. The study claimed that 12 children who received the MMR vaccine showed developmental regression and gastrointestinal issues. This controversial claim generated widespread public concern and spurred significant media attention, fueling fears about the safety of vaccines.

However, the study was quickly scrutinized for its flaws. First, it was based on an extremely small sample size of just 12 children, which was statistically inadequate to draw reliable conclusions. The study also lacked control groups, a fundamental aspect of rigorous scientific research. Further investigations revealed even more troubling details: Wakefield had undisclosed conflicts of interest, including being funded by lawyers pursuing lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers. Additionally, he had filed a patent for a separate vaccine, raising questions about his motives in discrediting the MMR vaccine.

Subsequent independent investigations were conducted to verify the claims made in the 1998 paper. Large-scale studies consistently found no link between vaccines and autism. For instance, a major cohort study conducted in Denmark, involving over 500,000 children, showed that the MMR vaccine did not increase the risk of autism. Other studies conducted by prominent health organizations, including the CDC and the WHO, reaffirmed these findings, establishing that vaccines do not cause autism.

The repercussions for Wakefield were severe. In 2010, The Lancet formally retracted the 1998 paper, citing ethical violations and false information. The GMC in the UK conducted an extensive investigation, concluding that Wakefield had engaged in professional misconduct, including dishonesty and the unethical treatment of children. As a result, Wakefield’s medical license was revoked, effectively barring him from practicing medicine in the UK. He was widely discredited in the scientific community and faced significant public criticism for promoting misleading information that contributed to widespread vaccine hesitancy.

This discredited study had lasting consequences, sparking a wave of vaccine fear that persists in some communities today. Public health experts have continued to emphasize that the original claims were fraudulent and that comprehensive research has shown vaccines to be safe and unrelated to autism. Despite the overwhelming evidence, the legacy of Wakefield’s disinformation has underscored the importance of maintaining trust in scientific rigor and ensuring that conflicts of interest are transparent in medical research.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

That said, we can’t sit on our hands and do nothing. We’re not indifferent to the consequences of rampant ignorance. To address that, I’d personally rather increase legal liability for those that spread the misinformation through commercial channels. Make someone substantiate claims or be obligated to fund the same airtime for an independently gathered opposing perspective.

If we can’t get money out of politics, we at least have to reduce the ROI for bad actors to take advantage of the loophole. Requiring real debate - facts and/or opposing perspective - feels like the most obvious way to incentivize this.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"I dispute none of what you wrote. I don't remember the details of Wakefield's fraud, only that it was fraud from the start.

[The British Medical Journal](https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452):
>The Office of Research Integrity in the United States defines fraud as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism. [Journalist Brian] Deer unearthed clear evidence of falsification. He found that not one of the 12 cases reported in the 1998 Lancet paper was free of misrepresentation or undisclosed alteration, and that in no single case could the medical records be fully reconciled with the descriptions, diagnoses, or histories published in the journal.

>Who perpetrated this fraud? There is no doubt that it was Wakefield. Is it possible that he was wrong, but not dishonest: that he was so incompetent that he was unable to fairly describe the project, or to report even one of the 12 children’s cases accurately? No. A great deal of thought and effort must have gone into drafting the paper to achieve the results he wanted: the discrepancies all led in one direction; misreporting was gross. Moreover, although the scale of the [UK General Medical Council's] 217 day hearing precluded additional charges focused directly on the fraud, the panel found him guilty of dishonesty concerning the study’s admissions criteria, its funding by the Legal Aid Board, and his statements about it afterwards.

Edit: A better summary paragraph, *ibid*.
>[J]ournalist Brian Deer now shows the extent of Wakefield’s fraud and how it was perpetrated (doi:10.1136/bmj.c5347). Drawing on interviews, documents, and data made public at the GMC hearings, Deer shows how Wakefield altered numerous facts about the patients’ medical histories in order to support his claim to have identified a new syndrome; how his institution, the Royal Free Hospital and Medical School in London, supported him as he sought to exploit the ensuing MMR scare for financial gain; and how key players failed to investigate thoroughly in the public interest when Deer first raised his concerns.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

The maternal mortality rate in Texas  increased *56%* from 2019-2022. 

THESE ARE PREVENTABLE DEATHS!

"Texas doctors are afraid of jail time. Texas made it a crime punishable with up to LIFE IN PRISON to perform an abortion. This is why ERs are turning away patients miscarrying if the fetus still has a heartbeat. The law ties doctor's hands, and they have to wait until the fetus dies before treating the woman.

Abortion bans prioritize the fetus life (even if unviable) over the woman's life. Trump, Cruz, Abbot, and Paxton have blood on their hands.

Ken Paxton has sued to ensure that emergency rooms DO NOT save women's lives. FTA: ""Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has successfully made his state the only one in the country that isn’t required to follow the Biden administration’s efforts to ensure that emergency departments don’t turn away patients like Crain."" 

Ken Paxton is even suing for access to women's medical records in other states so he can prosecute women for leaving Texas to have an abortion in another state! 

And Texas is now facing a decline in ob/gyn doctors so ALL women's health care is suffering.

And when they started their training they probably didn’t think they’d have to decide between a patient or potentially life in jail.
While I think a jury wouldn’t convict, AGs in red states, especially TX, have shown they will pursue charges readily.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

The doctors were waiting to be sure the fetus was dead (to avoid liability) before treating the woman. ""...on Crain’s third hospital visit, an obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to “confirm fetal demise,” a nurse wrote, before moving her to intensive care."" 

Also from the article: ""if the infection had gone too far, ending the pregnancy might have been necessary to save Crain.""

""In states with abortion bans, such patients are sometimes bounced between hospitals like “hot potatoes,” with health care providers reluctant to participate in treatment that could attract a prosecutor, doctors told ProPublica.""

""Texas’s abortion ban threatens prison time for interventions that end a fetal heartbeat, whether the pregnancy is wanted or not.""

""There is a federal law to prevent emergency room doctors from withholding lifesaving care. No state has done more to fight this interpretation than Texas, which has warned doctors that its abortion ban supersedes the administration’s guidance on federal law, and that they can face up to 99 years in prison for violating it.""",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Heave Ho!,2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Yes. early in-person is higher than early in-person in 2020. BUT 2020 was a very different year for early voting. Because almost everyone who could vote by mail chose to vote by mail. SO, the total number of pre-election-day votes is lagging 2020 by quite a lot in most places, when you count the fact that way less mail in votes are being handled this year. 


BUT I also think this is a procedural advantage for Dems. One of Republicans main voter suppression tactics is the selective mail ballot screening bullshit. In blue counties, they install mail in voting judges who reject as many ballots as possible for any fault or inconsistency they can. Even as trivial as illegible signature, or missing a piece of tape or whatever the asinine requirement they put on it. But in the red counties, they somehow don't get the same level of scrutiny. And some states also say you can't start counting mail in ballots until election day, so less mail in means faster results and less chance for a Florida 2000 situation where SCOTUS can stop the clock. SO, a lower percentage of mail in votes also means a smaller chance of voter suppression by Republicans. And since it was more likely to be Democratic voters who were ""afraid"" to vote in person because of COVID, and vote by mail instead in 2020, this change almost certainly benefits Democrats to some degree overall. ",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"voting in Kentucky should matter, you said it yourself, you live in a purple town. Getting people you want into office in your local elections or even in US House races is still super significant.

Case in point, I am in Minnesota, Minnesota has a few super swingy electoral districts in the suburbs of the twin cities. That matters because maybe we'll send an extra democrat to congress, or an extra republican. Also our state legislature could possibly go from DFL to Republican. That's a BIG deal because Minnesota's made big news headlines because of Tim Walz and our DFL legislature, things like free school lunches and being a trans refuge (and also our progress on indigenous tribal issues and the environment).

regardless of the presidential race, it really matters a LOT who controls your local legislature and who your state sends to congress, and again look at the 538 polls. In states where it's a toss up for the presidential race, there's still a HUGE margin of difference between democratic and republican congressional candidates. Ohio might swing strongly for Trump, but Democrat Sherrod Brown is leading in the Senate race.

> &quot;Part of FHWA&#039;s core mission is to connect communities, which includes the 22 bridge projects we&#039;re funding across America under our bridge investment program,&quot; said Acting Federal Highway Administrator Kristin White.

> To date, the Bridge Investment Program has invested $8.1 billion into 100 bridge projects in 44 states across the country, and an additional $21 billion in dedicated bridge formula funds - the full amount provided by BIL over 2022-2025 - has been distributed to states.

Like seriously, it’s 22 bridges for 600 Million.

Edit: I looked again, these are small-medium  bridges being fixed so 1.2 Trillion is a very low estimate. I wouldn’t be surprised if it were 2 trillion. 


And that’s just the bridges, the rest of the roads are need fixed as well.

So we can have a 6 lane road that we don’t need instead of a 4 lane road that we also don’t  actually need?

And we don’t need to fix them to make them safe, the bridge 2 miles from me that has been out for 10 years is safe.  Can’t get hurt if the bridge is closed.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Yes, better roads, that doesn’t mean more lanes. That doesn’t mean speeding 200 million on a new over pass alignment so people don’t have to slow down for 15 seconds.


Sure better roads can mean cheaper products.
It can also mean like above, spending 200 Million to save a penny here or there. 


You can’t just build or upgrade a road anywhere for an ‘economy boost’. It has to be in the right place, where there is actually need. 


I’m not against better roads, or fixing the roads, or increasing funding for roads. I want all of
These things. 


But you know how everyone always complains about how the government could do better and there should be more accountability. Not with roads, Nobody gives a shit. The DOT does whatever it wants and your all like, well obviously they made the correct choice, and there is no way that the same service could have been provided in a slightly different way at a significantly reduced cost. But nah fuck that, we don’t want no financial accountability. Why wouldn’t the DOT be perfect. Just like the Military whose finical record is known to be impeccable.  


It boggles the mind.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
You do realize this is the exact shit the “funding you are for” is needed for? Rehabbing our outdated failing infrastructure. What do you think it should be used for? If a bridge is in critical condition nearing failure should we fix it?,2024_11_03,05_39_45
"Not all of them, some of them should just be closed down, or maybe rebuilt smaller.


Like I said, I’m not against fixing our bridges or funding them. But you tell me where the political will to quadruple the gas tax is? Or toll highways? 


And if we aren’t gonna raise taxes to fund the roads we have then we can’t afford to fix them all and build more.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"WTF bad is going to happen? If you’re concerned about Election Day, the reality is that there’s a long-standing tradition of millions voting without issues on that day. For more than a century, the U.S. has managed Election Day in person, even through major historical events, from wars to natural disasters. Most voters are able to cast their ballots without disruption, and polling places are well-prepared to handle emergencies or unexpected events that could come up.

Suggesting that “Something Bad” might happen on Election Day is fear-based and implies a worst-case scenario that, statistically, rarely impacts voters. It’s understandable that campaigns want to lock in votes early, but scaring people into early voting by assuming hypothetical dangers is unproductive. For voters who want to wait until Election Day, they should feel confident that they’ll have a chance to cast their vote, just as countless others have done successfully in past elections.

The idea that early voting boosts turnout isn’t universally accepted. While it does add flexibility, which is certainly beneficial, early voting alone doesn’t necessarily result in higher participation. Other efforts—like voter outreach, education, and engagement—tend to have a stronger impact on bringing more people to the polls.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

I also wouldn’t be surprised if some people are a bit leery of mail-in voting and are opting to vote in person on Election Day where mail is the only early-voting option.

Argued November 28, 2023


Here’s the other relevant law from Texas.  Section 170A.002 prohibits a person from performing, inducing, or attempting an abortion. There is an exception for situations in which the life or health of the pregnant patient is at risk. In order for the exception to apply, three factors must be met:
• A licensed physician must perform the abortion.
• The patient must have a life-threatening condition and be at risk of death or
“substantial impairment of a major bodily function” if the abortion is not performed.
“Substantial impairment of a major bodily function” is not defined in this chapter.
• The physician must try to save the life of the fetus unless this would increase the risk of the pregnant patient’s death or impairment.
There are additional situations where the exception for the life or health of the patient does not apply. Please read the entirety of Section 170A.002",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"So you know better than doctors about how they themselves are confused and fear potential legal repercussions of the abortion ban law?

>ProPublica condensed more than 800 pages of Crain’s medical records into a four-page timeline in consultation with two maternal-fetal medicine specialists; reporters reviewed it with nine doctors, including researchers at prestigious universities, OB-GYNs who regularly handle miscarriages, and experts in emergency medicine and maternal health.

>Some said the first ER missed warning signs of infection that deserved attention. All said that the doctor at the second hospital should never have sent Crain home when her signs of sepsis hadn’t improved. And when she returned for the third time, all said there was no medical reason to make her wait for two ultrasounds before taking aggressive action to save her.

>“**This is how these restrictions kill women,” said Dr. Dara Kass, a former regional director at the Department of Health and Human Services and an emergency room physician in New York. “It is never just one decision, it’s never just one doctor, it’s never just one nurse.**”

>There is a federal law to prevent emergency room doctors from withholding lifesaving care.

>Passed nearly four decades ago, it requires emergency rooms to stabilize patients in medical crises. The Biden administration argues this mandate applies even in cases where an abortion might be necessary.

>No state has done more to fight this interpretation than **Texas, which has warned doctors that its abortion ban supersedes the administration’s guidance on federal law, and that they can face up to 99 years in prison for violating it**

“Around 4:20 a.m., OB-GYN William Hawkins saw that Crain had a temperature of 102.8 and an abnormally high pulse, according to records; a nurse noted that Crain rated her abdominal pain as a seven out of 10.

Her vital signs pointed to possible sepsis, records show. It’s standard medical practice to immediately treat patients who show signs of sepsis, which can overtake and kill a person quickly, medical experts told ProPublica. These patients should be watched until their vitals improve. Through tests and scans, the goal is to find the source of the infection. If the infection was in Crain’s uterus, the fetus would likely need to be removed with a surgery.

In a room at the obstetric emergency department, a nurse wrapped a sensor belt around Crain’s belly to check the fetal heart rate. “Baby’s fine,” Broussard told Fails, who was sitting in the hallway.

After two hours of IV fluids, one dose of antibiotics, and some Tylenol, Crain’s fever didn’t go down, her pulse remained high, and the fetal heart rate was abnormally fast, medical records show. Hawkins noted that Crain had strep and a urinary tract infection, wrote up a prescription and discharged her.

Hawkins had missed infections before. Eight years earlier, the Texas Medical Board found that he had failed to diagnose appendicitis in one patient and syphilis in another. In the latter case, the board noted that his error “may have contributed to the fetal demise of one of her twins.” The board issued an order to have Hawkins’ medical practice monitored; the order was lifted two years later.

"It's NY.

You either show proof of identification (a valid SS# or driver's license or other form of unique ID) when you register to vote, or you show it at your polling place when you go to vote. You still have to provide the state with some form of identification at some step in the process.

You report to the specific polling place your local board of elections has assigned to you, which has a list of all registered voters in the precinct, and your name and signature (given either when you get your driver's license in NY, or when you register to vote) are checked against records when you go to vote to ensure no one votes multiple times and no one votes under someone elses' name/identity.

There are plenty of safeguards in place against the type of fraud she seemed to enjoy fantasizing about, without requiring someone to have a specific piece of ID on their person at the time of voting.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"many states do not require an ID. but the vote is tied to your address that you are registered to. if there are multiple votes by someone of the same name at the same address, it gets caught. if you tried to vote and give an address you are not registered at, you will not get a ballot.

well, you might get a provisional ballot, but unless you are mentally incapacitated in some way (say, 90s and possibly senile), it will get caught and something will come of it. 

even though US elections are locally run, there s a lot of steps in place to prevent voter fraud. stuffing ballots is a thing of the past. 

as a side note, the only way voter ID would work in the US would be if it is both free and required. AKA a national ID card, which has long been seen as unwanted and arguably now unnecessary. But once national ID cards became possible, it was seen by many quarters as ""papers"" that could be used to restrict travel like in the soviet union or under the nazis. the closest the US probably came to it was the Clinton proposed national health ID for the failed national health insurance legislation, which all but certainly would have resulted in everyone getting an ID card of some kind (or be signed up for one at a hospital visit).",2024_11_03,05_39_45

">According to Wolff, Epstein had placed a bid on a house in Palm Beach, Florida, for around $36 million and asked Trump for advice about moving the property's swimming pool. The former president is then said to have ""gone around Epstein's back"" and bid $40 million for the house, said Wolff.

>""Epstein knew that Trump didn't have the money, therefore Epstein's conclusion was that he must be fronting for someone,"" Wolff said.

>""And in fact, in that classic money laundering setup, Trump bought the house for $40 million, bought it through borrowed money, and then the house was put on the market not long afterward and immediately sold for $96 million to one of the oligarchs in the close [Russian President Vladimir] Putin circle.""",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Edit: I've been corrected - Wolff only released some short snippets on his podcast.  He did not - so near as I am aware - provide any material to a real news outlet.  Coming through a secondary news source, it will likely be a bit harder to check the audio for modification (it's would have been compressed).  What's there is certainly not pretty - but really, if they guy wanted to be a legitimate reporter rather than a podcaster, he could have done this broadcast a month ago, then provided the tapes to MSM, and probably gotten a lot of mileage out of it.

I work elections, and my local clerk's office has been scrambling to keep up with the early voting and absentee voting, even though they are generally incredibly well prepared. The voting database software that allows them to print out the labels to put on absentee ballots was overwhelmed and created problems statewide in Wisconsin during the first few days of early voting. They got it sorted, but it wouldn't surprise me if they actually had software issues on the last day to request absentee ballots.

"Haven't read the article, so purely speculating here, but I'm going to assume that they were severely understaffed.
Been an issue since the 2015/2016 election cycle. Election Workers/Staff have been quitting in droves since Trump/MAGA started to grow.


It was already not great/facing decline before that because a lot of people working those jobs were getting pissed/demoralized at the Republicans' unhinged behavior during the Obama years, but it got so much worse during that first Trump Election Cycle that it caused a slow but gradually accelerating Exodus.


It got worse during/because of Trump's presidency, 2018 was horrible for those poor election workers, then 2020-2021 came along & it was beyond insanity.
The Attempted Coup & all the Batshit Republican/MAGA harassment& terrorism targeting election workers/officials got beyond horrible.


2022 seemed tame/calm but it was not good. It was somewhat less horrific & less violent than the previous cycle, but that's only because of the perceived lower stakes of midterms. There was still a ton of aggressive/borderline if not outright) violent behavior & harassment.
It was just tame in comparison to the previous cycle. 2022 was worse than the 2015/2016 cycle & the 2018 midterms.


All that to say that when you become critically understaffed, you might be able to see the Freight train that's about to hit you coming from 10 miles away & still feel/be powerless to do anything about it, because you're not being provided with the resources to do anything about it.


You keep hoping that the People with the power to provide you with the necessary staff &/or funding will finally get off their a..es & give you what you need. You could plead & beg & grovel & go complain to anyone who'll listen, but still be unable to do anything because everyone refuses to take this seriously.


Maybe the press/media will listen for a bit & report oon it, but it often won't be nearly enough to affect any change, other than you getting chastised behinf closed doors for complaining to the press. A few BS promises to investogate & intervene if necessary are made by a few officisls, the press moves on, nothing gets actually done.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"This is my conspiracy theory on why Republicans are REALLY stepping up their “stamp out the vote” campaigns.  The demographics are killing them.

And… look, you see it at the polls, and have for a decade.  Majority black district, democrats almost always win it?  In a red state, they get one voting machine at a particular polling station, maybe 2.

I'm saying that this seems to put the blame on Election Workers/Officials, when we all know that the real issue is higher up the chain.


It's 100% on Republicans/Republican Politicians.


I have a very strong dislike of all Republicans, because they stand for abhorrent ideas/ideologies but I can honestly state that I feel bad/sympathize with a lot of election officials, even the blatantly Republicans ones, because they have really received the sh.t end of the stick over the past 8/10 years & most of the current issues that they have to deal with or are being accused of failing to address are actually absolutely none of their doing.



Read some News Articles about what's been happening instead of raging at me for telling you that it's aactually not their fault.


My favorite article l, wjich I sadly gouldn't find again, was about a well-known, highly respected (by Republicans), deeply Republican, Trump supporting/voting, previously highly respected in his deep red district, election official who rage quit after the MAGAts threatened & terrorized him & his family, including with very specific Death Threats, because despite hisbown atrocious beliefs & Politics, he still believed in following the Law & enforcing the rules.
Conservatives still won by a wide Margin there, but that margin was much lower than it used to be, so the RedCaps accused him & everyone else of rigging the elections. He was not the only one who quit.
Some of the old guard was staying to try to keep the ship afloat & going, but it wasn't looking good for future elections.



When that's the State of your Election Work/Department, you can't really blame the election officials when everything eventually & inexorably turns to sh.t.


You could say that this Republican Official I mentioned brought it on himself by continually supporting a very toxic party/culture & participating in/bringing in his own downfall in doing so, but you can't blame them, individually, for the degradation of service.
Can't blame them individually, if the whole thing went/goes to sh.t.


You especially can't blame any Democrat-leaning official who had/has to deal with the exact same BS, because you don't even have the excuse that they supported/participated in/voter for this increasigly toxic garbage.

To mark the night before Election Day, the campaign will host simultaneous “get out the vote” organizing events in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Those events will then be tied together in a show for voters nationwide to tune into, according to the official.

The events will feature Harris, her running mate Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), top surrogates and performers, the official said, adding that details on the performances are forthcoming. The campaign is also offering VIP seating at the events for every volunteer who completes a phone banking or door knocking shift between Oct. 28 and Sunday, Nov. 3.

Harris will be in Pennsylvania, the battleground state that carries the most votes in the Electoral College, on Monday for stops in Allentown, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"David Bowie once livestreamed a concert on the internet. I remember watching it, even though it was blocky dialup and buffered incessantly. He was a video game. On the forefront of a lot of new movements.


I get the same vibes from Harris-Walz. They're just on the pulse in a way that shows they know where people and progress are. I love it.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"This and her ad on The Sphere are such in-your-face power moves. They’re as much about showing off for the voters as they are about making trump really sweat and feel small. So much of the Harris campaign has been like that. Even the roll call at the DNC was like that. And when they show  Trump in whatever sad half-empty midsized arena his Monday night rally is in , on a split screen next to Harris and her surrogates in eight huge screaming, overflowing arenas, that’s going to knock some voters off the fence and into the voting booth.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Bingo. People forget that MAGA also attacked state capitol buildings and also the governors mansion here in Washington 4 years ago. They have been primed for years now that violence is the only retribution going forward,2024_11_03,05_39_45

"As someone who works right by the state capitol in Olympia and thinks about this stuff a lot, I don't think a handgun is really going to be a help. I think what is most plausible in terms of political violence is an increase in bombings and fires—like the ballot box fires this week. Dangerous, yes, but not something a handgun would help with.

We're a long way away from a situation where you need a personal firearm to protect yourself from political violence. If you want to take proactive action, however, make sure you have an emergency bag (you can buy them on Amazon, and they come with emergency food, first aid kits, emergency blankets, etc.) and keep a supply of cash on hand. Things that will help you in the event of a power outage or shelter in place order.

If we ever get to the point where you *really* need a gun, I don't think you'll be pondering it. It'll be a pretty clear decision. Hopefully we never come to that point.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
"I was very much not about ever having a gun yet I do now and for 5 years now. It’s a hand gun that is loaded with one in the chamber and at my bedside. I visit the gun range frequently to practice and for muscle memory and have taken some classes on gun laws, proper defense, etc. I’m now confident I can defend myself in my home. 

I don’t like the above one bit but I started to learn and understand the past 10 years since Trump entered politics, and all that has gone on, that democracy is in peril. In a few days time we are going to be experiencing civil unrest like we’ve never seen before and no matter who wins. 

I’m 60 years old, a moderate liberal and have traveled the world and studied international politics, etc. I truly believe that democracy is dying.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

Okay so let’s brush up on some American history shall we? They wished to no longer be under the thumb of a king (though by today’s standards more of a dictator….the Republican nominee is trying to become a dictator.

Who’s going to win? The “infrastructure week” team? I don’t mean to be crass—this sucks and totally has the potential to be very bad in terms of innocent life—but I just don’t believe these guys can do it. And whatever they pull is just gonna turn more and more Americans off—it won’t reverse the election, but will certainly fuel their own destruction. They couldn’t overthrow the government when Trump was in charge, how are they gonna do it now? I just don’t see it.

Now, if they ratfuck the election hard enough that’s another story. Because then democrats will likely just roll over because “precedence” as if there is any precedence. 

Vote, everyone!",2024_11_03,05_39_45
The WA-Rs are a cluster fuck. Their nominee for Governor didn’t even get the party’s nomination during the primaries and beat out the guy they threw their support and (limited) money behind. If current polling stands the Dems will win a supermajority in the state.,2024_11_03,05_39_45

"The guy that’s running for governor right now for us democrats is the former insurance commissioner.

This is the guy who decided that paying for insurance in case you ever have to defend yourself with a firearm is “murder insurance” even though it’s extremely clear and obvious that no business will pay you a dime if you’re convicted. The idea behind the insurance is that if you legally defend yourself or others, you shouldn’t have to go bankrupt about it.

Why I care: In 2020/2021 crime was rising where I live, and suddenly my wife thinks we should own a gun. I started researching pistols (I’d only ever owned rifles prior) and ran across this.

Ferguson will be the next governor but I didn’t and won’t ever vote for him.

I don’t question at all that the republican candidate is likely also a clown.",2024_11_03,05_39_45

"The republicans in the state have gone knee-deep into the trump/maga world, which is politically insane in WA state. We have our fair share of weirdos but we have a large amount of moderates and independents but instead of appealing to them the WA-Rs doubled down on the extremist wing of the party. They basically had one path to win seats in the state and that was before a court ordered redistricting, and they chose the narrowest path possible. I guess this could be said about a lot of state R parties or the party as a whole.",2024_11_03,05_39_45
