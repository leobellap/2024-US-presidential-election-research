"Teary-Eyed is more than appropriate. This election is so bogus it should be making every sane person visibly upset and tear up. Why are we even questioning whether Kamala should be president or not? Whether she‚Äôs qualified or smart enough for the job (she‚Äôs EONS more qualified than trump anyways, he doesn‚Äôt even have a history in politics before his bid for President)? Why are we giving a felon and sex offender a shot back at the White House? What is America doing? I wish we‚Äôd screw our heads back on and use basic 5th grade critical thinking skills and see that this election shouldn‚Äôt even be happening, because Trump shouldn‚Äôt even be on the ballot. this will NEVER make sense to me.

"I own a Senior Home Care business. Harris‚Äô proposal to expand long-term elder care would destroy my company. Why? Because I decided when I started the business that I was going to be immediately paying living wages to my employees at about $18/hr. We are private pay and charge out at about $30/hr to do a little more than break even. Unfortunately, Medicaid only reimburses at $21/hr in my state. This means if her plan passes- my business shuts down. 

When all things are said and done I make about $60k a year after expenses (but before income taxes). So I‚Äôm not rich. 

All that said- I‚Äôm still voting for Harris. Because people are more important than money, and that wannabe Mussolini has taken so much away from us and ripped families apart. It‚Äôs time to end his regime.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"A couple years back I realized that in 2026 the U.S. will have its 250th anniversary.

250 years old.¬†

I wasn‚Äôt alive for the last big anniversary in 1976, likely won‚Äôt be alive for the next, but this time I will be and I DO NOT want the celebrations to happen under Trump.¬†

I know that this sounds stupid in the scope of things at stake, but honestly, to have this ‚Äúexperiment in democracy‚Äù make it to 250? It‚Äôs not that small a thing and it would be SO.dang.good to have something like this to celebrate and be proud about (even if that pride is small right now).

Especially for the young. For all the Gen Zs and now even the Alphas.

I know that the country is in rough shape (maybe not so bad in global/economic standing but definitely so in a lot of other things that do also matter) and I know that Gen Z and the young today are very aware and recognizing of this (much more so than the previous generations were) and not feeling especially proud of their country‚Ä¶ which is precisely why we need to be able to celebrate making it to 250.

Because if the democracy for which the U.S. stands can make it, then we have **a chance** to start or keep working toward more things that they, that we all, can be proud about. Not like the old ‚ÄòMurica pride that my generation grew up with, but pride in things that really are special and better.

It‚Äôs a chance at better and yeah, maybe a chance doesn‚Äôt sound like much (it really doesn‚Äôt feel like much) but, honestly, unfortunately, all good things take work. (The whole point of this country is¬†to have a chance, isn‚Äôt it?)

Making it to 250 and beyond will take work and a high degree of awareness and seriousness, but it‚Äôs work that can build into something worthwhile and, along with what we didn‚Äôt have before: the new self-reckoning that the new generation has, it‚Äôs work that can build into something that‚Äôs truly pride-while.

But the only way we can have that chance is ¬†if the democracy can be preserved, and the only way that can happen is if Harris is elected president.

There really is no other way. Vote Harris/Waltz.

And to make the work ahead a little easier, consider voting blue all the way down.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

They just did it, and my colleagues and I had to take the brunt of everyone's anger while trying to pretend like we knew what was going on.

"I'm currently sitting on the couch, preparing to get myself to work and somehow not obsess about this election. But the truth is I'm terrified.

At the most damaging, America ceases to be a democracy. And our choice does extend to the world. He'll roll back all climate initiatives and remove all regulation. As a top polluter, this election is probably the last straw for our planet.

Yet, here we are. A toss-up race. And my five month old son, sleeping upstairs will shoulder most of the weight of the implications of which side it lands on.

As an American, I‚Äôm proud of my ideals that we should have good relationships with other countries, and work together for our mutual safety and prosperity. I want my country to stand firm for what‚Äôs good in the world. I guess mostly I‚Äôm just really moved because we are such assholes here and I just figured no one would show up for us.

"Yes, America, we need you to come out in force and reject populism and fascism in unprecedented numbers tomorrow. American politics are global politics and if somehow Trump wins this, it'll be a bad time for you and for the rest of the world. 

Over here in Europe, Trump will obviously hand Ukraine to Putin on a silver platter. Essentially, Ukraine will be history by the end of January if Trump gets back into the White House. Considering that he has also signalled that he will order the US military from not fulfilling your NATO obligations anymore, this will also spell doom for our Eastern European allies who Putin considers in his sphere of influence, such as the Baltic countries, Poland, Montenegro and others. 

In the Eastern Mediterranean Trump will hand Netanyahu free rein to fully implement his final solution for Palestine and over in Asia-Pacific, Taiwan will get a rough deal where the United States' ongoing protection from Xi will be contingent on how many chips they deliver to the US. That will lead to an enormous strain on international technological development. 

Economically, he has already said that he will start a trade war with all of us at once, which, yes, will hurt us, but will probably hurt you more. Especially when you combine that with the enormous economical downturn precipitated from rounding up and extraditing millions of migrant workers in the US. Combined, this will likely lead to a sustained, global recession. 

Ecologically, a Trump win will set climate change back by years and will lead to irreversible damage to whatever is left of our fragile ecosystem. Humanity's continued ability to survive the climate catastrophe hinges on your decision tomorrow. 

He has also signalled that he will instate vaccine-denying crackpots into senior roles at HHS, which could lead to an absolute catastrophe for all of us when the next pandemic rolls around. It's only a matter of time until that happens and we can't have someone like RFK jr at the helm when it does.

Ossoff and Warnock won their 2021 runoffs by 55,232 votes and 93,550 votes respectively.

>The idea behind paid relational organizing is this: Ossoff campaign hired 2,800 Georgians, particularly those with little or no voting history themselves, to become ‚Äúcommunity mobilizers‚Äù ‚Äî a term Ossoff coined for their role. The campaign suspected that those organizers would be well-positioned to influence irregular voters or nonvoters in their own personal networks to get involved.

Trump and all these shitty populist movements are a sign that we are entering a long cycle of Liberal politics. It always gets violent and crazy at the end of these cycles. Look at the 60's in the US for example, that was the prelude to the end of the New Deal era. Worldwide the Boomer generation was more conservative than their parents and they dominated everything for the past 50 years. Millenials started exerting their force as early as 2008 with Obama and are just now hitting their stride during the Trump era.

Our system, meanwhile, is too reliant on an honor code that is susceptible to bad actors.  There isn't much accountability at the higher levels, and we give a disproportionate amount of power to land mass because the founders were concerned about the majority trampling the minority at all times.

The Trump era has exposed the leaks in our media literacy, competency, and accuracy, as well.  There are some natural consequences of capitalism at play in that, but there's also the shift in the Overton Window and not much recognition of it from key players.  Everyone has been treating the republican party like the same old republican party and standards have never been lower.

">Danielle Butterfield, executive director of the Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA

Ok this is a great name for a PAC. 

>none other than Stephen Miller believes that the racist joke at Trump‚Äôs Madison Square Garden rally, which compared Puerto Rico to a pile of garbage, was a ‚Äúhuge unforced error‚Äù 

>Butterfield: A really big difference between people hearing Trump‚Äôs words and Trump‚Äôs allies words in this context is that ***they have a retrospective understanding of not just his words but his actions*** and how the two can be really related to each other. When we heard messaging at the MSG rally last week, there was a really easy ability to then connect that to how he handled certain situations when he was president. ***It‚Äôs not just a flippant joke but a representation of how he actually acted.*** For example, we‚Äôre running an ad right now targeting Puerto Rican voters in partnership with Somos Votantes across the battleground, particularly in Pennsylvania, that really ties together the joke about Puerto Rico being an island of trash up against how Trump handled Hurricane Maria. That ad is testing really well amongst Latino voters, in particular Puerto Rican voters, because it reminds them, and it really contextualizes, ***that this isn‚Äôt just words, it‚Äôs his actions.*** That‚Äôs a really big shift that we‚Äôre seeing this year in terms of our ability to show Trump‚Äôs impact. 

>One other thing that we are seeing is that ***young voters are hearing audio from Trump‚Äôs Billy Bush interview where he said grab them by the p-word‚Äîthey‚Äôre hearing that for the first time this year***, even though it leaked originally in the 2016 cycle. This is really important because these voters who are voting for the first time in 2024 were 10, 11 years old when Trump was first elected in 2016. So when these voters are hearing this horrible sound and this horrible audio interview from Trump with his graphic depiction of how he views women, they‚Äôre hearing it in the context of him being proud of overturning Roe v. Wade. The context of how his words have actually had a disastrous impact, it‚Äôs just landing a lot differently in this cycle.

>It certainly felt good to see that Iowa polls, particularly her numbers with white suburban women and older voters. Even if we don‚Äôt win in Iowa, it‚Äôs a signal that we‚Äôre going to do well in the upper Midwest. It‚Äôs a great sign of what‚Äôs to come for Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. But it doesn‚Äôt change our strategy. Neither of these polls change our strategy at this point, which is that we need to continue to persuade and mobilize these voters in the final stretch. ***The thing that doesn‚Äôt necessarily get reported as much is that we‚Äôre doing it with such joy.*** Seeing all these Harris volunteers out on the doors with their rogue merch that they made at home and their friendship bracelets and having just an amazing back and forth on SNL last night about Harris‚Äôs ability to drive joy in this final stretch. That‚Äôs giving me a lot of hope.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"I'm so tired of hearing about ""undecideds"" in this election cycle. Who in the hell is ""undecided"" at this point and HOW could they be? I feel like every interview with an ""undecided"" voter that you see on the news is someone who knows damn well who they are voting for, and has for a long time, they just want their 5 minutes of fame on CNN.

Overall I feel like this is an aspect of the election that is driving the very bad polling and herding phenomena we're seeing. Polling models make some big assumptions about undecideds and their propensity to vote. In this election cycle though, I think that in reality very very very little of America is or has been undecided for a long time. As soon as Trump made it official that he was running again I think that close to 100% of the public that was ever going to vote was decided. Maybe a chunk of Biden voters waffled a bit when they saw him visibly deteriorating in the first debate, but that was completely cured by him dropping out and being replaced by Harris.

It just doesn't make logical sense. Show me a person who honestly voted for Biden in 2020 but now wants to vote for Trump. Maybe you can find a handful of people but I think that it's very obvious that the opposite scenario is more likely. So I don't buy any of these polls showing ""a dead heat."" Trump is a known quantity and the majority of Americans despise hearing his name at this point and want him to go away. More than anything, this election is going to come down to that. I believe Harris is going to win very soundly and we wont have to wait days for the results.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"Astonishingly, people aren‚Äôt flocking to support a candidate who, by all appearances, embodies every quality one would avoid in a leader. After all, who wouldn‚Äôt want a head of state with an impressive record of *indictments on multiple felony counts*? In August 2023, for example, a federal grand jury indicted Donald on four felony charges tied to efforts to overturn the 2020 election‚Äîa shocking but strangely fitting credential for someone claiming to defend democracy (U.S. News Staff, 2024).

Or take the candidate‚Äôs $5 million liability for sexual abuse and defamation‚Äîanother feat few could achieve, awarded by a New York jury in May 2023 for abusing writer E. Jean Carroll (U.S. News Staff, 2024). But perhaps nothing quite displays ‚Äúpresidential qualifications‚Äù like a 37-count indictment for mishandling classified documents. After all, who wouldn‚Äôt entrust national security to someone facing federal charges for obstructing justice with sensitive government secrets (U.S. News Staff, 2024)?

Yet, somehow, the irony only deepens. Donald has accused opponents of corruption and dishonesty, rallying a base that seems blind to the glaring accusations of *fraudulent business practices and tax evasion* directed at him. Multiple investigations have scrutinized his finances, revealing practices that, for most of us, would mean not just a loss of reputation but likely bankruptcy and financial ruin (U.S. News Staff, 2024). And speaking of bankruptcies, Donald's businesses have filed for protection several times, raising questions about his financial savvy and business ethics (Bennett, 2022).

Here‚Äôs where the propaganda model, as outlined by Noam Chomsky, fits neatly into the picture. Chomsky noted how influential figures deflect their faults by accusing others of what they are guilty of. Donald doesn‚Äôt just deny these accusations‚Äîhe turns them into proof of his victimhood, claiming to be the one true patriot under attack by a corrupt establishment. This is propaganda at its finest: flipping accusations into badges of honor and reframing felony indictments and court rulings as evidence of a larger conspiracy (Chomsky, 1988).

The propaganda machine doesn‚Äôt stop there. Donald frequently promotes baseless conspiracy theories, eroding public trust and creating a reality in which his supporters see every indictment and investigation not as a disqualifying offense but as ‚Äúproof‚Äù that he‚Äôs ‚Äútelling it like it is‚Äù (Petersen, 2024). This tactic shifts the narrative so effectively that supporters come to view even allegations of *discriminatory housing practices*‚Äîlike the Department of Justice lawsuit for racial discrimination against his real estate company‚Äîas part of an elaborate plot against him (Bennett, 2022).

Drawing parallels to historical figures, it's noteworthy how leaders like Guatemala's Carlos Castillo Armas, Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza, and Venezuela's Nicol√°s Maduro have risen to power. These leaders often employed divisive rhetoric, portraying themselves as saviors against perceived threats while consolidating power through undemocratic means. Notably, U.S. involvement has played a role in the ascent of some of these figures. For instance, the CIA orchestrated the 1954 coup in Guatemala, leading to Castillo Armas's rule (Wikipedia contributors, 2024). Similarly, the U.S. supported the Somoza dynasty in Nicaragua for decades (Timeline of US-Latin American Relations since 1823, n.d.). Chomsky's analysis highlights how propaganda and external backing can facilitate the rise of such leaders, drawing concerning parallels to current political dynamics.

He started that debate with a disciplined argument about immigration. It was an absurd argument based on false pretenses and made up bullshit, but it was disciplined and probably pretty effective. At that exact moment, he went on tilt. It was cinematic actually--like in Rounders when Teddy KGB realizes that Mike spotted his ""tell.""

He had no more disciplined arguments that night. After that, he just started canceling every appearance where he didn't feel safe. He kept saying crazier and crazier things.

Now he's riding around in a garbage truck with American flags on it with a ridiculous orange vest right in the middle of him trying to argue that he didn't know anything about the ""Puerto Rico is trash"" joke. 


And for all his faults, he's a branding and media guy. He knows the average person isn't going to be able to discern his trolling Biden from the Puerto Rico crack. He knows Puerto Ricans would see that and be like ""if he didn't have nothing to do with it, what's he doing in the garbage truck?"" (an actual quote) but he's not in control of his emotions anymore. He's out of fucks to give. He's even griping at his rallies now that he doesn't want to be there, that he'd rather show up, say ""make America great again!"" and go home.

This is probably the thing giving me the most confidence in Harris' chances.

Harris would have made a more firm contrast between herself and Biden or she would have spoken out more forcefully for Palestine (or for Israel) or she would have thrown off the entire campaign schedule to appear on Rogan or SOMETHING. Instead, we've gotten the same, consistent, quietly confident campaigning for the entire time she's been running. They could be wrong, but the Harris team definitely thinks they're going to win.

Trump, meanwhile, has been talking about banning fluoride and vaccines, working at McDonalds and the garbage dump, campaigning in deep blue states to project confidence. We ignore how erratic the Trump campaign has been (even by its own standards) because it's Trump, but they are projecting the exact opposite of confidence.

"I can't wrap my head around the fact that there's still such a large group of undecided voters. The Trump voters are easy to categorize; bad people, brainwashed morons, nazis, etc. But the undecided? That's a whole other story.

Deep down, Trump's narcissism doesn't want to be President again, he wants to *beat Biden.* That's why he's had such a hard time letting go of Biden and pivoting to run against Harris.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"I think this is an extremely important consideration to make. They're disengaged, not undecided.

Disengaged voters, in my experience, aren't apathetic out of disinterest, but disillusionment. Many have lost trust in the powerful institutions that structure our society - whether government, media, schools, corporations, or all of the above - and, as a result, don't believe that they, who would see things remade in a very different way, can ever hope to be truly heard. It‚Äôs not a lack of awareness or of concern but a response to feeling consistently let down and overpowered by our society.

"This has been more or less my opinion since early this year. The polling and media trends tracking the performance for the candidates just never seemed to reflect realistic conditions of how people would be approaching this election. The only period where I felt like we started getting genuine reads on the public polling was right around after Kamala became the candidate.

When you look at all the factors heading into this election and how either campaign handled themselves, it should have been obvious that Trump was on a major back foot the whole time. He came into the election as a loser and a very viscerally disliked man by a huge portion of the country and proceeded to do nothing at all to court people to his side.

Sure he‚Äôd say stuff here and there that vocal morons would lean to and there would be plenty of bad media on whatever new supposed blunder Democrats would say, but he never was able to push major policy or ideas that would bring in a large demographic he didn‚Äôt already have.

If all you did was follow the election on Twitter then yeah it seemed so so close.

"This is my read as well.  Nothing has really changed amongst voters -- everyone knows Trump's deal by this point, so while some people may be unsure about whether they want to vote at all because the war in Gaza makes voting for Harris distasteful for them, nobody who's planning to vote is seriously not sure about whether they'll vote for Harris or Trump.  The pollsters have carefully manufactured this horse race to look like it's been 50/50 all along, either because a close race means more clicks or because they're scared of calling it for the wrong person and looking like even bigger idiots than they already do.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

I also think he set up for Harris to take over then and there, especially since a lot of the Governors in that call were ones people were suggestions to replace him.


He knew he was stepping down when he was insisting he was still all in, and the timing was pointed. It was not coincidental at all. It was strategic. They not only didn't pick a VP candidate that might counter Harris, they wasted the entire RNC attacking the wrong candidate over an irrelevant issue for Harris. Age suddenly wasn't an issue, but it was THE issue in the RNC.¬†


The timing took the wind out of their sails. No one was talking about the RNC, no one was talking about the assassination attempt, either. And again, their main line of attack, age, was no longer applicable to the Democratic candidate anymore, but it was still an increasingly bigger issue for Trump...",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"I'd go with ""serendipitous"". 

The push to get him to step down was a reaction to his debate performance, not some masterstroke of strategy.

But there were two unforeseen circumstances:

1. The switch in nominee completely disrupted the GOP campaign plan - so completely that I'll be using it as an example to teach [this](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-90/appb.htm#par2-6); and

2. Kamala turned out to be an *incredible* candidate, able to build actual enthusiasm amongst voters instead of just being the ""not-Trump"" alternative.

I was mad at the Dems for the switch at the time *because* it was reactive, not planned.

Now I'm mad at the Dems for not having identified Kamala as a potential nominee far, far earlier and doing more to build her public profile earlier. Does nobody at the DNC do succession planning?",2024_11_05,05_45_33

>Fails and Crain believed abortion was morally wrong. **The teen could only support it in the context of rape or life-threatening illness**, she used to tell her mother. They didn‚Äôt care whether the government banned it, just how their Christian faith guided their own actions.

I am not going to engage in victim-blaming; no human being deserves what happened to this young woman. But what I want to point out is the craven brutality of ""exception for the life of the mother"" that some anti-abortion people like to spew. Because it's sounds great in theory, it helps them resolve the moral quandary of wanting to control other people's bodies without coming across as cruel bastards. 

But think about what ""exception for the life of the mother"" mean. Imagine we took the same approach for all other medical issues. No treatment for headaches & migraines unless the life of the patient is in danger. Imagine a shark bites off your foot and you're taken quickly to the hospital and doctors just stand around waiting for you to be near death before intervening. Imagine how much fucking pain people will be needlessly subjected to and how many people will die for no reason at all. Next time you hear that bullshit phrase, realize what the person is saying: I want women to suffer needlessly till they're at the point of death before we give them routine medical care.

Or so she says, my mom plays dumb to avoid accountability all the time. Regardless, it was infuriating. 

Anyway, I went on to tell her great you should know that you are actually totally fine with what they just took away and as a result my life is much more dangerous. I read to her about the purposeful and senseless death of Savita Halappanavar. Our family has Irish origins and we are in contact with our relatives abroad so I was hoping this with resonate with her. As I‚Äôm sure you know, Ireland voted to have their own protections for abortion via referendum after she died. A Catholic country!! 

She countered by telling me what she thought was a genuinely sweet story of a young mother she knew who found out she had cancer while she was pregnant.

""If you and your girlfriend have an 'Oops!' and decide you're not ready to have children yet... The Republicans want you to be paying for that for the next 18 years anyway.""

I've known a few women who have had abortions - in only one case was it about not wanting children, and that was because she was 19, in an abusive relationship, and also terrified that she'd end up a bad parent like her mother. Her (divorced) mother had schizophrenia, and disappreared without warning one day when she was only 8, leaving neighbours to find her father and send her there. 

(The other cases I know were life of the mother, with severe kidney disease, and one where twins had basically half a brain between them, unlikey to survive outside the womb for very long.)

No woman decides at the 7th or 8th month -""I changed my mind, I don't want a child"". When the Republicans trot out that lie, they are just lying to create fear.  Nobody murders a baby after birth - in no state is that legal.  All sorts of misinformation is said by the side that wants to control women. 

Almost nobody uses abortion as birth control, when you condsider the cost and the toll it takes on a woman's body.  Some women may be OK with an abortion when they consider what it could have done to their life to have a child at that time, but never is it a casual decision. 

And we are seeing today, there are often valid serious medical reasons why treatment around pregnancy problems should never be complicated by legalities. It's dangerous. It can be lethal.

You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.‚Äù",2024_11_05,05_45_33

The only thing they'll advocate is abstinence until marriage because it's not about abortions or families or babies or any of that, it's about making sure people who have sex are punished.

Correct. One of the biggest eye-openers is how much they are against funding for chronically underfunded foster care systems, and even the very idea of expanding ideas like WIC to all parents, medical coverage for child birth, and so on.

"Gambling with their life, gambling with their ability to get pregnant in the future, gambling with a host of life-impairing conditions.

I have used this example with people who don't get it.

You think you should get to make decisions for yourself, right? You think government should stay out of your personal life, right? Cool, agreed.

Let's say you go to the doctor. The doctor finds something wrong with you. The doctor knows how to treat that problem. You talk about it with the doctor, and you agree that the treatment makes sense. Sounds good, right? Then the doctor tells you ""I just have to go talk to some lawyers to figure out whether I can give you this care or not. Let's hope they agree."" 

Just the fact that the doctor had to talk to a lawyer - that wouldn't sit right with you, would it? You might leave right then if you could.

But let's say you don't. The doctor makes some calls and says, sorry, can't do it, the lawyers say no. So you tell this doctor you'll just go see someone else who will do it. Well, says the doctor, they're going to do the same thing, because it's the same law across the whole state.

""I'll just go to the next state over!,"" you shout. ""Sorry,"" says the doctor, ""But I'm a reporter, and so is the lawyer, so we had to put you in the database. If you go across state lines, it's going to send an alert to the prosecutor's office.""

Long story short. This was an injunction hearing where the defense was arguing that Pennsylvania should stop Musk from continuing the giveaway. Musk's lawyer argued that there is no reason to stop the giveaway at this point because the remaining winners are already known, and none are in PA.


The judge ruled against the injunction, but did not give a reason for that ruling yet. We should have a written ruling tomorrow, but it's likely that they believe the damage is already done and PA has no grounds for an injunction preventing harm outside it's jurisdiction.

Their argument is that contact information and a **pledge** is consideration. Consideration defined by law is either money, property, a service(time), or a **promise to do or not do something** i.e. a **pledge**. Its not a weak argument. 

>That said Musk's lawyers saying the winners aren't randomly decided just helps the DA's case that it's a deceptive scam on consumers. So yeah, even though it's not a lottery it's a sweepstakes with basically false advertising which doesn't help Musk's case at all.

Its worse, its admitting guilt to setting up an illegal sweepstakes at best because you've removed chance. 

PA state law allows Sweepstakes as long as the sponsor awards the prize based on **chance**. No chance does mean its a scam. 

PA state law also forbids directly or indirectly, to give or promise or offer to give any gift or reward in money, goods or other valuable things, if it would have ANY influence on how they vote.

"No. Throughout all of human history, in every nation and in every culture the same percentage of ignorant, gullible, cowardly people form what the Romans called ""the mob"".

These are the same people religious charlatans have scammed and ripped off as the demagogues fearmonger as lie to.

And these people always fall for these very ancient lies.

The reason the human race seems to fight the same battle between ""conservatives"" and progressives is that we do. For conservatives, the core issue is a GENETIC one -- they have an overactive amygdala (a region in the brain) and so they innately respond to the new, unique, or unknown with FEAR instead of curiosity.

This is their defining characteristic...the thing all ""conservatives"" have in common.

How can they escape this trap? Easy. Through education (re: ""there is no reason to fear these other people"") and through desegregation (re: ""I grew up with those people, they are just like us"").

Not coincidentally, through all of human history ""conservatives"" have always fought against educating everyone and fought for segregation. This is why.

When these things do not happen, a huge percentage of the population is ripe for exploitation by religious scammers, fearmongering demagogues, and snake oil salesmen (e.g. the NRA, weight watchers, and the make-up, beauty, and fashion industries, etc. etc.). It's also why the same people who have fallen for Trump's age old blood libel/Nazi lies are the same ones who haven't realized that the Sunday morning preacher has always been lying to them for their wealth, power, and sexual favors from them, their families, and their children.

So, every country has these people in its population. But, depending on education and desegregation, this might be a smaller or larger problem. But it is always a problem that decent, sane, rational, empathetic people have to deal with...every generation.

It is not true that a lawyer only has a duty to be truthful with the court. In representing a client, a lawyer cannot lie about material facts to anyone, the press included. 

  
From the ABA Model Ethics Rules:

Rule 4.1: Truthfulness in Statements to Others

Transactions With Persons Other Than Clients

In the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly:

(a) make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; or

(b) fail to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client, unless disclosure is prohibited by Rule 1.6.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

If this is an actual pending prosecution, Musk's attorney might be obligated to share such knowledge with prosecutors. But not with reporters on a potential case that hasn't been filed yet. 

Why should we have such a disclosure duty to the general public, and why should that be superior to the duty of confidentiality we owe our clients?

"This reminds me of the fox domestication experiment. A very long running project in Russia where foxes were selected for their absence of fear when approached by a human instead of cowering away in fear and allowing the human contact and even show the curiosity you mention.

Selective breeding increased this. The brains of the tamer animals showed neurochemical changes like increased serotonin levels.

>Perhaps the most important observation emerging from this series of experiments is the fact that tame females exhibit statistically significant changes in certain neurochemical characteristics in such regions of the brain as the hypothalamus, midbrain, and hippocampus. The level of serotonin and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid turned out to be higher in tame than in unselected females. This fact fits the type of behavior, since serotonin is known to inhibit some kinds of aggression. Serotonin plays a role in the central regulation of the hypothalmic-hypophyseal-adrenal-sexual system. Thus, selection for tame behavior is associated with changes in both the central and peripheral mechanisms of the neuro-endocrine control of ontogeny.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox

Interesting is that the opposite was also tried.

>Breeding for aggression

>After initiating his selective breeding program for tameness, Belyayev also began breeding a line of fearful, aggressive foxes. In addition, he started domesticating other animals. He and his team started working with rats in 1972, and later with minks and, briefly, with river otters, although this last experiment was abandoned because the species ""proved difficult to breed"". The experiments with rats and minks, however, proved successful, with the subjects becoming tame alongside the foxes. After Belyayev's death, his rat experiment was carried on by Irina Plyusnina. ""Siberian gray rats caught in the wild, bred separately for tameness and for ferocity"", reported The New York Times, ""have developed ... entirely different behaviors in only 60 or so generations"".[8] When geneticist Svante P√§√§bo was in Novosibirsk in 2003, he visited the institute, and ""was stunned"" by the two groups of rats. ""After just 30 years of selection"", P√§√§bo said, ""the IC&G researchers had fashioned two populations that could hardly be more different.""

What if more peace loving Democrats and more agressive Republicans prefer partners from their own group and this results in selective 'breeding' causing similar enhancement of these traits as was achieved in these animal experiments?

Donald Trump Has Lost His Sh*t
There is no ‚Äúcontext‚Äù for performing fellatio on a microphone. He‚Äôs gone batty. The only remaining question is whether enough voters recognize it.

Michael TomaskyNovember 4, 2024
Donald Trump points enthusiastically.
I woke up Saturday morning, as you may have, to the sight of Donald Trump performing fellatio on a microphone (no, I‚Äôm not linking to it). The clip that was making the rounds on X was 27 seconds. As I scrolled down, I noticed a tweet from a MAGA person scolding the non-MAGA world and offering a clip that ran to about two minutes. This ‚Äúcontext,‚Äù this person suggested, would explain why he did this and prove once again how diabolically slanted the media was, and how unfair the world was to Trump.

I watched the longer version. Um, news flash: The ‚Äúcontext‚Äù didn‚Äôt help. His mic went out. Someone handed him another one. He griped about his mic for a while. He held the working mic at his side and started to speak, I suppose demonstrating what it was like to be standing on a stage speaking without being heard, when suddenly he did that ‚Ä¶ thing he did.

So no, there is no context. There‚Äôs no conceivable explanation that would leave us thinking, ‚ÄúOh, OK, sure, so that‚Äôs why he emulated a blow job. Who among us wouldn‚Äôt?‚Äù

Well, maybe there‚Äôs one.

Trump is fully losing it. Watch any of his recent speeches for five minutes. He‚Äôs completely incoherent. He has been this way for months, but it keeps getting worse. The only thing that‚Äôs different now is that it‚Äôs a news story‚Äîfinally!‚Äîand more people are recognizing it. Also, his crowds are walking out on him now during these rambling speeches that run to an hour and a half or more.

His campaign is a mess. Over the weekend, The Atlantic published a devastating piece by Tim Alberta about the infighting in the campaign. You really should read it if you haven‚Äôt, it‚Äôs full of stunning details. The bottom line is as you might guess: The chaos emanates from the top.

But the most interesting thing about the Alberta piece is not any specific anecdote that appears in it. The most interesting thing about the Alberta piece is that it exists at all. That is to say, that all these key players in a presidential campaign are taking time out in the last month of the race (assuming that Alberta has been reporting the piece out for a little while) to gripe to a reporter instead of sticking to doing their jobs. It‚Äôs insane.

And you know what else it is? A sign that they‚Äôre preparing for a loss. I suppose it could be argued the other way‚Äîthat Trump insiders are trying to ice rivals out of potential jobs in a new Trump administration. But I‚Äôve covered lots of campaigns in my day, from president to City Council. The people who are laser-focused on winning never do this kind of preelection sniping. You only get this from people who worry that they‚Äôre going to lose and who don‚Äôt want to be blamed so they‚Äôre still considered employable. I have no doubt there are rivalries and grudges in the Harris campaign too. There always are. But we don‚Äôt know about them and won‚Äôt until the insider books come out. That‚Äôs the key difference.

Saturday was quite a day. First, the fellatio clip. Then the Alberta piece hit. And last and best, as day turned to night on the East Coast, boom, the Selzer poll out of Iowa dropped‚ÄîHarris ahead by three. In Iowa. Could Kamala Harris really win Iowa? Nah, went the consensus. But this poll just might be telling us something about the momentum of this race.

I‚Äôm going to beg to differ. It absolutely might be telling us that Harris can win Iowa. First, Selzer is universally respected. Second, maybe Selzer‚Äôs polling method is a little different. Different how? Different in the way that is summarized in the headline Marcy Wheeler put on her write-up of the poll at Empty Wheel: ‚ÄúMale Pollsters Shocked‚ÄîShocked!!‚ÄîWhen a Woman Pollster Discovers Women Voters.‚Äù Consider for a second the landscape in Iowa: Late last summer, one of the most draconian abortion bans in the country went into effect.

In the Selzer poll, independent women are backing Harris by 28 points. Senior women back her 63‚Äì28. Sit with those numbers for a second. They‚Äôre staggering.

Could they be wrong? Sure. But here‚Äôs another question to chew on: Could the rest of the polling, which has tended to base its samples on 2020 turnout and the now-infamous ‚Äúrecalled vote,‚Äù and which is painfully concerned with undercounting Trump voters, be in fact undercounting Harris voters‚Äîthe women who are jazzed about her candidacy and the women (and men) who are post-Dobbs Democratic voters?

We‚Äôll find out soon enough, but the point for now is that it was a pulverizing piece of news that ended a week in Trump world that started out, you‚Äôll recall, with the fascist, racist, more-or-less-everythingist rally at Madison Square Garden. I‚Äôve been a little chagrined that coverage of that grisly event has focused almost exclusively on Tony Hinchcliffe‚Äôs repulsive joke about Puerto Rico, because so many other disgusting comments were vomited out from that stage. On the other hand, that coverage has given us polls like this one, again from Saturday: Puerto Ricans in Florida prefer Harris by 85‚Äì8. Not a typo. There are around 1.1 million Puerto Ricans in Florida; according to Puerto Rico Report, ‚ÄúThere are now more eligible voters from Puerto Rico in Florida than from Cuba.‚Äù Harris‚Äôs numbers among Latinos are up 15 points from July to October.

I didn‚Äôt even get to Trump‚Äôs comments about women and RFK Jr. and his inability to grab a door handle. In sum: The odor that‚Äôs emanating from the Trump campaign right now is one of total free fall. And Harris seems to be peaking perfectly‚Äîno mistakes, totally on message; great Saturday Night Live appearance; fantastic LeBron endorsement; wonderful cameos by people like J-Lo and Alicia Keys, who made beautiful remarks over the weekend at a rally outside Philadelphia.

That‚Äôs what we have on this day before Election Day: a well-run campaign with a disciplined candidate who is actually talking about people‚Äôs lives, versus a Pollock canvas of a campaign led by a candidate who is both losing what remains of his marbles and stewing ever more deeply in the vinegar of his prejudices and hatreds. The only hanging question now is whether enough Americans have taken note.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Speaking to my BiL about it and he says ‚Äúshe just has a history of terrible policies from before. I don‚Äôt think I can support her.‚Äù So let‚Äôs just completely gloss over every single goddamned day of Trump postulating into the late evening on twitter about which government agency he‚Äôs gonna shutter next. Let‚Äôs completely forget how he fired the FBI director behind his back, took zero responsibility for it then hosted the fucking Russians at the white house the next goddamned day and told them they didn‚Äôt have to worry about ‚Äúthat Russia thing‚Äù Yeah‚Ä¶let‚Äôs not talk about them using the feds as the gestapo to seize PPE supplies to sell back to us at a premium.

"Many are not voting for Trump.  They're voting against Democrats.  Kamala is fighting a decade of media spam, 2,000,000 hours of 24/7 programing.  She's not fighting Donald Trump.

Want to know what the Republicans around talk about?

It's not Trump.  It's always get the Dems out.  ""They're ruining our country,"" despite nearly all Congressional legislation has been bipartisan or hard own party lines which has almost entirely been Republican majority.  Dems haven't had dominant power in like 40 years??? No one's even seen truly Democratic legislation.  Most people living and voting are complaining at best towards their ideals, heavily bipartisan legislation, lol.  So...what have those pesky Dems actually done?

And funnily enough they're talking about Vance over Trump.  ""He looked good during the debate.""  Really?!  You watched a man hype all the things Trump is not, lying to your very face, and you think ""Yeah, he did really good up there.""???

And that's kind of the problem.  You're fighting a decade of media spam, 2,000,000 hours of propaganda.  The candidates can do no wrong.

But there is no started counter Dems have.  There is no media backing touting a false narrative, presenting a candidate that doesn't actually exist.  No.  Dems get scrutinized about a tan shirt or mustard.  Kamala gets scrutinized over the border which has a literal massive bill waiting to get passed.  Kamala gets scrutinized for being to vague about her policies despite having literally pages full of detailed policies and goals laid out.  She's attacked and belittled for things that are already accomplished.  Somehow success is...fake???  And the dumbest thing?  People complain about how she talks and laughs like it's a legitimate reason not to vote for her, NOT her policies, NOT any legislation that's happened over the last 4 years, no...her laugh and the WSU she talks.  She is not scrutinized on merit AT ALL.  Merit aren't even targets.  And they're still whining about Biden, even though he's not running, and Peloci, even though she's not running, AOC, when though she's not running, and everyone else that isn't running.  Everything is an excuse... except her actual merit and accomplishments.

Insane.

Propaganda works, and that's what she's fighting.

Want to know something REALLY interesting?

Democrats and Kamala aren't pushing the first female president narrative or the first black female president, first Indian president narrative.  They could.  They could push that hard and build fanfare around it...but she doesn't.  She's running on policy alone and a promise of a better future.  That's it.

The climax of the story is the characters ending up at a political convention where Donald Trump tries to get them to nominate him for president.

"No one is turning kids gay, and there is no such thing as post birth abortions, but I do want open borders., and I do want to severely limit the number of guns in the United States.    
  
The only difference between me and a migrant is a piece of paper that tells us where we were born. Migrants are not a problem in the United States. In fact, migrant workers can get tax codes to create bank accounts and get taxed, who are simultaneously unable to reap benefits like social security, medicade, medicare, food stamps, etc. Migrant workers contribute to our system in many ways. Work the jobs we don't want to work, pay taxes that they don't benefit from and live normal lives like the rest of us. Migrants are not violent, and do not take up housing resources or contribute to inflation. That's just a straight up lie. The rate of migrant crime is a fraction of those of American citizens.  88 percent of Fentanyl that crosses the border is caught at legal points of entry and perpetrated by American citizens. Only 8 percent is caught at ""the border"", and the includes vehicle searches at the point of entry. The Republican party uses Anti-migrant sentiment as a mechanism to divide the labor class from uniting against corporate interest. If you have a boss, you and a migrant are oppressed by the millionaire/billionaire class.

I also want to heavily limit the number of guns in the US.  There are 120 firearms for every 100 civilians in the United States.  In comparison. The second highest country, Switzerland ranks second with only 28 firearms for every 100 civilians. Gun violence in Switzerland is almost unheard of, and one of the major reasons is because firearms are highly controlled. They cannot be kept in a house. They can only be stored at specified shooting ranges. Gun culture in America needs to change. A gun in America is seen as everything between a toy to a device used to save people. In reality, it is a tool designed to end life and should be respected as such. It is a FACT that gun violence and school shootings will fall dramatically if the US were to reach the gun ownership ratio to match Switzerland. Illegal guns that enter the country, and that are used on US citizens are American made. The Republican party pushes Anti-gun law messaging because the gun manufacturing industry has made a killing in profits from the blood of its customer base. It's time to reduce; our children have had enough. 

If you're a Republican voter, don't vote FOR Democrats, vote AGAINST Republicans, because they don't represent your interests, they haven't made your life better. Americans will NEVER see the benefits of Republican tax cuts, because it's a pittance compared the millions gained by the fattening of the 1%.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

I'm a progressive, but i get that there are people who are not thinking like i do. What we all need to understand is, that democracy can only function within a broad society, if people in power are willing and capable of creating compromise. Do i like compromise all the time? No. Do i wish, that my version of policy wins all the time? Sure. But i do understand the necessity of compromise to work and live together in one country as one people without getting us pitted against each other again and again and again. At the moment, the Democratic Coalition is too centrist for my liking, but it's a necessity to move forward. And even if i don't like it: It's paramount to uphold that coalition as long as it's necessary to reinstate voters rights, end voter suppression, reform gerrymandering and flush out partisan judges.

> In North Carolina, Trump kicked off his marathon final day of campaigning, calling the state &quot;Ours to lose.&quot; His schedule includes stops in Pennsylvania-one of the most critical states on the electoral map-with rallies planned in Reading and Pittsburgh before Election Day.

> &quot;People start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom,&quot; she said, a comment that triggered a fiery response from Trump that night and has since become a recurring theme in his rallies.

The other ""hits"" that played:

 * Kamala is fired 
 * Illegal immigrants committing violent crimes
 * Law enforcement and ICE are great at stopping violent crimes committed by  illegal immigrants and should be respected
 * Nancy Pelosi is bad
 * Adam Shifty Schiff is bad
 * FEMA has still not arrived to help with the cleanup in Western NC because ""they spent all their money on illegal immigrants that are taking all the Black jobs""
 * My first day I'm going to invoke the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (also blatantly reading this part off the teleprompter)

So the woman who is super accurate and released the Iowa poll showing that Kamala was up by 3 points, weights her polls based on who she expects to vote in the upcoming election. She calls it ‚Äúforward polling‚Äù which is probably why she is so accurate.

The other pollsters look at PREVIOUS elections and weight their numbers based on that, which is probably why they‚Äôve been so wrong in the past two elections. They are all hedging in favor of Trump because they fucked up 2016 and 2020, and they are afraid to be wrong again, and in doing so, they are probably going to be wrong again.

In addition to that, 150 right-wing polls (some based out of Brazil of all places) have been plopped into the numbers this year to intentionally skew the averages in favor of Trump. 75 (seventy-fucking-five) of them have been dropped in the last 8 days alone in an attempt to offset Kamala‚Äôs gathering momentum.

So if there are lots of people going to rallies, we can guess they are enthusiastic about that candidate.  Enthusiastic people tend to vote, so it's a good sign.

In the past, nobody really talked about crowd sizes at political rallies.  Trump, because he is a crowd size queen, made it out to be a sign of his popularity.  His shiny new Press Secretary told his first lie on his first day at the podium in the press room - he was directed by Trump to lie about Trump's Inauguration Day crowd size being bigger than Obama's, bigger than any Inauguration in history, even though we saw the pictures side by side with our own eyes.

Most places people like to spend time with or flock to will be an echo chamber of what they believe to some extent. Otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt return. Some of this can be more curated by themselves, the algorithm, or a mix of both.

Reddit is obviously no different and that‚Äôs a reason I bring up echo chambers and my fear of a trump win. Like maybe she isn‚Äôt leading as much as we think. Maybe all the new voters are trump supports that have rallied to his cause and newer voters for Harris end up staying home.

"Yeah I'm sorry, I'm going to strongly disagree with you here. Trump has a history of packing venues for his rallies. In 2016 and 2020 he was good for packing rallies. Even in early 2024 things were looking normal.

These recent rallies have died off days before election. Why would folks stop attending his rallies at the most exciting part of the election cycle? His supporters absolutely look at his rallies as a reason to vote for him and support him.

I think they are embarrassed and simply aren't enthusiastic.  Trump got 77 million votes nationally in 2020. I wonder if he'll even match that number. I suspect Harris exceeds Bidens 2020 numbers though, BTW.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

It is the trend and rate of change in these events' attendance which is more useful for gauging support.

There is such a divide and people are in such bubbles and even online and social media algorithms force feed you what you want to see and hear.

"The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.

This paper examines Donald Trump‚Äôs character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America‚Äôs most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington‚Äôs humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln‚Äôs moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump‚Äôs conduct‚Äîboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6th‚Äîreveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump‚Äôs character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.

We're vaguely associated with those demons in but many Trump supporters aren't actually going to hate you if they meet the real person. Granting your odds are better if you're white. 

While this is true, it's also irrelevant.  They're still more than capable of hating their imaginary version of us, and acting upon that hatred, and the people hurt by it won't find any balm in this distinction.  Their ignorance is no less dangerous for being untethered from reality, in fact if anything it makes it even worse, as there is no limit to the justifications that they will happily swallow.

>Some also just think Harris supporting people are ignorant, confused, stupid, brainwashed or whatever - as we do about them.

And yet we are right and they are wrong.  Subjectivity is not an adequate refutation of fact.  They can believe anything they want, but it doesn't make it correct, nor justify their acting upon such unfounded and incorrect beliefs.

You're teeing up a softer handling of them post-election, but that's the attitude that has let this shit fester for ages.  It's time to play hardball with them seriously enough to win - and not just one cycle, but to make their brand of hatred and tribalism ineffective as a political strategy.  Pack the Supreme Court, repeal the apportionment act for the house of representatives, eliminate/overcome the Electoral College, regulate gerrymandering at the federal level, new voting rights act, mandatory mail-in voting, automatic voter registration, *do the things that will lock them out of power forever*.  Don't ever lose sight of what they've shown you they really are and are capable of, because that won't change with the removal of Trump, and we may not get so lucky next time for their Hitler 3.0 to be the stupidest man alive and waste an entire presidential term before getting down to business.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"Aside from the election interference and violating the Logan Act, the reason he‚Äôs so desperate for Trump to win is because he‚Äôs currently facing three serious federal criminal investigations for fraud as the CEO of Tesla.

From the DoJ:

* Wire Fraud - Misleading consumers about driver-assistance systems.

* Securities Fraud - Deceiving investors about the capabilities of Tesla products to inflate the stock price.

* Securities Fraud - Use of Tesla funds on a project described internally as a house for Elon Musk

The SEC is also separately investigating Tesla for securities fraud.

* https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/tesla-elon-musk-glass-house-doj-sec-investigation-c723166b

There‚Äôs also the ongoing Greenspan lawsuit in CA which has uncovered Tesla engaging in blatant, [criminal accounting fraud and anti-consumer practices](https://open.substack.com/pub/bradmunchen/p/the-tesla-files-unveil-more-accounting?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web).

Additionally, the NHTSA report earlier this year directly linked over a hundred fatalities to FSD‚Ä¶ So who knows what will come of that. Probably a lot of very expensive civil lawsuits.

Let‚Äôs face it, it‚Äôs clear that Tesla is vaporware at this point. They‚Äôre a car company that has alienated their consumer-base, faces declining sales YoY, makes unsafe cars with [serious build defects](https://www.flickr.com/photos/136377865@N05/albums/72157658490111523/), and offers one of the worst self-driving technologies on the market because they don‚Äôt use LiDAR like everyone else; Waymo is now L4 and Mercedes is L3 while Tesla FSD is still barely L2.

Even by Elon‚Äôs own admission, Tesla is no longer a car company but a robotics company, or an AI company, or a robotaxi company where your car will earn you passive income and pay for itself, or whatever he can say to justify the stock price being higher than the rest of the auto industry combined. They‚Äôve been promising FSD ‚Äònext year‚Äô every year since 2016.

And Elon has borrowed a fortune against his Tesla stock to avoid paying taxes. The moment it tanks, which it will, he‚Äôll get margin called on his Twitter debt and be forced to sell‚Ä¶ Which will drive the price down even further.

 The satellites are designed to fall out of orbit and burn up.  That is their strength.  Low latency due to the proximity to the ground. 

The network is not fully up yet.  Thousands more satellites are needed on-station, to be replaced at regular intervals.  Starship, and it's heavy lift capacity are needed to ensure continuity.  And Starship is still just in the test-flight stage.  If the military takes it over now, who is going to run it?  Boeing?",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"From Hayes Brown, writer and editor for MSNBC Daily:

It isn‚Äôt the chance of delay that is the biggest contributor to the¬†[unease that millions of Americans have felt](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-kamala-harris-polls-win-election-anxiety-rcna176927)¬†as Election Day approaches. It‚Äôs that there is any tension about the outcome at all. The 2024 election should not be anywhere near¬†[as close as it appears](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/harris-trump-election-day-polls-rcna175495), not with Trump‚Äôs name on the ballot for the third straight election. It is disheartening, to say the least, that this should be where we find ourselves as a country once more, four years after Trump was expelled from the White House.

It is a state of play that would have seemed unfathomable in the immediate aftermath of Trump‚Äôs chaotic exit. I have not forgotten the slow, horrifying realization that Trump was not going to leave office willingly. I have watched as his various sins and transgressions have been laid bare before the public. And I have watched as he clawed his way back to the center of American politics again, poised to be an even greater threat than before.

I was speaking with a friend about this the other day. 

He disagreed with me when I said that it was a complete failure of the current administration to not to hold the seditionists in power accountable in any way. A complete failure appointing a clown of an AG, to appease GOP clowns, instead of someone that would asses and take the open threats to democracy seriously. 

We should not be staring down the barrel of another Trump presidency. There have been so many crimes that have been brushed under the rug.

Not taking them seriously, and doing fuckall about J6, its organizers, backers, and leaders was a colossal failure. 

At this point in the game, I don‚Äôt think any other policy from the Biden administration even matters, as our democracy is in danger. 

I cast a ballot for Biden, and against Trump. I was expecting *something* to be done‚Ä¶fucking *anything* to hold the people at the top of the shit storm accountable. Instead‚Ä¶we got Merrick Fucking Garland, someone endorsed by thr Federalist Society, whose inaction protected the fuckers, instead of any accountability.

The Democratic Party needs to stop worrying about what the GOP is going to think. We *know* what their plan is, and what they‚Äôre going to do‚Ä¶they never shut up about it. The only people that don‚Äôt fucking believe them, and fall for the same dumb shit, is the Democratic leadership.

"It is pretty common to wonder how someone who is not a complete idiot can vote for Trump. How can they not realize that he is a clown, a scammer, an egocentric person who only cares about himself and is in no way qualified to be President? But we must consider that if he has managed to get 65 to 70 million votes, it is statistically impossible that all of his voters are complete idiots.

The reason, which might seem a bit contradictory, is that many of those who vote for him do not actually like him but appreciate that he is capable of annoying the people they hate. They support him as a form of retribution against those who have tried to trample on their beliefs or their own convictions.

Many of those who vote for Trump do so out of impulse or a feeling of anger, wanting to be heard. As the old proverb says: ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend.""

"I really think Democrats are incapable of hearing themselves sometimes. All these outlets ever do is underestimate Trump. Over and over, again and again, without ever coming close to learning their lesson. They portray him as a clown, using their influence to bombard the citizenry with twisted stories that attempt to make him appear powerless and pathetic. Then he pulls a rabbit out of the hat and it's nothing but a sea of surprised Pikachu faces. ""How could this be? This *should not* be! After all, we did *our* jobs! We threw everything we could at the guy for four straight years!""

Never once does it occur to them that throwing *everything* at the guy was not the right move. It reeks of manipulation. The core issue here is that the American people no longer trust what the media tells them; in reality, the very fact that *the media* are the ones who went so hard against Trump actually *hurt* Kamala's chances because they are treated with such suspicion by the American people... which is tragic, of course, because the media are the ones with the reach to actually make a difference if only they had a clue what they were doing.

To be clear: I do not support Donald Trump. After January 6, I could never vote for him again. I don't think the president matters nearly as much as most people think he does, but it's certainly not *nothing* and I have to concede that, while I do not like Kamala Harris at all, Trump poses an existential threat to democracy that simply cannot be tolerated. But even *y'all* have got to admit how self-defeating the Democrats' strategies have been this time around.

They've been talking to themselves for four straight years. Why?! Solid blue Dems would *never* vote for Trump, so were *never* the ones the news media should have been trying to reach. In fact, it is the *undecideds* who will turn the tide, and the news media have had four fucking years to win those people over with *measured* and *stragetic* articles. They have failed.

The executive decision to paint Trump out as *simultaneously* a buffoon *and* an immensely dangerous existential threat to American democracy was a fatal mistake. It reeks of desperation. It makes the left look weak and fearful, like they're just throwing everything they can at the wall and hoping that something will stick. The right move would have been to lean hard into your ""Trump is literally Hitler"" angle (which isn't quite true, but I digress) because it's a focused and consistent position. This would also avoid all of the pathetic attempts to make Trump look stupid / demented / whatever else when any person with a brain can see that he isn't. He's clearly not demented. He did a three-hour Joe Rogan podcast in which he is entirely lucid -- crazy, sure, and dangerous too, because this is Donald Trump we're talking about -- but entirely lucid.

"True, but you also can't expect the justice system (or the media, or state election boards, or any other outside force) to save you from yourselves as if only preventing him from running is the answer to the Trump problem. After the four years that he had in office and especially after everything that has happened or come to light since (January 6th, the theft and distribution of United States military intelligence information, the never ending lies and barrage of vile racism, sexism and all the phobias you care to name), a vote for Trump should brand people as outcasts. Being a Trump voter should be up there with pedophilia or rape in terms of complete societal rejection. Something that people would never admit to in polite society. Yet here we are.

There is bound to be a long term decline and collapse as all military empires do. When that happens God help us all. China spends less per capita in military spending.

"Not defending trump, but ""felon"" in that context doesn't accurately portray how dangerous trump really is. Felonies are criminal offenses on a federal level, and there's a huge range of offenses all the way from bad to hot sauce straight from Satan's dickhole.

For example: my brother is a felon because he was homeless in winter season, someone offered to let him sleep in their barn as long as he watered their pot plants, and he was scooped up in a property wide police raid.

And then the election is always held during the week so that working people find it more difficult to vote. These are such basic flaws that the only reasonable explanation is that they are deliberate.

Most of the irregularities that routinely happen every USA election would put you in jail for a decade if you tried them over here, and the reason why that would happen is that none of the political parties control the judiciary or the electoral system.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"If it helps any, just know this:

A **lot** of Republican voters have clearly expressed that they fully want Trump to go away if he loses. Well, I'm sure they want him around, but ***not*** in the political realm *as a Presidential candidate*. Wanna know why a lot of them are starting to say this much more frequently?

If Kamala wins, that then means there will have been 4 *more* years of yet another Democrat winner. When you look outside of this vacuum of time right now and look at the much bigger picture of the last **2 decades**, you then see Republicans only had a measly 1-term stint of 4 years with a Republican President, sandwiched in between **16 years of Dem Presidents.**

Know why *this* is important?

Trump:

1. Will not simply opt-out of running for President for 2028. 0 chance this happens. Even his supporters mostly agree. They know ""the game"" by this point and have been honest (from what I've been reading) about their estimations for 2028's run. They are (seemingly) around 80% to 90% fully understanding that Trump **will** be the candidate for the next run. For the 2020 election, he had started sending in the official paperwork, etc. to run for President **on the very first day it was possible that anyone could sign up and do the paperwork**. No other Presidential candidate has ever done that. He did this because he ""lets out trial balloons"" (feels things out ahead of time in a type of ""testing the waters"" way) and he figured **that** specific ""trial balloon"" would be beneficial to him *no matter what circumstances surround him because he can always rescind or double down later. It's a ""back pocket"" thing for him.*
2. This is **going to** result in Trump being the candidate for 2028 when he will be **82** and even WAY more gone than he is currently. This is going to drag the Republican party into further depths considering, if Trump loses THIS time....I mean his ""brand"" is going to start getting a ton of their supporters to be very resentful towards their own party. They want to **win**, and they are perfectly fine with whining and bitching....as long as it gets them to have their way. If you keep getting them pissed off, but you then also can't **ever** deliver....I mean Trump's candidacy for 2028 is going to be **Armageddon for the Republican party.** They're only going to call ""fraud"" for as long as it feels (to them) like it ""might possibly work"". Don't underestimate their understanding of what they, themselves, do. They're fully aware that Trump didn't win in 2020, but they had seen him lie about everything under the sun **before that** and that he wound up skating away from consequences nearly each and every time, so they figure ""the ends justify the means"", so as such they just resort to lying. So, they figure if it gets them what they want, they'll lie too. *Voting in Harris/Walz is the literal best possible way to tell Trump to fuck off*.
3. IF Dems can either take the house or keep the Senate (or, miraculously, do both of those things)....I mean there is going to be some SERIOUS infighting with Republicans. Which will then help Democrats to divide Republicans. Best part, THAT division will be self-inflicted. We don't even have to do anything **except; WIN.**

If we win, we can make sure this all happens. I don't know about you, but I want to be part of history, I want to be a part of how it is we drove out a chaotic, piece of human trash, mango-tinted shit stain.

This is the ONE AND ONLY thing Trump would EVER ""lower himself"" to ask of anyone and it's only because the choice of who wins is not up to him.

He won't have that problem in 2028 if he wins. **That will be OUR problem**.

Trump's only true skill = outsourcing problems to people who (bafflingly) are willing to simply....take it on as their responsibility for him. Even when they know it's a crime. Even when they know it won't work. They still do it.

So, as such, we need to make **US** *be* his problem. Vote Harris/Walz. Start the downward spiral of the Republican party. If they lose this election, **that party is going to be absolutely shattered and isn't that precisely what we've been wanting for a long, long time? Voting Harris/Walz is the ONLY way to accomplish this feat.**

He went on a defensive position since the debate and never recovered. Roy Cohn is watching with disappointment from the lap of Satan in the fiery pits of hell. 

He did everything wrong that he possibly could. Maybe with the magic of ES&S voting machines he can steal this election but that is the absolute only way he‚Äôs going to win. Trumps campaign is dead in the water. Trump himself is cooked, you can tell the guy is just done. 

Everyone just keep voting. Every vote against him is a middle finger to the entire GOP.

IMO Trump's legal options to overturn a 2024 loss are significantly smaller than in 2020 when he was the outgoing president and other people were footing the bill. His followers are going to be really confused and pissed at him when he doesn't fight as hard as he's promised.

Yes 2020 was an unusual election year with the pandemic, yes pollsters have tried to compensate for over counting Dems, and yes overturning RvW has changed some of the political angling, but to think Harris is sitting in a *landslide* position like some are talking about in this thread is truly unhinged at worst, and based on conjecture over very few data points and best.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

""Isn't CNN left leaning?"" ""Does Twitter have a ton of bots going around it?"" It made no sense to me that there was this somewhat hidden support for Trump.

The thing is, back then, Trump was an unknown. I thought everyone that should have voted for Hillary will have learned their lesson and 2020 would be a blowout. But of course, we have goldfish memories and narrow minded vision, so moderates thought since the country wasn't burning, we might be ok with him and almost got him a second term. 

Both of those elections proved that being comfortable with vibes and polls, means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

What have we learned about positive data? Absolutely nothing. The only way I'll be confident in the enthusiasm, is if we absolutely destroy him tomorrow. Anything else is a disappointing reveal of my country's failures in recent years.

I think that's why everyone's on edge. We've been here before, the polling was wrong in his favor, and now we're apparently tied with no indication either way whether the polling is wrong in either direction. Historical results have chipped away at our confidence, and now a tiny victory seems almost like a loss.

That's 24 years straight of voting Democrat, and suddenly they switched? What happened there? Hillary failed to win over the working class. That's the story people haven't really talked much about. But I think Harris learned the lesson from Hillary's run. She's been aggressively courting the working class. So that is heartening. 

But Hillary was a combination of things. She was unpopular and had baggage. She wasn't exciting. She neglected the working class. The email scandal didn't help her either. But I think it was really a combination of it all.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"Not going to happen.  That very moment was supposed to happen after Romney, a rich cis, white male and former governor lost to Obama, a relative newcomer to politics.

The presumption was that the republican party would take steps to marginalize its extreme elements (i.e. the racists, nationalists and radical evangelicals), but they quickly realized that the extreme elements had become the plurality in their party and that many independents and centrists weren't buying the crap they were selling due to the grotesqueries of the propaganda machine (Fox News, Limbaugh, etc) associated with the party.

  
The viability of teaching out to the center died on the vine when Jeb Bush failed to secure the nomination.   Republicans knew that they had lost the popular vote 3 out of the last 4 times at that point and that the stops had to be pulled out in order to energize whatever base was rallying behind Trump.  Well, it worked for one term.

  
Fast forward to today.  The GOP has been amping up its voters on divisive rhetoric and extremism for almost an entire decade at this point.  So much so that they attacked a government building trying to assault the legislative branch of government.   It took \~6 years for the Tea party to morph into the MAGA movement and it will take at least as long to start the process of reckoning what the platform will be going forward.

  
Its become clear to me that the oligopolists would rather financially support fascism rather than try to build a 3rd party up from the ground.  Its going to take a long time for those relationships and attitudes to languish, and I don't ever expect the MAGA voters to abandon what has become a cult/religion for them.   These people are stuck with each other for a long time.    Folks like DeSantis and Cruz and other copycats will try to rebuild Trump's coalition in order to win the nomination.

  
Not that I really like 'traditional' republicans very much, but they don't have the numbers, money or willpower to turn back the clock on what the party has become.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, alone among the swing states, have not updated their laws to allow for the precanvassing (or processing) of mail ballots before Election Day, and they won‚Äôt start checking those ballots and preparing them for counting until Election Day itself.

Republican legislatures in both states have blocked bipartisan proposals to update their laws to be more like Florida‚Äôs, where election officials can report most of their vote totals by the end of the night on election night.

Some Republicans in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have resisted making the change because uncertainty and the blue shift is a feature, not a bug: It allows for calling into question the legitimacy and fairness of the vote count if Democrats.

"The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.

This paper examines Donald Trump‚Äôs character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America‚Äôs most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington‚Äôs humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln‚Äôs moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump‚Äôs conduct‚Äîboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6th‚Äîreveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump‚Äôs character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.

"I leave interpreting the polls to someone else, as that is black magic. But I can answer the specific, mathematical question you have.

You're implicitly assuming the same people are voting, that the demographics stay the same size and/or that the chance someone votes is not related to the candidate they vote for.

For example, if democrats are equally likely to vote, but republicans become much more likely to vote, then republicans could win even if there are fewer republicans in every demographic you look at.

Another example, let's say 60 percent of elderly people are likely to voting republican, and there are a million of these. And 39 percent of young people vote republican, and there are a million of these. Now democrats win with 100000 votes.

But 4 years later, 59 percent of elderly people vote republican, but there are now 1.2 million of them. There are now 0.8 million young people, and 38% vote republican. So both demographics have improved for democrats, but now the republicans win.

Like I said, this is just the mathematical answer to your questions, I'm not looking at realistic numbers.

"There are a few polls showing him gaining ground with black and Hispanic voters. Polling of Hispanic voters has been all over the place - hard to tell. And we need to remember that Hispanic voters are not a monolith. Cubans view this election very differently than Mexicans, who viewed this very differently from Puerto Ricans. We know that Trump made some serious gains in South Florida and South Texas, let‚Äôs see if he holds those together. And if he can find a way to continue eating into Democrats typical margin among Hispanic voters.

I am skeptical if Trump has genuinely made gains with black men - which is the narrative - but we will get some ideas fairly early on Tuesday. Once again, polling has been all over the place on this issue.

Florida returns will show us a lot. I don‚Äôt anticipate Harris winning Florida, but Florida has some heavily Hispanic areas and some heavily black areas which could indicate if Trump gains with those two constituencies are real.

To me, this election comes down to two things. First, Harris has made a full court press for white women in the suburbs. I will be looking to see if she outperform Biden in suburbs around major cities. Second, Trump has made a hard play for young men, especially minorities. I would be looking to see if Trump eats into Biden‚Äòs 2020 margins with black voters, or expands the progress he made Hispanic voters in 16 and 20.

Another place to watch early is Virginia. Harris will win Virginia. But I am specifically looking at the northern Virginia suburbs and the heavily black counties in Southeast Virginia to determine if either of those two trends is real. In northern Virginia, keep an eye on Loudon, Fairfax, and Falls Church city. In southeast Virginia, keep an eye on Hampton, Norfolk, and Portsmouth. If Harris loses ground among black voters in Virginia, but does not make additional gains in the affluent northern Virginia suburbs, that could spell trouble for other states with similar demographics, such as Pennsylvania. Alternatively, if we see that Harris has held the margins that Biden had in these two areas, it likely shows that she has held together the Biden coalition.

Trump will overwhelmingly win white men. Harris will overwhelmingly win minority women. The two groups that will decide this election are white women and minority men. Specifically, women in the suburbs of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and men in the cities of Philadelphia, Detroit, and Milwaukee.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

Remember when McCarthy took 15 votes to become Speaker and they just kept voting over and over? That's because the only thing they could do as member-elects was either elect a speaker or adjourn the session. They had no power to do anything but those two things.

Now just a couple of the houses near me have a single Trump sign each, and I'm seeing more Harris / Walz signs than I would have dared hope. I also have a couple of conservative family members who won't publicly admit it, but have privately told me that they're actually voting for Harris this time around.

"My dad is a pastor and even though he‚Äôs always been Republican, he‚Äôs voting Harris. Neither of my parents voted Trump in 2016, but my dad defended him at the time. My mom started voting blue or least split ticket by 2018 once she started realizing her indoctrination from Fox and growing up religiously in rural Texas. She‚Äôs always been repulsed by Trump even though she was a Romney/McCain voter. 

For my dad, he wasn‚Äôt convinced by 2020. But I think now that they started rotating through different News channels, he sees all the things Trump has some. So his main reasoning is based off ‚Äúsin‚Äù- he doesn‚Äôt agree with abortion and the trans issues, but he sees the multitude of lies, theft, adultery, violence, idolatry, etc. He basically thinks that if all sins are equal, the things Trump does and advocates for FAR outnumber anything for Kamala. 

Another big thing is him learning nuance on abortion. My sister‚Äôs first pregnancy left her in the hospital with her life at risk. Her next two pregnancies were then high risk and monitored closely, and post Roe. Because of Texas‚Äôs blanket ban, they actually had to wrestle with the implications of the law. I think the thought of losing a daughter because of no exceptions laws felt poignant for him and extreme. 

Additionally, I think seeing almost everybody in his evangelical network support Trump bothers him. He recently told me he never understood how the masses could be hoodwinked by an anti-Christ, but now he gets it. I think this helps him see how dangerous and evil Trump is; and all the pride he has in his religious identity makes him want MAGA to go away permanently and for a Conservative Party to actually have integrity. 

So even though neither of them were a Trump vote, they‚Äôre both people now voting blue. Same as my sister as well. I don‚Äôt think us being Latino had anything to do with it, or me being gay. But we‚Äôll take the wins we can get lol.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

In that case there can be an understanding that if they bring it up with some of the people they used to agree with, there is a risk of ridicule and rejection. Which is *precisely* the opposite of what they would need in that moment, they need acceptance and sympathy.

So they go to someone they think they used to disagree with.

"> Is it the case that people who are pastors cannot share their political opinions when not working as a pastor

As is often the case, there's no hard and fast answer, it's situational. The key in this situation being private versus public. Privately, that's two (or more) people having a political discussion.

Publicly, in a newspaper editorial, you're risking running afoul of the rules:

> [...] all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity. 

> Certain activities or expenditures may not be prohibited depending on the facts and circumstances.  For example, certain voter education activities (including presenting public forums and publishing voter education guides) conducted in a non-partisan manner do not constitute prohibited political campaign activity. In addition, other activities intended to encourage people to participate in the electoral process, such as voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, would not be prohibited political campaign activity if conducted in a non-partisan manner.

> On the other hand, voter education or registration activities with evidence of bias that (a) would favor one candidate over another; (b) oppose a candidate in some manner; or (c) have the effect of favoring a candidate or group of candidates, will constitute prohibited participation or intervention.

And in reading the op-ed, he is definitely violating that. So while he doesn't outright say ""the church endorses [any candidate]"", the preamble establishes his authority within the church. Kind of an unspoken thing, which works great for people not looking closely, but wouldn't fool someone at the IRS looking at it.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"We have a few things going for us - a judiciary that hasn't been politicised, the independence and integrity of the Australian electoral commission, compulsory voting, a voting system that means third parties can build their vote without being spoiler candidates, and an independent public broadcaster.   
  
But we also have extremely poor understanding of that voting system, a declining education system, a mostly ineffective anti corruption commission (that only came into being this term of government), terrible laws around political donations, a heavily concentrated media mostly based off an ""influence peddling"" business model while local newspapers can't make ends meet. That public broadcaster is a shadow of its former self, fearful of further funding cuts, and vulnerable to ""both sides-ism"". Plus we are HEAVILY influenced by what happens in the US.

We had Joh Bjelke Petersen run an authoritarian and corrupt government (eerily similar to Trump) for nearly 20 years, winning elections based on distorting the voting system. He was only held back by being a state premier. Now imagine if someone like that held power federally.

We do have two major parties, but are not stratified to these, a truly independent judiciary compared to the US, and the leader of the winning party leading the state/nation, giving less potential conflict between the nations leader and MPs (and national leaders that don't establish cults of personality as they are merely party leaders, and as we experienced often this century, can be deposed).

Many things about our society (including citizen passion about a leader or party as it exists in the US) would have to change here to enable a Trump-like figure to ascend. Gough Whitlam was revered by a good chunk of the population (in, and out of power), but lost power. Hawke too was also loved (not revered, he didn't inspire the same mythos as Whitlam), but lost power. Abbott and Howard were hard right, and lost power. We have a different political set-up and citizen buy-in for what has happened in the US to happen here without significant changes being enacted first - and the will and ability to make those changes is lacking, as they would be seen as too unpopular and have credible opposition politically, and would not be supported by the judiciary",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"Like it or not, every election from president to dog catcher is a choice between the lesser of evils. That's just the way it is.

For anyone that doesn't like Harris, consider this: Trump made hundreds of judicial appointments (some wholly unqualified), including three to the Supreme Court. The next president is likely to get at least two appointments to SCOTUS.

Getting Trump reelected will badly hurt the progressive agenda. In fact, Trump poses a threat to the existence of Democracy itself.  Harris may not be the first choice of progressives, but she is light years better than Trump. 

The way forward is not by choosing a great leader. The way forward is by maintaining a system with strong institutions that can preserve our democracy even despite a bad leader like Trump. Trump plans to deliberately dismantle those institutions. Harris may not be liberal enough for some, but she will not tear down the institutions supporting democracy. 

The progressive resistance to Harris is based on a badly mistaken way of looking at politics and government. It boils down to Harris not passing the purity test. This is a revolutionary mentality that has never worked and never will. What works is an evolutionary mentality. We can move the country to the left incrementally. But it has to start with beating Trump. 

After Harris, we elect an even more progressive candidate. With each administration comes new career professionals, new laws, new judicial appointments, new cabinet appointments, etc.  Over time things evolve in a progressive direction.  All of this may fail if those on the left that are hopelessly ideological cannot see the truth of this and refuse to help stop Trump. Ironically, they'll blame this on Harris and the Democrats, but it's their own shortsightedness.  Getting Trump reelected will set the progressive agenda back decades and anyone that can't see that is a damned fool.

I always vote progressive in the primaries. However, I refuse to throw my vote away on a third party candidate in the general election when, like it or not, this is a two-horse race. If Clinton had won in 2016, there would now be a 6-3 liberal majority on the US Supreme Court instead of the nightmare 6-3 far right majority we currently have. Women in this country became second class citizens because Clinton was not elected. We cannot afford to be obsessed with progressive purity or fantasize that ANY candidate we elect will be a saint. Hundreds of millions of real people got fucked over because the lesser evil lost in 2016. Let's not find out what additional injustices will be perpetrated under a second Trump term.

Of course, I wish our system wasn't this broken. Obviously, I wish we had different choices. But do you seriously think Trump getting elected in 2016 and ensuring decades of a far right SCOTUS helped progressive causes? If you cannot see a difference between Trump and Harris, you're a hopeless ideologue and I wager you have the **privilege** of not being affected by the adverse consequences of your own purity-obsessed ""progressivism"" (that is, assuming you're even sincere). You people do know that progressivism means *advancing* liberal causes, right? Progresivism certainly doesn't mean moving us closer and closer to fascism.

Harris is not perfect, but there is no symmetry between her and Trump. Voting for Stein or any other third party candidate serves no purpose better than it serves fascism. It is obvious that either Trump or Harris will win. It's also obvious that choosing Harris will better serve progressivism. This isn't a difficult choice at all.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"After reading the comments and headlines I was really excited to watch this. However I couldn‚Äôt stomach the episode for multiple reasons. The first I expected. Trump winning is horrific, he will profit off it, become more powerful, sell national secrets, pack the courts.

However I really thought by the end it would be a nice plea we could all rally behind. I‚Äôve been motivated to donate, call bank, because Harris represents hope.

Instead I got ‚ÄúI‚Äôm embarrassed that the first vote I cast as an American was for Biden.‚Äù So I should take away he is pandering to a voting block that doesn‚Äôt exist? The protests are made up of half people that are on student visas and half young people that don‚Äôt vote. So alienate the powerful older Jewish voting block?

Yes he made clear in his disclaimer if you are already voting for Harris this isn‚Äôt for you.

I just expected more from John, than spending the 11th hour begging people that care more about a country they left behind than their current one? About people that celebrated October 7th than screamed ceasefire!

The whole country, hell the whole world ate it all up. The fact that Harris is winning by decimals is quite telling. This country isnt dumb for voting Trump or Harris, its dumb because even after all these vultures have ruined this country, the people have not yet realized what their true power is and keep moving from one corner to the next like scared little sheep anytime some politician says or does x or y.

"Hated Trump from the very beginning, but for anyone who truly cares about Gaza and Lebanon, this argument doesn't even begin to cut it. The Biden administration has deftly maintained global consensus around Israel, while accelerating the genocide (which was their policy brainchild) in a horrific manner. The Biden admin has orchestrated not just the erosion, but the elimination of all progress in humanitarian law since WWII (Israel just bombed 34 hospitals in Lebanon, did you even hear a peep about it in the news?) They way they expedite weapons shipments, yet pacify the people with false speak of working for peace, has undermined political movements for a better future. On top of that, they are overseeing the growth of the police state, and suppression of speech exposing Israeli crimes across universities, social media, and mass media. ""Left wing"" governments across Europe are following suit: the UK just arrested a holocaust survivor for speaking out against Israel yesterday.

When the dems want to kill 100,000 people, they convince people they're trying not to, when Trump wants to do it at least he'll say it openly so people can get off their couch and protest, and he'll be less competent in the crime too.

It will be difficult for those who have made ‚Äúthis‚Äù their identity to ever let go of it. Many will never. 

I think psychedelics might help people to break out of the cycle they find themselves in. I believe they will be an important tool in the chest. 

It is ugly, hateful, morally repugnant and existentially repulsive. I want to believe that in many Trumpers, a part of their subconscious knows how bad it is, but the inertia of it all is far too great to disperse without help and tools.

The most impactful thing he did as president was appoint Supreme Court Justices that were hand picked by the Republican party, and the worst he plans to do if he wins is enact project 2025, the platform developed not by Trump but by the Republican party.

What we really have to do is to end the KGB/FSB as a force in American politics. There has to be a way to do this. Possibly the best way to do this is to not just sanction Russia, but to put the entire country into receivership. An appropriate degree of reparations for the damage Russia has done to the land and cities of Ukraine would probably be, 80% of all international oil revenue from Russia for the next 50 years, goes to Ukraine. If the country is in receivership and the distribution is honest, after paying the expenses of production, the rest distributed to the Russian people will leave them far better off than they are under Putin.

"We seem to be oblivious to how bad this will get.  The 2020 plan of pressuring Congress not to certify on 1/6 didn‚Äôt work then, and definitely wouldn‚Äôt work now.

But what was workshopped and ‚Äútest flown‚Äù in 2020 and 2022 were various other ways of preempting the election.

Between the start of vote counting around 11/5 and receipt of state electoral certificates on 12/25, the plan is openly to intercept and prevent the transmission and receipt of the certificates in DC‚Ä¶

That means three options‚Ä¶

1. ***Certificate Transmission/Receipt:*** Simply preventing the certificate from being sent, therefore taking a blue state‚Äôs electors out of the mix, thus reducing the 270 threshold.

2. ***Certification:*** Convincing local/regional election judges to declare some part of the process invalid.  This will involve threats and acts of violence against them and their families, direct attacks on or bombing of storage locations, burning ballot drop boxes, etc.

3. ***Legislative Preemption:*** Convincing the state legislatures that they have a constitutional right to appoint the states electors in the manor of their choosing, and nowhere in federal law or the constitution does it say they can‚Äôt simply disregard the vote.  This has sort of been tested before SCOTUS on related topics like gerrymandering.

All three of these approaches have been tested, all three are *openly* talked about.  I think our next ‚Äú1/6‚Äù is now just a few days away from starting, not two months.

The coming investigation and the number of trials and convictions that will flow from 11/5 through 12/25 will likely dwarf 1/6/20 by an order of magnitude.  Instead of 2,000 prosecutions that have taken 4 years, we‚Äôll be facing 20,000 or more prosecutions.  We‚Äôll have to come up with a way to have 10x or more prosecutors, more judges, more investigators, etc or the cases will all just time out under statutes of limitations.

Or, Trump wins and the prosecution of political enemies begins instead.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"Don't be discouraged, vote. Biden and Harris are already aware of impending antics and already have detailed plans to mitigate them.

Just remember that Trump is NOT the president; he is a private citizen. He was the leader of the United States and he still ended up out on his ass after losing in 2020. He does not have the power that he once did and is not directly in charge of the system and its levers of power.

*Why* do you think he looks so goddamn depressed? *Why* do you think he's whining about how ""he should never have left the White House?"" Big change from the smug asshole bragging at MSG about his secret with the traitorous Mike Johnson.

He probably found out that not only is he going to lose bigly tomorrow, but he will not have the numbers in Congress necessary to force any last minute shenanigans. In other words, when everyone turns out in force and hands Harris a decisive win, even if he screams about how the race was stolen, there is a good chance that the GOP cowards will leave him out to dry.

He knows he's finished. And his cult members are going down with him.

Then they mail those in on deadline day with the expectation that officials would be too busy to double check, and then when the dubious names appear on the voter's rolls, they request ballots, and fraud occurs.

My guess is based on what happened in the 2020 election in Muskegon, Michigan, when a Democrat-funded group dropped off thousands of fake registrations in ONE DAY at the Clerk's office with the same handwriting, counterfeit signatures, made-up addresses, etc. The FBI is still investigating, aka covering it up.

The fact that these things are being caught & announced BEFORE the election is very good news.""

What I will never understand with these garbage people is that if you hate democracy *that* much, why even go through the charade of having elections in the first place? Why not have your fucking little coup today? Or a year ago? Apparently, these babies are so emotionally immature and developmentally stunted that they would rather shit on the votes of tens of millions of their own fellow citizen than accept a reality in which they have lost. *That's* what they learned from their decrepit narcissist of a cult leader. That it's only ever ""me, me, me"" without any regard for other people. And I'm sorry to say that it's my own generation (Gen X) and older who seem to be the worst at accepting that sometimes the world isn't how you want it to be and that you have to fucking live with it. Those are the generations who originally came up with the concept of ""participation trophies"" and it shows. Fuck these people. In politics, you win by making your arguments in a way that brings more people on board and convinces them to vote for you. It's bad enough how many people are so intellectually stupid to be lured in by that orange rat-catcher of Hamelin, but to openly come out and say that even if your fellow Americans don't follow along and vote him into office you will just straight-up ignore them and make him President anyway, is the height of selfishness and egocentrism.

Here in the UK, we have only just come out of 14 years of a conservative government. I hated every moment of those 14 years. But not in my wildest dreams would I have expected my preferred party to just being ""instated"" into government by shenanigans if they didn't have the votes.

https://newrepublic.com/article/187847/donald-trump-fellatio-microphone-rally

‚Äúwoke up Saturday morning, as you may have, to the sight of Donald Trump performing fellatio on a microphone (no, I‚Äôm not linking to it). The clip that was making the rounds on X was 27 seconds. As I scrolled down, I noticed a tweet from a MAGA person scolding the non-MAGA world and offering a clip that ran to about two minutes. This ‚Äúcontext,‚Äù this person suggested, would explain why he did this and prove once again how diabolically slanted the media was, and how unfair the world was to Trump.

I watched the longer version. Um, news flash: The ‚Äúcontext‚Äù didn‚Äôt help. His mic went out. Someone handed him another one. He griped about his mic for a while. He held the working mic at his side and started to speak, I suppose demonstrating what it was like to be standing on a stage speaking without being heard, when suddenly he did that ‚Ä¶ thing he did.

So no, there is no context. There‚Äôs no conceivable explanation that would leave us thinking, ‚ÄúOh, OK, sure, so that‚Äôs why he emulated a blow job. Who among us wouldn‚Äôt?‚Äù",2024_11_05,05_45_33

> A poll from Emerson College and The Hill released Monday shows Trump up by 1 percentage point, while The Hill/Decision Desk HQ&#039;s polling averages find Trump leading Harris by just half a point.

"My take on this as a person who despises Trump:

At least from the documentaries I have seen on Epstein, he is an extreme sociopath. This audio isn't too reliable as a result. I fully get that he understands Trump and how he operates, but I would not put it past Epstein to make up stories about him to jab at him since they had a falling out. The things he is describing are things that he imagines going on, since that is how he operated when they were close.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"Hunter's laptop supposedly had some email on it where Hunter was setting up a meeting between a Burisma exec and ""The Big Guy"" which was (to the right) proof that Joe Biden was part of some shady deal with Burisma while vice president. This conspiracy theory (about Biden and Burisma) is why Trump was impeached the first time. He threatened to withhold funds from Ukraine if they didn't investigate Joe's dealings with Burisma. So basically, the whole thing was an attempt to discredit the first impeachment of Trump, and also find anything to impeach Biden for. This is also where the Russian asset that called into the FBI anonymously to report Biden dealings with Burisma just so they could get it on the record that someone told the FBI something.

There was some emails in there about him being a consultant where he made gobs of money to connect people to help businesses with problems, which is often what a consultant does. He was paid an awful lot, but he also is very connected, the crux of the issue MAGAs have.

The part that really gets to me about this is that, on the books, the USA spent around $67 million directly on Trump properties(lodging/food/etc) during the Trump presidency. To my knowledge that $67 million is more than the living members of the Bidens families worth combined. So Joe sold influence while he could have gained partnership with a country club and made the exact same money, legally.

"I'm not saying that women should be trapped in unloving marriages, in fact I think if the love is gone, the parties should split to be happier apart.

However, I had this used against me by my wife. We were together fo 10yrs, married for 3. She just checked out and decided she wanted to leave one day, never decided to tell me.

There is an extremely insidious, poisonus and corrosive element to this that people seem to be missing. I am all for empowerment of women, allowing them agency over their lives an bodies.

The unfortunate side effect is that men are disposable and worthless now, because these women see no need to treat men with respect anymore. I'm not an abuser, I'm not a conservative. I'm a software developer who experienced burnout and then struggled professionally after moving to a new place. I tried my best, I am not the woman controlling mysogynistic terrorist that this article is about. If she wants to leave fine, but explain why! Give some sense of closure! What kind of fucking monster are you if you can just walk away from a decade long relationship like it was nothing?

Marriage isn't some sacred, god divined thing to me. It's a promise between two people. Apparently in 2024 promises don't mean anything anymore, and loyalty is just a fleeting memory.

Giving up isn't the problem. Making a unilateral decision for your marriage, and refusing to even explain why things are happening is disgusting, offensive and disrespectful to a person you spent years with.

Hazard-Order Regulations. Some young adults show an interest in inherently dangerous jobs. Current rules forbid many young people, even if their family is running the business, from working in such jobs. This results in worker shortages in dangerous fields and often discourages otherwise interested young workers from trying the more dangerous job. With parental consent and proper training, certain young adults should be allowed to learn and work in more dangerous occupations. This would give a green light to training programs and build skills in teenagers who may want to work in these fields. l DOL should amend its hazard-order regulations to permit teenage workers access to work in regulated jobs with proper training and parental consent

A *ludicrous* amount of empirical research/study data reveals that children fare better, in myriad ways, when primary custody is granted to the mother. So much evidence, in fact, that family courts don't even consider the matter to be up for debate.


That's not to state this is **absolutely always** the case but the preponderance of evidence shows it is *largely* the case.


What is *best for the children* matters most, regardless of the grumblings of ""anti-mother"" men. Those same men *should be* wanting what is **best** for their children -- not what is best for butthurt egos.

Which parent goes to parent teacher meetings at school? Which parent keeps track of allergies, medicines, social events, etc?

This. The problem I think is that divorce laws in many states are archaic and out of touch with the modern world. The system ought to treat both parties completely equal in the separation. If one person makes 100K and the other makes 50k then both should get 75k for a set period of time (no more than 5 years).

Like maybe make therapy cheaper and more easily accessible for the poorest, make education cheaper and just better quality and available to a larger section of people, make home ownership more attainable, put into policies that ensure more work-life balance, labor law/labor policy reforms.

Couples divorce for so many reasons but I think financial pressures is a big one. Money is the root of all strife-if that issue is resolved, perhaps couples will find it easier to co-exist. And if people are happier, it is easier to see the silver lining of remaining in a marriage.

But Trump/Vance's policies will lead to financial hardship for millions of Americans-likely prolonged hardship which will make life even harder-and in turn marriages harder. Happy couples don't divorce, couples who are struggling at work/in life are likely to have more discord and thereby will choose the option of divorce.

If work or business is thriving, you are making good money, you are able to provide for yourself and your children with ease, enjoy a good standard of life, are able to take breaks/holidays to decompress/have affordable healthcare at your fingertips, what reason would you have to breakup. But removing no-fault divorce to discourage divorces is just backwards thinking! Instead of targeting the cause, you are targeting the consequence.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

Men are granted permission slips to act poorly and blame it on someone else as a get our of jail free card.

Yes that's what correlation analysis is. Now we would want to research the strength of the correlations to give us a good lead for which direction to take our cause and effect research. Though I'm not going deeper into the literature right now, political philosophy is not my specialty, I suspect that the correlation between non-divorced marriage rates in america and mental health in america is stronger and reflects better on the timeline than the correlation between the amount of british colonies and mental health in america.

  
My point is that surely it is not implausible to hypothesize that unbroken marriages are closely linked to societal mental health since the dynamic in which people spend their daily lives are very closely linked to their psychological wellbeing.

The 411 you seek is absolutely there to be found and inform you. Sadly, too many allow their own experience to bias what they *believe* to be reality.


The family courts don't blithely reward primary custody on the foundation of ""we hate fathers"" - or - we mothers.

I'm positing those problems exist, based on the data and observations. Yes, you can consistently claim that a looser family structure, potentially less meaningful marital relationships, declining mental health and the social dynamics that arise from them are not actually a negative thing, but that'll really paint you into an unpleasant corner to defend in normative ethics. But I'm also not here to demean it. If that's your genuine position then I'm happy to talk about it.

""Divorce rates going up might not be a problem. It might just mean that more people in bad marriages have a way to get out of them now, and are able to afford to get out of them.""

They want the poors to die. Its not a coincidence that the rich happen to also be the people who publicly believe in eugenics regardless of political affiliation.

To the rich, they watched the movie ""Elysium"" and thought the protagonist was the bad guy... because that's their ideal state; a society where the rich are physically separated from the poors that remain after human civilization has been dismantled to service them alone (the rich).

They are parasites, actively trying to kill their host and then live off of the rotting corpse; because that's literally the closest way of describing the end game of the ultra-rich; to the rich, the wellbeing of the poor have always been an unfortunate compromise they've had to make to maintain their lifestyle... the moment they do not need to make that compromise, they won't.

You know what brought on the best economic period of human prosperity the world has ever seen here in America?

China's under the same gun with Tiawan. They're creeping up on the ""if we don't do this now, we'll _never_ be able to"" line. They could make some societal changes and _maybe_ try in 2-4 decades, but that's actual work, and ~~Mao~~Xi's gotta cement his legacy before he croaks.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"If you are a rich billionaire with a legion of loyal, truly intelligent robotic slaves, then the robots aren't making products for other human beings to buy.

The robots are making products for only the rich billionaire to consume, as well as to keep the robot ""caste"" running.

You are assuming that if I am a rich, egotistical asshole with an army of robotic slaves, I am going to give you the breadcrumbs and scraps off my table. That is wrong. I will have the robots serve me only and if you try to steal my resources, I'll send the robots to kill you.

Capitalism exists because intelligent labor can only come from human beings, who expect to be compensated for their work, which is why consumers and producers exist. If I have an army of loyal robots, then it's unnecessary for me to pay human labor and to participate in capitalism. The robots will build an entire self-contained economy to serve me only and you can just fuck off. I have already won and I have no need to pay human labor with resources anymore.

This is what the person you're responding to is trying to say.

"Why would they think in the long term? Hell, why would they think in the \*middle\* term?

Every mid-range problem can be mitigated or overcome entirely through money. That's been the way it has worked for them for decades and it's only getting more extreme. They socialize the downsides, and privatize the profits.

If a company they run fails, they own the majority stock, and as the majority stock holder their 'losses' are paid back first, then everyone else. They lose nothing, and the government (ie, you and me, the ones paying for the government) pay for the loss. If they win, they gobble up more of the stock with their preferred stock options and preferred profit shares and then it's all theirs.

Taxes? They run super obvious scams that let them pay nothing, often using those tax write-off's to pay for things for themselves they would have paid for anyway, and then they massively lean on community properties and common goods to maximize their profits. They dump in \*our\* drinking water, on \*our\* land, and in \*our\* air...which isn't near them.

This just continues. Money is a marker, a token, and a lever to maximize their life that they get other people to even run those machinations.

YOU don't factor into it. YOU don't matter to them. YOU aren't even in the consideration.

It doesn't matter if it isn't sustainable because the effects on THEM are buffered over and over and over again until they just can't be buffered any further and then it all collapses.

If the cost of pineapple increases by an order of magnitude then it's the difference between 0.00000001% of their daily profit and 0.0000001% and they don't even notice because they aren't in charge of buying that shit anyway. Someone else is, and they pay \*them\* to think about this shit. They aren't dealing with it. It will matter to them when suddenly you can't buy a pineapple anywhere for any price, and until then, they simply will not care since it just doesn't matter. The same applies across the board to just about every product or problem.   
  
They don't notice the costs or prices, they don't matter. A million dollar super car is as expensive to them as a hamburger is to you and \*less\* important to their budget. The things that actually cost money (companies, large scale projects, etc etc) are all things that they simply use the \*leverage\* of their money over...they don't actually \*pay\* for that shit.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

Those people are either so detached from humanity that they can't fathom any kind of interaction with the plebs that doesn't involve them having absolute control or they're actually *very aware* of how likely it is for said plebs to murder them the moment the societal foundations that gave the rich their power crumble away.

If we retain control of government we can eventually nationalize their operation and produce goods free of charge and everyone can live at least with a basic amount of wealth.  We will need government to step in like this at some point as end stage capitalism just doesn't work.

Trump is simply the figurehead for a much larger, longer-term issue. The idea that we can have an experienced, level-headed, multiracial history-making candidate who is backed by nearly every celebrity of note on both sides of the aisle and run a nearly flawless (though short) campaign... and yet still be neck-and-neck with a microphone-fellating elderly criminal means the problem isn't Trump, it's like... half the american people who agree with his views and his message.

Even if he goes away, what do people expect for the next election? The republicans will put another extreme right candidate up, probably a smoother talking one who's more outwardly palatable to the independent voters. The novelty of a female president will have worn off and the urgency that stems from ""Trump the Enemy"" will be gone, making it a challenge for Harris's re-election. Fear and division will still be effective republican strategies. The man will be gone, but everything else about the MAGA folks will still be around and more strategic than ever.

I have no idea what the plan is to change the minds that need to be changed. I don't know how to get people to stop caring about trans bathrooms, or equating immigrants with crime. I'm not sure how we as a nation can get to a place where presidential elections are about boring policy disagreements and not have one side radically trying its best to dismantle democracy.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"While this is going to be unfortunately true, I think Trump himself was an important part of making it have such a resurgence. Like people seem to forget that prior to his first term(and even during it) he was very charismatic, funny to listen to, and just generally a really good candidate in a ""Lets troll shit"" sorta way. And coming against so many kinda blah bureaucrats he had a novelty that really propelled him with Independents. However pretty quickly he butted heads with the moderate and established people he had on his team, got rid of them, and RAPIDLY took a turn towards ever darker extremes of the Conservative side, and all of this before his clear cognitive decline, and the overwhelming bitterness that consumed him after the Election loss and his cornucopia of felonies in an attempt to keep power. But without Trump as a lightening rod, i don't see anyone with the personality to herd the roiling mass of Right wing groups.

">What scares me even more is where we would be if Roe v. Wade never happened. There's been so much talk about how women are out to vote because of it, but is there so much voter apathy that we would be staring down the barrel of another Trump presidency had the Supreme Court not buried Roe v. Wade?

Quite possibly. People are generally far more motivated by being personally impacted at an existential level. What was driving a lot of the culture war in the late sixties and early seventies was the draft and Vietnam. As soon as we got out of Vietnam and successfully deposed a President the wind left the sails of 'the Movement'. Nixon had been duly punished by 'the people' and no one was being personally threatened by the possibility of being drafted and sent to Vietnam to die in the jungles for some abstract idea like ""making the world safe for democracy"". 

The thing about abortion is that it's as existential for women as Vietnam was for men. It's a decision that no woman comes to lightly. They may not like abortion and they may not want to abort but they see no other choice under the circumstances (circumstances that are almost totally a result of external pressures). The freedom to choose was always there if you had to resort to. Publically you could say how awful it is etc but it's still a safety valve if you need it. And it has been there for 50 years. Generations of women have grown up assuming that the right to choose will be there if they need it.

Let's say you're the judge and you've decided he's going to prison. You can choose to announce this before or after the election. After is a better look.

Also, it lets him hedge his bets. Trump loses, easier to give him the punishment he deserves. Trump wins, honestly, I don't know what the judge would decide.

Trump vilifies immigrants, the LGBTQ community, Black people, Hispanic people, Latin people, Arab people, women, Democrats, muslims, And people of different religions. I would say the only exception, is he doesn‚Äôt have strong opinions about religion. The only reason he doesn‚Äôt inherently, vilify religious beliefs. Is because he doesn‚Äôt know anything about them. He is not a religious man, and he doesn‚Äôt have a clue what is said in the Bible. His moral compass is non existent, but ultimately you have to be a scared person to be a Trump supporter. Trumps helps these people turn their fear into hate, by providing them a target. Everyone is in pain, we all have pain, but how we work through our struggles defines us. By vilifying anyone and everything, he distracts his base with an outlet to direct that pain and fear. That hate stemming from fear, appears to blind them as well, and for some reason allows them to live with one eye open and one eye closed.

"The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.

This paper examines Donald Trump‚Äôs character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America‚Äôs most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington‚Äôs humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln‚Äôs moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump‚Äôs conduct‚Äîboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6th‚Äîreveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump‚Äôs character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.

">Danielle Butterfield, executive director of the Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA

Ok this is a great name for a PAC. 

>none other than Stephen Miller believes that the racist joke at Trump‚Äôs Madison Square Garden rally, which compared Puerto Rico to a pile of garbage, was a ‚Äúhuge unforced error‚Äù 

>Butterfield: A really big difference between people hearing Trump‚Äôs words and Trump‚Äôs allies words in this context is that ***they have a retrospective understanding of not just his words but his actions*** and how the two can be really related to each other. When we heard messaging at the MSG rally last week, there was a really easy ability to then connect that to how he handled certain situations when he was president. ***It‚Äôs not just a flippant joke but a representation of how he actually acted.*** For example, we‚Äôre running an ad right now targeting Puerto Rican voters in partnership with Somos Votantes across the battleground, particularly in Pennsylvania, that really ties together the joke about Puerto Rico being an island of trash up against how Trump handled Hurricane Maria. That ad is testing really well amongst Latino voters, in particular Puerto Rican voters, because it reminds them, and it really contextualizes, ***that this isn‚Äôt just words, it‚Äôs his actions.*** That‚Äôs a really big shift that we‚Äôre seeing this year in terms of our ability to show Trump‚Äôs impact. 

>One other thing that we are seeing is that ***young voters are hearing audio from Trump‚Äôs Billy Bush interview where he said grab them by the p-word‚Äîthey‚Äôre hearing that for the first time this year***, even though it leaked originally in the 2016 cycle. This is really important because these voters who are voting for the first time in 2024 were 10, 11 years old when Trump was first elected in 2016. So when these voters are hearing this horrible sound and this horrible audio interview from Trump with his graphic depiction of how he views women, they‚Äôre hearing it in the context of him being proud of overturning Roe v. Wade. The context of how his words have actually had a disastrous impact, it‚Äôs just landing a lot differently in this cycle.

>It certainly felt good to see that Iowa polls, particularly her numbers with white suburban women and older voters. Even if we don‚Äôt win in Iowa, it‚Äôs a signal that we‚Äôre going to do well in the upper Midwest. It‚Äôs a great sign of what‚Äôs to come for Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. But it doesn‚Äôt change our strategy. Neither of these polls change our strategy at this point, which is that we need to continue to persuade and mobilize these voters in the final stretch. ***The thing that doesn‚Äôt necessarily get reported as much is that we‚Äôre doing it with such joy.*** Seeing all these Harris volunteers out on the doors with their rogue merch that they made at home and their friendship bracelets and having just an amazing back and forth on SNL last night about Harris‚Äôs ability to drive joy in this final stretch. That‚Äôs giving me a lot of hope.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

2. **1988 Election**: He predicted George H. W. Bush‚Äôs victory.

3. **1992 Election**: Lichtman foresaw Bill Clinton‚Äôs win against incumbent George H. W. Bush.

4. **1996 Election**: He successfully predicted Bill Clinton‚Äôs re-election.

5. **2000 Election**: Allan Lichtman predicted Al Gore would win the popular vote, which he did, though George W. Bush became President through the Electoral College.

6. **2004 Election**: Lichtman correctly forecasted George W. Bush‚Äôs re-election.

7. **2008 Election**: He predicted Barack Obama‚Äôs victory.

8. **2012 Election**: Lichtman correctly anticipated Barack Obama‚Äôs second term.

9. **2016 Election**: Lichtman predicted Donald Trump‚Äôs win, a surprising result to many.

"Fingers crossed, but I'm not sure Musk has been all that effective.


He doesn't know his way around a political campaign, and there's a reason most campaigns don't use paid canvassers. He's managed to discredit Twitter as an information source, and his current efforts on it seem to hinge on raising expectations of a Trump victory. That helps with Jansixing more than it does with winning an election.


Not to say that his money won't still go a long way, or that the election isn't close, but Musk is about as good at this as he is at building a working truck.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"Hah.  So want to know what's really going on here?   There's been massive herding towards 50/50 this entire race because nobody wants to put their neck out and be wrong again.  They've been seeing Kamala ahead this whole time, but because of 2016 and 2020, they've been heavily adjusting the sampling and weighting towards the middle. 

Now with the early vote data and the Seltzer poll, they're starting to admit they overdid it.   You're going to see all of the pollsters lurching towards Harris here at the very end, and it's not actually because she's suddenly doing better.  It's because they're taking their thumbs off the scale.

He was only given a month to build it from scratch too, something that typically takes years.¬†¬†


¬†The Republicans have spent whatever money they have to get people to vote early but all that's done is move a ton of their voters from election day to a week or two early.

It just doesn't make sense to me that it could be so even when it feels from the people that Democrats are more motivated than ever, while Republicans are feeling the opposite.

"Two reasons: the media needs a close race to keep people engaged. This is a long known issue and the media has consistently tweaked large national polls this way (if the sample has a disproportionate number of D v R, they will skew the numbers to match the population). This dilutes independent voters who actually make up about 1/3 of the voting population. Independents almost always end up favoring one candidate over another and this gets factored out in these polls. The second reason which is unique to the last two cycles is that Republicans and Trump have spent millions on public polls (polls where the results are released to the public) to shift the polling in their favor by a few points. This is why there was a Red Mirage in 2022 and Republicans had a historically bad year. Trump alone has spent millions on these polls this year and more than half the swing state polls consumed by 538 are polls he paid for.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"There is a well established, symbiotic relationship between politicians, pollsters, and the media. 

Some of it is that, for both sides, there is an incentive to cook the numbers to make it appear as a close race, because it keeps voter motivation and engagement high, regardless of what their internal data actually suggests. Like you said. That‚Äôs probably one of the biggest parts. 

Another group is the other ones you mentioned, the ones who don‚Äôt want to look bad or lose credibility by making a bold prediction and being wrong. They would rather make generic predictions in line with what everyone else is saying, even if they end up being wrong, because it doesn‚Äôt hurt them so much when literally everyone got it wrong. 

Really though, there is little incentive for anyone involved to tell the actual truth of what their data is telling them unless their candidate is already almost a certain bet and they believe that they are close enough to the election that opinion and outcome aren‚Äôt likely to change. 

That‚Äôs why we are suddenly seeing all the last minute polls agree on this ‚Äòout-of-the-blue‚Äô surge for Harris. It doesn‚Äôt matter anymore, because Trump is fucked and nothing will change that. And, even if that did change, and he won, the numbers wouldn‚Äôt really make any sense because they were already bs anyways. They‚Äôd just come out and say that it was a crazy fluke no one could have predicted. 

Basically, a lot of how they make their decisions is based on two general things: partisan strategy‚Ä¶ and maintaining their own credibility, with the latter usually being the priority.

The Dems on the other hand have been crisscrossing the entire city of the suburbs and the entire state with targeted lists and thoughtful GOTV efforts.  

Democrats from all over the eastern seaboard have been pouring into Pennsylvania to help out because it‚Äôs easy to get to and it‚Äôs important. Equally importantly is that the PA Dems have been putting them to use when they‚Äôre here and not just letting them sit on their thumbs.

Folks have come from overseas, including the manager of the Northwest Philadelphia campaign office who has lived in London for 30 years and told me it was too important to not let this get fucked up so she came back to work this last one.

Is this dispositive question who knows but we are cautiously nauseously optimistic here in RoxYunk.

All these questions from journalists to congress critters in the form of ""will you certify"" are little more than rage bait and are about as appropriate as asking your local dogcatcher whether they will certify the election.

What folk in Congress *can* do is object to the electoral votes from a given state.  But the relevant law was updated in 2022.  The threshold to maintain such an objection was raised significantly and the process for such objections were tightened immensely.  There is little to fear here.

The article you linked provides ample meat for those who must get their fix on fear.  But what it suggests is that the law does not matter because people will simply sue to overturn it.  The antidote here is to reflect upon the success ratio of Team Trump in the courts as it pertains to this sort of nonsense of the Big Lie.

"this article by Nate Silver, who has been very bullish for Trump this year is a good start in general for explaining the unprecedented degree of herding we've been seeing, along with a good explanation of what herding is and why it happens.

https://www.natesilver.net/p/theres-more-herding-in-swing-state

The remainder, unfortunately, requires quite a bit of digging, but I'll explain my methodology if you want to repeat it.   The first thing to do is look at the demographic makeup of the early vote we're seeing coupled with earlier surveys of what groups of people are saying they are voting on election day vs early.  

Then with that data in hand, compare that to the sampling methodology of the likely voter models used by the Seltzer poll versus some of the other more credible pollsters like Emerson, Ipsos, and NYT/Sienna.    

What you'll see is that in these polls, their turnout models have two problems that have been addressed in the Seltzer poll.  One is that they haven't updated them a great deal since Biden was in the race, and I think you'd agree that Kamala is going to turn out more and different people than Biden would have.   And it's also becoming increasingly clear that the likely voter models they are using are hugely underestimating the gender gap we're going to see in the actual voting.  They're assuming the average 4-6% higher female vote that we saw in 2020 instead of the 10-12% we're actually seeing be the case.  I'm betting they're also very much  undercounting the African American vote, but I don't have as solid data on that.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Yep, I call it ""Pulling a Rasmussen""",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"according to my understanding half of the polls out there are conducted by right leaning pollsters. Like Nate Silver said, the Iowa poll doesn't change anything, because right after that was released there's another new poll that shows Trump is winning Iowa.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Yeah, I get it.  You can't swing a cat without hitting a conflicting analysis of the polls lately here.   Really, the only thing you can do is not take ANY of it very seriously right now.  The polls will either be right or they'll be wrong. And if they're wrong, it will either be in Trump's favor or Kamala's. 

And in either case, at this point the results will be what the results will be.  Vote if you haven't, get others to vote if you can.  But otherwise,  just take care of yourself and see how things turn out, and stay safe.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"So, is there a point attached to that link?  Mine is that the data you just linked is heavily skewed. 

Though actually it's also impacted by a whole other problem I haven't discussed above, which is that right wing pollsters have been flooding the zone with garbage polls favorable to Trump in order to shift the polling averages and control the narrative.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Really, I think the most persuasive one is this from Nate Silver three days ago.  It doesn't make the strongest case of those available, but the fact that it's coming from someone who's been extremely bullish on Trump all year lends it weight in my opinion because you can't claim he's biased for Kamala.  https://www.natesilver.net/p/theres-more-herding-in-swing-state",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Really, I think that the short takeaway from all of this is that there are so many confounding factors that it's probably nearly impossible to build a halfway decent likely voter model at all.  

 * 2020 data is jacked as a baseline because of Covid, but it's all they really have to work with.  

 * The Dobbs decision is obviously going to do 'something' but it's pretty difficult to estimate how much that would impact female turnout and cross over vote, but both are critical. 

 * There's the unprecedented political earthquake of the Democratic candidate being replaced mid-race, and that person would be the first Woman President in an election that's all about women's rights...

 * We have a Republican candidate that is running with 34 felony convictions and multiple other felony court cases hanging over his head.

 * We have the first Presidential election since the failed January 6th attempt to overthrow our government.

I think most of the people who voted for the first time for Trump in 16 or 20, and those who did their second trump vote in 20, are just done trying. they thought they were saving the country and they're not motivated the same way any more.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

BUT, there's a huge caveat. A sample size of two is *nothing*. Polls also significantly overestimated Republican advantage in the 2022 midterms. The tendency toward ""herding"" toward the middle is in part a reaction by pollsters to try and shore up the data they might have missed in the last two races.

But on the side of both of those parades I saw a bunch of people flipping them off, ignoring them, laughing at them, making comments about how sick we are of them.

I understand that, but if you remember, in 2020 the numbers for early voting heavily favored democrats and the republicans swamped the democrats on Election Day voting. There are groups that are more likely to vote early and groups that are more likely to vote on Election Day, so to look at the part of the data we have so far, it isn‚Äôt just a clean representative sample of the final voting demographics. It‚Äôs quite possible that the democrats and women have done a majority of their voting early and the majority of the republicans and men waited until Election Day.

Covid's also not really a factor this year, which really drove up Democratic mail in voting I think (after all Republican's didn't believe Covid was a big deal).

"This is purposeful. It's called the Firehose of Falsehood. There's always some scandal and those scandals have varying levels of factuality and seriousness. The very factual and very serious scandals, such as Trump's use of Nazi-adjacent rhetoric, get drowned out by unfactual and/or unserious scandals, such as Trump looking like a buffoon in a garbage truck.

This tactic makes it very hard for the electorate to parse what they should and shouldn't be paying attention to, as well as making the public disengage from politics entirely because of exhaustion - Allowing leaders to ignore their needs. The Firehose has most prominently been used by Putin to seize control of Russia and turn it into an authoritarian oligarchy.

"I've heard that the reason for his weird orangey hair color is that he uses this blonde hair dye, but he's too impatient to sit and let it fully activate, so he throws it on and then takes it off too soon, leaving it this weird color that's sometimes blonde and other times it's this orangey blonde.  

I'd imagine that's the same issue with his makeup, he's just smearing fake tan onto his face, and since he's terrified he's going to lose and go to jail, he's rushing everything.  He's running to get to his rallies hours late, smearing fake tan and then not checking if it's too much etc.  

You're watching him fall apart, the last time he was this panicked was when he was doing those rallies like [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/trump-looks-like-loser/613363/) where he was so depressed that he was going to lose that he let the veil fall.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

Like a constant state of melting is how I would describe Trump's face at any given moment in time. Is he just shit at taking care of his skin, is so pockmarked that he has to pile it on so people can't see how damaged his skin really is, is an especially sweaty, sweaty guy that no amount of setting powder helps-because really why does he ALWAYS look so bad.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"Also, this strategy tends to amplify wrongdoing on the Democratic side too. Trump had a thousand things that would've disqualified any other candidate. With Hillary it was her emails. The news media, so to avoid looking bias had to talk about something negative with her too. The only thing they could hammer her on was ""Buttery Males"". So while they were constantly reporting on some new scandal on Trump...they had to constantly go back to Hillary's emails....making it seem like the worst thing in the world.

Its why Biden stepping out was brilliant. The only thing he could be hammered on was ""being old"". Well he stepped out and it caught the GOP completely out of sorts, they hadn't had time to find the one negative about Kamala that would stick in the mind of voters.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"I think, for some meaningful number of voters, it took several cycles of the Republican drumbeat over ""corrupt, evil Democrats"" to finally realize that it's all a farce. And there's clearly a growing contingent of voters tired of the Republican scare tactics about LGBTQ people or people who use ""they/them"" pronouns. I'd wager a lot of libertarian-leaning Republicans outright don't care and don't think government officials should be regulating how people identify.

And every time Trump brings up RFK Jr. to lead the FDA or CDC, Hershel Walker to lead missile defense, and every other kook and extremist in charge of serious government entities that people (still) trust and rely on, they finally realize and accept that Democrats aren't exaggerating when they say Trump is the existential threat to democracy and functional government that they've been screaming from the rooftops for nearly a decade now.

The big spotlight on Project 2025 and the timing of it probably helped more than any other singular campaign message from the Dems, IMO. I think there's a large enough contingent of moderate and right-leaning folks who reliably voted Republican in the past, but aren't necessarily on board with dismantling NOAA and NWS, banning contraception, or having the government monitor or track pregnancies.

"It is a dynastic order:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynastic_order

A dynastic order, monarchical order, or house order is an order under royal patronage. Such an order is bestowed by, as a legitimate fons honorum, a sovereign or the head of a once-sovereign ruling family.

Dynastic orders are under the exclusive control of a monarch

The title is given by Prince Pedro and Prince Carlo. Quite literally **Princes** with ties of fealty to the Pope. Meaning that if you are a knight of this order you are a subject of the Vatican. Not just a ""catholic"" as many are trying to play this off as.

It is not an order of chivalry under the patronage of the Holy See HOWEVER the Italian Republic recognises the order as an Order of Chivalry under Law n¬∞ 178 of 1951, meaning this title **is also recognized by Italy.**

If I was American I would be going ballistic if a judge in the highest court in the land was gifting patronage to McDonalds let alone the Pope, Italy, or some former nation. Judges must be informal, yet here they are playing fucking dress up and kneeling to Dukes.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"There‚Äôs two branches of the order, one headed by the House of Bourbon-Parma and one by the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies which has two rival claimants. They are dynastic orders so each order can only be led by the head of each dynasty. 

The titles they use are Italian titles and those were legally extinguished after Italy became a republic so they might just be commoners who call themselves ‚Äúprince‚Äù and ‚Äúduke‚Äù.  There are quite a few of these pretenders in Europe but there are quite a few of those in the US too. It‚Äôs a bit doubtful whether they qualify for the purposes of the Titles of Nobility Clause. They are also princes of two states, the Kingdom of the Two Scillies and the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza, that were abolished back in the 1800s due to getting annexed during Italian unification. 

It seems Carlos, Duke of Parma is legally a noble due to being part of the Dutch royal family with the legal title Prince Carlos de Bourbon de Parme. But it looks like both claimants to the head of the other branch of the order are both legally commoners who just use ‚Äúcustomary titles‚Äù.

You cannot serve as a federal official while simultaneously tied to another government or similar or connected organization.  Mixed loyalties are explicitly not permitted.  
  
In this case, we have a Catholic organization (under the Vatican, a foreign power) administered by a person with a title of nobility (a Prince with an inherited Ducal domain, ceremonial nature of his title notwithstanding).

So your argument is that Joe Biden and 30% of Congress deserve impeachment and/ or prison for being Catholic?,2024_11_05,05_45_33
"If we go with Alito's originalist/textualist mode of thinking then, sadly, this isn't a hard argument to rebut. The word ""Prince"" in the clause doesn't mean people with the literal title of ""Prince"", it's the legal shorthand for a monarch of somekind, generally one who is not fully sovereign but has a liege with some sovereign power over them, like the various counts, grafs, dukes, etc of the Holy Roman Empire at the time the constitution was written. The context of placing it alongside ""King"" and ""Foreign State"" shows the intention is to ban receiving titles from a sovereign power, whether monarchy or not, with whom the government would have relations as a foreign state. The House of Bourbon Two-Sicilies has not been a ruling royal house since the 1860s, and the state that gave them their name died with their rule, and if we accept that Papal sponsorship of the order satisfies that criteria then we have to interrogate a number of Catholic officials of the US government, including numerous ambassadors, who have accepted membership in various other papal orders, including Bill Donovan (head of the WWII O.S.S), and multiple US Ambassadors to the Holy See. 

Beyond that there is the debate whether being offered membership in a chivalric order is the same as being offered a 'title' because it confers no differentiated legal rights or privileges, excepting perhaps the fancy cosplay.

Beyond a shadow of a doubt Alito accepting this 'honour' violates the spirit of the clause about public officials accepting baubles, honours, and trappings that undermine public confidence in their credentials to serve as leaders of a free people in a republican state, but the method for determining that is a more arduous impeachment proceeding looking at all their conduct. Alito should undergo that process for numerous flagrant displays that he has no care for that confidence, but he can't be hung on the word ""Prince"" alone.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

...What? Do you know what originalists believe? I have no idea how you came to this conclusion. Textualism is - and I cannot stress this enough - the belief that the document should be read by its ***LITERAL MEANING.*** Originalists believe that the Constitution is not open to interpretation in the way you've described. What you are describing is intentionalism, literally the exact diametric platonic opposite of originalism. The modes of belief actually by definition cannot be more opposed to one another.

If you're saying that that verbal and logical diarrhea might come out of *Alito's* mouth because he's openly corrupt, then sure. But that would be a total capitulation of his originalist ideals, because again, you literally cannot be an originalist and an intentionalist at the same time, those Constitutional schools of thought are 100% opposed.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"And, as a textualist, Alito would point out that the statues of the Order specify that the ""Merit"" division of the order is explicitly for ""commoners"", and that there are *separate* divisions for nobility, so that he is not being elevated with a title of nobility, far from it, he's explicitly being honoured as a 'common citizen'. Moreover the 'plain meaning' of ""Prince"" at the time of the constitution was ""sovereign ruler"", which the Bourbon Two-Sicilies are not, far from it, they can't even agree which of their number *would be* based on the laws of their own royal house.

All this is to say that there isn't ""true textualism"", because constitutions aren't mathematical formulae in which everything has a meaning that is exactly fungible person to person. They capture and attempt to enshrine a particular imagining of the way that government should work, or can work. It's always worth remembering that any way of working envisioned by a constitution is also a way government could work without it by mutual understanding and agreement. Constitutions are written because the imagined ideal, however imperfect in execution, is held to be more important than necesseities of moment that might demand compromises in that vision to achieve a specific policy objective. Put simply ""it's better we have freedom of speech than to have anything we could get more quickly by sacrificing it"", is a founding principle of America.

Textualism is nothing more or less than a political project to provide a veneer of the inevitable and sacred to contemporary conservatism by making its objectives appear to be the intended fulfillment of that vision. If the broad mass of the people accept that reasoning then it follows that to question their objectives is to question the national project of America, which is a trap Democrats fall into constantly. It's core principle is that in saying ""it's better we have freedom of speech than to have anything we could get more quickly by sacrificing it"" we are not being appropriately specific, we should say something like ""it's better we have freedom of speech *(defining ""freedom of speech"" according to an arbitrary external rule for defining words) than to have anything we could get more quickly by sacrificing *(defining ""sacrificing"" according to an arbitrary external rule for defining words) it"". 

In a sense it's a clever trick, because the debate becomes about the 'arbitrary external rule' and justifying which one to rely on, but that rule is not, in itself, a question that any case or law will touch on directly, so there's no 'precedent' concerning the specific rule, just on whether or not to use a rule at all. Therefore conservatives can rely on the same rhetoric and semantics to get an outcome they've decided they want, even if it's entirely at odds with how they reasoned the semantics of comparable cases before. You can see this in the move to reasoning from ""historical traditions"" in overturning Roe, which was the same line they rejected when it was employed to argue in favour of gun control by pointing out the militia context in the plain text of the second amendment.

All this is to say that there are a huge number of ineffective arguments to employ against Alito and his methodology, and inconsistency is amongst them. Far better to go straight for the jugular and point out you have, amongst the highest justices in the land, the people who should most carefully arbitrate in the interests of the people as a whole and the republican vision of the nation,  a man who thinks his job is to play clever word games. He decides life and death on which dictionary gives him a definition he likes.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"This is a nationwide poll, so not really worth much since the election is state dependent.  However, couple interesting trends

* More Republicans are defecting from Trump.  Typically People vote their party 95% of the time with 5% going to the other candidate.  Here for Republican it is 91%.  That is pretty high defection rate (9%).  Republicans do not tend to vote 3rd party.  

* Per this poll it is Republican *men* with the higher defection rate.  This election it has been leaning women.  Would be nice to have this broken more out by Region and Area to see where these Republican Voters going Democrat are coming from

* Black rate is 83%.  Nope - don't believe it.  That demographic will vote 90%+ for the Democrat.  (Black women 93-98% democrat and Black men 81-90% with Black Women voting more).  Telling me the first black women is getting that low ? Nope.  

* Under 35 split seems low.  Biden won this by 24pts.  Harris only at 13%.

(The other poster who pointed out that the bell-curve extends beyond the edges of the MoE is also correct.)

However, one key thing to remember is that MoE \*only\* measures random sampling error, and assumes that the sample drawn reflects a perfectly random sample (like drawing marbles out of a bag). MoE was a really useful measurement back in the days when survey response rates were over 50%, because a poll behaved a lot like a random sample. Now, it's much less useful because response rates are so low and likely non-representative. Pollsters have attempted to correct for low response rates by ensuring that their their samples demographically fit what they think turnout will be (using quotas to make sure their survey fits the electorate, and/or adjusting the weights of different demographics after). However, this process can be prone to error because it relies on pollsters making assumptions about turnout. MoE does not at all address errors from assumptions made about turnout, or non-representative samples.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"No, it doesn't work like that.

The shape is a bell curve, yes, but the probability doesn't decrease in the way you think.

What's missing from the MOE when people mention it is the corresponding confidence interval. The MOE doesn't mean that the result is *absolutely* within those margins. It means that that the MOE range contains the true result with the confidence level given.

So a 95% CI with a 60 +/- 3% MOE, means that there's a 95% chance that the true result is within 57 to 63.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

There are multiple ways to cut the polling data that show that the numbers we're seeing indicating a very close race for president in the battleground states are incompatible with what we know about voting patterns. The example vantage gives is that historically Senate and Presidential voting are highly correlated, and polling has historically reflected that, but this year the Presidential polling is completely uncorrelated to the Senate polling.

We're also seeing massive turnout pretty much everywhere, which historically is good for Dems, and the GOP has outsourced their canvassing to paid groups which are imploding.

"Nate Silver makes no sense. He's only aggregating polls and calculating the outcome based on those polls, then he writes a whole thing about how the polls can't possibly be right. Makes zero sense. So I just take it as the polls are useless (which is what the polls say anyway, because they all point almost exactly to a coin flip) and look at everything else going on.

She has a ton of enthusiasm, Roe v Wade is driving women to the polls, her rallies are huge, she's a very likeable person, she has no scandals, she broke him at the debate (and the polls didn't budge, more evidence that they're missing something) and the economy has turned the corner. She's promising to give republicans a seat at the table after a decade of exhausting divisiveness. When she gives a big speech, you can actually envision an America that could survive all this petty nonsense we've been through. Republicans are endorsing her left and right. 

Trump, otoh is driving around in garbage trucks while Puerto Ricans are still pissed about being called a floating pile of garbage, he's musing about killing liz cheney, talking about sending the military after citizens, people are leaving his rallies, his rallies are small, camera operators are making him look silly, he's mirroring famous nazi rallies at MSG, cracking jokes about the media getting shot, calling America a garbage can, basically doing the opposite of what he'd do if he were taking this seriously. He's riling up the people who already like him and shitting on virtually every other group of people. His own VP isn't endorsing him and his cabinet is screaming from the mountaintops that he's an insane person.

My gut says I'm like 70% sure she's going to win. The only problem is that 30% represents basically the end of humanity so it's difficult to not be anxious.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
">¬†but I am still discovering people I have always found to be reasonable individuals voting for Trump.¬†

I live in Ohio and I experience this every day.   Friends of ours who also have kids and do all of the same things we do.  When I learn they are voting for Trump I am floored. 

I'm not sure if these people know the real gravity of Trump.  They don't watch the news and they don't do the research.  They haven't even heard many of the horrible things he has said, such as using the military to clean out Portland or remove 15 million people from this country.  My own wife hadn't heard these things until yesterday and she lives with me.   

When they do hear these things, they don't believe it.  They really believe it is just the media and democrats attacking him.  He didn't actually say those things, he didn't actually assault those women, he didn't actually commit those crimes.  Some people have heard the things he said, but don't believe he'd actually do it.   They believe he just rants a lot about the same things people care about.

Meanwhile, they're paying an extra spicey amount for groceries and services.   I bought a few bags of groceries over the weekend and paid $150.  

Woke also seems pretty offensive to straight white people living in the rural and the burbs.  The GOP literally has people scared that LGBT is coming for their children.  In Ohio, the abortion issue is off of peoples minds because we put protections into our constitution so people just aren't worried about it and don't believe a national ban would happen.

"Its not just hit his celling, Trump has always had his highest totals with uneducated older white men.

About 25% of men born in 1946, like Trump, who were alive in 2016 are dead. Its simple demographics. This isn't including covid numbers, this is straight up actuary tables.

Trump has some new blood, but young voters are unpredictable, and I'm thinking older women who are pissed are going to outnumber 22 year old incels in actually voting. (many stories of older women who are voting for the first time as their husbands die off too)

Another thing has been both enthusiasm and get out the vote efforts.

Trump took over the RNC, sucked money from the RNC and downballot to his coffers, and then mostly took that money and used it for things like his lawsuits. For a number of traditional tasks like Get-out-the-vote efforts, he's outsourced from volunteers to paid companies via PACs like the one Elon Musk runs. As every article has come out about, these have been horrendously managed, and are being run on the cheap without any passion. 

Compare the Harris effort, which is much more organic. In a close election, ensuring voters come out is far more important than nearly anything else. A few models suggest in 2016 that rain in a few key locations probably depressed turnout sufficiently enough to make a difference. 

Lastly, unlike 2016, its no longer rhetoric to say if Republicans Win, Abortion gets taken away. It happened. And it's caused democrats to consistently overshoot. 

The polling numbers are mostly funny because they're trying to hedge against hidden trumpers like 2016 and 2020 to appear credible, but that means putting a finger on the scale. This is in addition to a lot of FUD polls designed to either manipulate perceptions or support later nonsense which have questionable methodology.

His recent thing about herding was a response to speculation about whether the polls were off. As there's multiple signs of weirdness. 

Silver was hardly the first to point it out. 

And Herding isn't even the primary thing going on. Most polling orgs are correcting their samples using recall votes. 

A process generally known to be bad. But justified here as a way to compensate for under sampling Trump voters in the last two elections. 

Effectively it's a method of reverting your samples and results to the 2020 results. 

For every election prior to this it's been a bad move. And would have made the polls less accurate. 

Herding likely explains the lack of movement in the polls.

"Nate is fine.  His model does more than aggregate polls, but there is a clear problem with garbage in, garbage out.  His concern that pollsters are herding is also a concern that his model may not be accurate.  Earlier in the cycle, other factors have more weight in his model.  For instance, if a candidate gets a bounce from a convention (or doesn't) has a much larger impact on the probability of winning the model spits out than poll results themselves.  Economic indicators are also more heavily weighted earlier in the cycle. As we approach election day, the polls take on more and more weight.

Nate's very careful to avoid vibes and gut feelings. . .or at least to keep them separate from his forecasts.  Vibes and gut feelings aren't data and so there's not much a model can do with them. And they could be wrong. 

That said, I agree with most of what you've said and think Harris will win it.  Selzer is what really sold me this weekend.  Even if Selzer is REALLY wrong and Trump is actually +5 in Iowa, she's likely won the rust belt. I also feel like there is more enthusiasm from her side and the MSG puerto rico is garbage stuff I think will ultimately prove to have a tangible effect. 

At the end of the day, I think she wins the Rust belt by 1-2 points.  Pollsters will be able to say ""See, we were right!"" with their herded results and everyone will declare polling is fixed.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

One thing that irks me about polling is the accounting for hidden trumpers. How do you factor in a variable you can't know the number of? Adjusting data to try to make it fit a target literally makes it biased and irrelevant no matter which way that skew tilts. You take the data you have and report it, that's it. It shouldn't be any different from any other survey.¬†I think polling is falling victim to what I call the stock market effect, where it's a simple concept that's made to sound more complicated than it is by the people that profit from it.

"All true but there is so much angst over inflation that this could have been baked in since 2020. Not speaking more directly to those concerns and separating from Biden, I fear is a bigger deal than dems want to accept.

Immigration is also something dems have seemingly ignored and let Trump set the narrative. While the admin is doing things, it hasn‚Äôt broken through nor have any responses to his rhetoric and simplistic ideas.

Also, she didn‚Äôt address trade and Trump hammers on it. His tariffs are a bad idea but you have to explain why we still kept the Trump tariffs or what you will do to improve trade. A lot of people see it as an issue that affects their ability to get good manufacturing jobs. Not talking about it vs. Trump was a mistake.

All in all, the biggest issue I see is the campaign made it more about him and how unfit he is. While I agree, you aren‚Äôt changing minds with that sadly. People are responding to the economy and immigration; you don‚Äôt need to convince those that see democracy as the biggest concern. ‚ÄúTrump bad‚Äù is so tempting but I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs going to work.

"To those casting ""protest votes"" against Harris, you should really consider the alternative.

In regards to the conflict in Israel, Harris has been vocal about a cease fire, she's openly expressed sympathy for innocent civilians in Gaza, she even refused to show up for Netanyahu's performance in Congress recently, performance being the key word there.

Donald Trump however, has an entirely different record as president, one that we can point to, and one that illustrates his own self-serving agenda and hardline stance on the war in Gaza. 

Trump cozied up to Netanyahu, and like he has with several contentious world leaders, Trump caved in to Bibi's political pressures.

Let me preface this by saying, I'm an American Jew myself, with Ashkenazi heritage no less, but I've spent time trying to understand this conflict and its complicated history from multiple historical perspectives. 

I don't take an indiscriminate stance on this war, my views are more nuanced, so I understand that not all Palestinians, nor are all Israelis a monolith. I understand that this conflict didn't begin on October 7th. I can sympathize with Palestinians who have suffered under military occupation, from collective punishment and the dispossession of their land. I can also sympathize with the plight of Jews who suffered from violent pogroms and almost lost their ethnic and national identity as a result of the Jewish diaspora.

I also understand that the two have been engaged in a cycle of violent conflict over land since the end of WWI after the signing of the Balfour Declaration. Some historians might argue it stretches back to the late nineteenth century as ""Zionism out of despair"" became a fledgling movement. Some argue that this conflict began in the mid-20th century, but that ignores decades of history leading up to that moment in time. 

Nevertheless, I can condemn both Hamas (and adjacent terror groups) and Netanyahu as it relates to the current state of the conflict in the region. Netanyahu has made it clear that a two state solution is no solution at all, while Hamas and its allies have also been unrelenting and undeniably share the blame in perpetuating this decades-long bloody conflict. A stalemate that has cost countless lives.

That being said, Trump's record indicates that not only is he willing to take an indiscriminate stance on this war that he likely knows next to nothing about, but he's willing to do it merely because he thinks its what's best for him politically.

Believe it or not, Trump is responsible for escalating multiple conflicts in the Middle East, some of which the U.S. military was involved. 

When it comes to his staunch Pro Israel record as president, Trump acknowledged Israel's controversial annexation of Golan Heights, and in December of 2017, formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

This act alone only heightened tensions in the region and weakened the U.S.'s capacity to act as a peace negotiator between Palestinians and Israelis. Such a move was a capitulation to Israeli leaders. While Trump, or more likely his advisors, understood the move was one that would garner them more support from their Christian voters who only see Jews as a means to a biblical end, quite literally mind you.

What's more, Trump's ""Middle East peace plan"" was poorly contrived, amateurish, and a step *away* from peace in the region. In fact, as foreign policy goes, it was more of a political stunt than anything else as it also happened to coincide with his re-election campaign. This laughably insincere and ineffective plan in particular also weakened our position as peace brokers in the region.

It's also important to note, that Donald Trump, by his very nature, doesn't have any specific foreign policy or political philosophy. His only philosophy is ""what's best for me?""

So his rhetoric can change at any moment depending on what's best for his political career. It should also be noted, that his rhetoric shifted temporarily after Netanyahu acknowledged Biden's win in 2020. Trump's penchant for holding grudges and his vindictive nature can sometimes alter his public mood. He's like a temperamental child really.

And that hasn't stopped him from labeling all pro Palestinian protestors as ""radicals.""

Speaking directly to the pro Palestinian movement, Trump reportedly said,

> ‚ÄúWell, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, we‚Äôre going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,‚Äù

Trump may have offhandedly criticized Israel once or twice during this conflict, but he's quickly backpedaled with statements like, they ""have to have a victory.""

Because Trump also sees everything through a ratings lens, he's tastelessly claimed that Israel is ""absolutely losing the PR war.""

Trump hasn't laid out a plan for addressing the war in Israel if he wins a second term. But Trump's son-in-law and former nepokid, Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, recently suggested that Gaza‚Äôs current borders can be redrawn in direct contradiction with current U.S. policy.

> ‚ÄúGaza‚Äôs waterfront property could be very valuable,‚Äù Kushner said

It's likely that Trump's advisors have cautioned him against speaking out about the war, but that hasn't kept him from stigmatizing Palestinians and pro Palestinian protestors.

Also keep in mind Trump's history of bigoted remarks and actions taken against Muslims/the Arab world.

Before his presidency, Trump suggested multiple times that the U.S. has a ""Muslim problem."" He even called for the surveillance of Muslims and Muslim communities.

In 2015, he said he will ""look at"" closing mosques.

He defended warantless searches of American Muslims.

Trump once said he would ‚Äúcertainly implement‚Äù a database system to track Muslims and encouraged a Muslim registry

He called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.""

He's called Muslims ""sick people.""

Trump appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon once claimed that ‚Äúthe Judeo-Christian west‚Äù is engaged in a ‚Äúglobal war‚Äù against ‚Äújihadist Islamic fascism.‚Äù

Then there's Trump's first ""Muslim ban"", an executive order banning Syrian refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Trump issued multiple iterations of his Muslim ban after that, including one that barred foreign nationals from eight countries.

Throughout his presidency, Trump reiterated the need for a Muslim ban and extreme vetting process and claimed that crime spikes were the result of ""radical islamic terror.""

While on Twitter, Trump also retweeted posts from an anti-muslim hate group.

And to add to this, let's not forget the recent ""rally"" in MSG that included a long list of speakers spouting extreme, xenophobic rhetoric and talking points.

All that being said, what I'm getting at here is, based on both of their records, who do you think is more likely to provide Palestinians with a greater measure of support and acknowledgement as president? That's a rhetorical question by the way.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"In a few years, we‚Äôll look back on this moment and laugh at its absurdity. Voting for one genocidal party candidate over the other isn‚Äôt likely to stop the genocide. Same goes for all the other ongoing crises that our ruling class would rather we ignore.

"I‚Äôve been reading ‚ÄúWar‚Äù by Bob Woodward, the new book about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and it‚Äôs been a great and informative read but the biggest takeaway for me so far is how frankly ridiculous and removed from reality the popular narrative about Gaza has become.

If Biden pulled aid Israel would have set up a permanent military presence in the Rafah region way back in October, provoked other militants to act, and completely cut off all humanitarian aid to Gaza; the Palestinians would probably already be completely wiped out without this administration being the first in literally the entire history of Israel to threaten the status quo and leverage that aid to *stop* genocide. It is baffling how people are so quick to lay the entire blame at their feet considering that.

And I even understand and agree that it‚Äôs a little fucked to stay allies with a country who would even consider doing the things we had to stop them from doing - and have done the things they‚Äôve done - but it‚Äôs also a messy and complicated situation because basically every stable country in the Middle East wants Hamas gone making this is a surprisingly good environment for a Middle East peace process - we‚Äôve quietly been pushing other countries to push Israel toward a two state solution with normalization of relations - a historic first for many of these countries with Israel - as a reward. These countries are not interested in that deal without U.S. backing and many see Israel‚Äôs proposed solutions that the Biden administration stopped as escalations they‚Äôd have to respond to. Every indication also shows that under a new administration Israel will act differently so we‚Äôre damage controlling and biding time.

The brainwashing from social media pushed by the Russians and Israel is helping this. These are all the same people getting behind Jill Stein and some people trying to argue a few months ago that she has a chance of winning the election.

Many of the younger crowds end up more favoring 3rd party candidates as they have not really witnessed first hand that they don't actually stand a chance of ever winning.

"I wish Bernie Sanders and others would actually bother to cite what Trump and Israel planned in 2020. They had planned out annexing parts of Gaza in 2020 under the guise of Trumps ""Trump Peace Plan""  but it was allowing Israel to take more of Gaza and was approved by the Trump administration to do so. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_peace_plan there are many news articles about this with maps of before/after

>The plan was authored by a team led by Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner.[2] Both the West Bank settlers' Yesha Council[3] and the Palestinian leadership rejected the plan, the former because it envisaged a Palestinian state,[3] and the latter arguing that it was too biased in favor of Israel

Then covid hit at the same time and Israel shelved the plan, not sure if it all went through, I know some parts of it did

What's worse is that the media did have some attention earlier this year on person named Mariam Adelson. (The one that Trump gave an award too, while bashing our Troops). She is a big Trump donor who wants full annexation of Gaza in return for her support in 2024. This should have had a lot more focus from the democrats to highlight that Trump is not going to protect Gaza at all and will probably open up a blank check to Israel versus the support they were getting from the Biden administration.

"Sorry, but Israel can‚Äôt be wiped out. Many of the original settlers of Israel have been long gone or are very old, so this generation of Israelis (barring any recent migrants) is not the same as the ones from 1948, as in, they are native citizens. I‚Äôm sure they would rather be dead than to be forced to give up their national sovereignty. In order to remove Israel off the face of the earth, you would have to force the Israeli people into permanent exile and to dissolve the Israeli government. I don‚Äôt mind the government being done away with if it means that Netanyahu is arrested and barred from politics for the rest of his life, but the people will resist being forced out of the country that they lived for most of their lives. This would undoubtedly lead to conflict, countless deaths, and would be a straight up humanitarian crisis (the Middle East can‚Äôt catch a break, can it?) on par with the Gaza conflict.

And even if we assume that Israel was dissolved (which won‚Äôt be the case), the US doesn‚Äôt speak out against this (which they definitely will), and that there were few casualties (read: many casualties), where would the Israeli people go? Would the people and government of whatever country they end up accept them or would this just result in waves of xenophobic violence and antisemitism? What would replace Israel? I assume that it would be Palestine, but then what would its government be? Would it be Fatah? Would it be Hamas? Would it be PLO? Either way, this new Palestinian government would ensure to get rid of any and all Israelis that are still there. Also, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bhutan, the Vatican, and debatably North Korea are also theocratic ethnostates. So why are you not calling for *their* dissolution, as well?",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"how do you propose israel be done away with? and what should replace it? seeing as israelis would not abandon their national project themselves, the destruction of israel would be massively violent and claim heavy casualties. could also just result in a palestinian theocratic ethnostate as well, which wouldn‚Äôt be an improvement.

also israel by definition isn‚Äôt a theocracy. it has a secular government with democratically elected heads of state and government. there is a religious authority with legal jurisdiction, but it operates separate from the government and only has authority over jews (and not christian, muslim, or druze citizens etc.) compare israel to a country like the uk, who also has an official state religion and who‚Äôs head of state (the reigning monarch) is head of the anglican church, and israel is literally less ‚Äútheocratic‚Äù than the uk. total separation of church and state is something we take for granted in america, and while it‚Äôs a value i believe in it‚Äôs not something you can expect from all countries in the world (and simply not having that separation isn‚Äôt what determines a theocracy, you can‚Äôt stretch the definition like that!)

as for ethnostate, it‚Äôs really not. the main political organization for groups of people these days are nation-states, where a state coincides with a national identity. at the end of the day a nation is whatever it seems itself to be, and can range from stateless groups (eg catalonia) to justifiably the jewish people. about 73% of israel‚Äôs citizens are jewish, and 20% of israeli citizens are Arabs. compare that to japan (97% japanese), denmark (85% danish), china (92% chinese) and israel is not an outlier here either. i‚Äôm not saying that there isn‚Äôt apartheid in israel through the occupied territories, and israeli politics definitely have a major problem in terms of its hyper nationalist right wing, but at the same time i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an ethnostate or that being an ethnostate is inherent in its current model. the israeli apartheid is something that should end, and will hopefully come sooner rather than later with enough international pressure and better leadership.

The reason those kids are dead is Hamas started a war it had no business fighting and is continuing to fight past the point where surrender is necessary to preserve civilian life.

The answer? A fuckton of people. A fuckton of SUPER PASSIONATE people. Trump was the new hot thing. The guy to vote for if you wanted to ""stick it to the man"". Then, one of the first things he did in office was ban flights from foreign, primarily Muslim countries.

Trump has openly endorsed Netanyahu in his genocidal crusade. Don't fool yourself - things will be worse for Gaza if he's elected. Harris, meanwhile, has expressed desire to reach a ceasefire in Gaza. This is tougher than it seams, and a lot of people assume a button labeled ""stop funding Israel"" sits on the desk in the oval office never getting pushed. The truth is, Israel is our ally on paper, and that has so many more implications than just saying ""eh, they got attacked, we'll help them out."" Being an ally on paper means you don't get to pick and choose - it's a for better or for worse agreement. If we're going to move the needle in Gaza AT ALL, Harris is our best shot - and Palestinians have agreed with us on that front.

If they really cared about making Israel do the right thing they would have done something BEFORE Oct 7th, when the Biden administration literally thought that Israel was Annexing the West Bank due to the insane increase of settlement expansion and settler violence in the region in the first 6 months of 2023. But nope, not a single peep, not even news coverage of the state sanctioned Israeli terrorism. So much was not said that people thought October 7th came unprovoked. This admin doesn‚Äôt give two shits about Palestinians other than saving face during their ethnic cleansing, and having to try and cover for Israel killing them too quickly. We‚Äôre helping Israel slow-walk their genocide because they know that it would be a world war if they let the IDF off their leash.

‚ÄúOn April 23, 2019, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he will bring a resolution for government approval to name a new community in the Golan Heights after Trump.[49] On June 16, 2019, Israel announced the establishment of Trump Heights, a planned settlement in the Golan Heights.[50]


In June 2021, Biden administration in the US affirmed that it would continue to maintain the previous administration‚Äôs policy of recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.[51] However, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has ‚Äúsignalled openness to an eventual policy review‚Äù.‚Äù

"The Democrats and Republicans alike regularly accept donations from far right Jewish nationalists. The trade off is that as long as American politicians unequivocally support Israel, they get a ton of money to spend on achieving any other political goals. Most Americans don‚Äôt care enough about Israel (or any other foreign country) to notice so it‚Äôs been an easy tradeoff for decades.

The problem is that Israel has elected an ultra far right religious extremist government. They‚Äôre committing genocide and trying to drag the U.S. into a war with Iran. Their goal is to ethnically cleanse and annex Gaza, the West Bank, and parts of Lebanon to form ‚ÄúGreater Israel.‚Äù They have cover to do this because Biden, Harris, and Trump all support Netanyahu‚Äôs actions.

Now that the Cold War is over, there‚Äôs no strategic reason for the U.S. to ally with Israel. Most American voters, especially Democrats, strongly oppose Israel‚Äôs genocidal actions. American taxpayers are also sick of paying for an ultra-expensive military that is most often used to protect Israel from consequences. 

Similarly, there‚Äôs no longer a reason for the U.S. to fight with Iran. The UK colonized Iran and propped up the Shah (king) in order to extract oil via the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, now called BP. When the people of Iran replaced the monarch with a democracy so they could get the benefits of their own oil and other natural resources instead of Britain, Britain launched a coup to overthrow the democratic government and reinstall the monarch. The U.S. didn‚Äôt care for old school British colonialism, but they didn‚Äôt want Iran to sell oil to the USSR. So the U.S. helped Britain overthrow Iran‚Äôs democracy in favor of the puppet Shah in 1953. It was the CIA‚Äôs first coup.

The people of Iran were still furious 25 years later. A bunch of idealistic left wing students and a bunch of far right religious fundamentalists united to overthrow the Shah and expel the U.S. Then the religious fundamentalists took over entirely. Now the people of Iran are mostly atheists/non-religious and are likely going to get rid of their Islamic fundamentalist government once the current Ayatollah (only their second leader since the revolution) dies.

There‚Äôs no reason for the US to fight Iran anymore. Everyone in the U.S. and U.K. alive today is now ashamed that their ancestors were involved in colonialism (including theft, rape, slavery, and genocide.) Obviously the U.S. overthrowing a democratic government for a monarchy is hypocritical and wrong. Maybe it made sense to stop the threat of communism, but the USSR is long gone. And maybe it made sense for the US to oppose Islamic fundamentalism, but Iran‚Äôs population is mostly atheist/non-religious now. And it‚Äôs hypocritical that the US still props up Islamic fundamentalist monarchies like Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Ultimately, global politics have changed but the US has not adapted. Democratic politicians still think it‚Äôs ok to throw Americans under the bus to support Israel‚Äôs aggression. Refusing to vote for Harris changes this calculation. Democratic politicians should support members of Israel‚Äôs left wing coalition government, but not their genocidal far right religious extremist politicians.

Similarly, Israel has been able to get away with abhorrent behavior because they know they‚Äôve successfully bribed/lobbied/controlled both parties. If the Democrats stop unequivocally supporting Israel, even when they commit genocide, it forces them to be more measured in their actions. Elections become coin flips about whether they get support to commit genocide instead of a 100% guarantee. That greatly changes the incentives away from committing genocide and provoking war in favor of peace.

Trump almost certainly would be worse than Harris in the short term. But the effect of a Harris loss would change the Democratic Party in the long term. Democrats would no longer be willing/able to accept far right Jewish nationalist donations without immediate backlash. If that happens, they‚Äôll follow the will of American voters and not special interests. The U.S. would no longer be a guaranteed ally of Israel, which would make peace much more likely in the long term. 

Keep in mind that a massive chunk of Israel‚Äôs politicians and population is furious with their genocidal far right government too. Biden and Harris‚Äôs willingness to accept far right Jewish nationalist donations has propped up Netanyahu and greatly harmed all the center-right to far-left political parties in Israel. 

Ultimately, has to change. Refusing to vote for Harris, despite the loss of life associated with a Trump win, is the clearest signal that Americans aren‚Äôt willing to prop up genocidal regimes anymore.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"Not to be insulting, but I feel like you‚Äôve been misinformed on the topic of primaries. If you want to understand why, I‚Äôd suggest learning about the modern American primary system. In most of the rest of the world, the selectorate (which is distinctly different from an electorate) is extremely small, usually party insiders and dues paying members. The American primary system, which is extremely recent, was merely an attempt to better select candidates capable of winning elections. It is neither democratic nor anti-democratic.

This podcast series is entertaining and a great exploration of the topic - https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-primaries-project/

I do understand where you‚Äôre coming from, it is a unique problem given the current one party situation, but suggesting primaries should be anything more than selection isn‚Äôt a fix. It‚Äôs just not what they are, they‚Äôre not meant to be anything else.

The fix is a conservative renaissance. If Trump loses, I think there‚Äôs at least a chance that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll see. They need to take back their party, show people they can still be sane partners in governance.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Yes I believe I responded to exactly this sentiment lol. This sub is left leaning terminally online folks who are all extremely anxious about a Trump Presidency, so no one wants to be overtly critical of her until she wins. That doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt disagree with her on certain issues. 

What I am curious about is if this pattern continues if/when she is elected - I imagine once she is actually President people will revert to openly disagreeing with her on issues on this sub.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Aggression? There‚Äôs no aggression. I‚Äôm merely offering my perspective.

"Not here. I mean in broader political discourse where the norm is always ""lesser of two evils"" and ""a giant douche vs a turd sandwich.""",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Yes, she does. Follow the law as they are legally required, as the will of the people through their elected officials formally demand of them, and stop shipment of weapons to Israel when those weapons are used in criminal actions. ¬†Stop putting political pressure on the state department to do bullshit hand waving investigations and investigate accusations of illegal activity **as is their legal obligation.** ¬†¬† ¬†

There are many very specific asks that are not politically objectionable in any way, that are literally the law of the United States, except that Joe Biden and the AIPAC lobbyists in his administration desire to limit the public‚Äôs awareness of the true extent of Israeli atrocities and America‚Äôs complicity in them.¬†¬† ¬†

And no, that second part actually doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the content of the conversation and is more directly to the point. ¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say anything critical about the president, it might make us lose!‚Äù ¬†is the actual argument. ¬†Notice how I never advocated for not voting? Notice how I literally never even mentioned Harris? And you‚Äôre all just assuming I‚Äôm a partisan simply for speaking my opinion? One ¬†literally somebody assumed I was Palestinian and threatened me with accommodating the genocide. ¬†Fuck straight off, the truth is more important.

Very well said!,2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Not a Palestinian just so you know. ¬†Maybe not the most perceptive intuition you got there. ¬†¬†

¬†Netanyahu is an incompetent, corrupt, genocidal avatar of pure evil, and Biden supports him unconditionally exactly as Trump would. ¬†What specific policy of Bidens are you referring to with the implicit assertion Biden would be better? What has he accomplished?¬†",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"clearly, thanks for contributing to the conversation. ¬†‚ÄúNuh uh,‚Äù the defense rests your honor

"None of these single issue voters understand the issues they care so much about.

2A? Trump will take your guns without due process.

Abortion? Fetuses barely have brains before the third trimester, and any abortions after that are for medical emergencies. 

Gaza? Trump wants Israel to ‚Äúfinish the job.‚Äù",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Yes, I‚Äôm familiar with hypothetical. It‚Äôs used to illustrate the absurdity of a ‚Äúfalse choice.‚Äù Typically, people don‚Äôt actually defend pulling the lever because it‚Äôs considered immoral. The irony of you doing so in this situation is quite funny.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
">  This thing about Gaza was a need for them..not a nice to have.

I fully understand, this is why we needed to part ways. These people overplayed their hand and found themselves without a tent. The Republicans certaintly won't take them in and Jill Stein's tent is full of holes. I hope they enjoy the rain.

This isn't condescension. It's reality. Instead of choosing to stay in the tent and push the party in the direction they wanted it to go, they chose to leave the tent for a party that has no power to grant any of their wants or needs. I hope it was worth it. When Harris wins without these people all the bridges they burned will seem folly. I think they will find themselves in a far worse position than they could have been in and will live to regret their mistakes.

And 99% of the college kids protesting have never met a person from Gaza in actual danger. What friends and family do you imagine they are protecting?",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"If you think the US can end the war at anytime, then you are extremely naive. Not to mention this idea that they support it with ""utter glee"" is an extremely incredible mischaracterization of what has happened in reality,

Let's not forget that trump is literally on record giving Israel the go ahead to do whatever they want if he becomes president again. You are not a serious person.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"You're confused. I never once said that not voting for Harris would stop the mass murder in Gaza.

I, personally, am horrified by what Harris and her supporters have condoned and I will not be voting for her. There is nothing more evil than genocide. There is nothing more evil than dropping bombs on defenseless starving children in tents. 

If you don't have a red line for the democrats you can just say that. But I do. I'm sorry that upsets you so much.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Lmao, are you an Israeli bot/burner account? There's so many of you these days.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"I‚Äôm not dodging anything, I‚Äôve already responded to dozens of comments like yours. If you‚Äôre genuinely concerned about Trump winning, you should tell Harris to denounce Netanyahu‚Äôs genocide. Because her unequivocal support for it is the most likely reason she and other Democratic candidates may lose their elections.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"I think we're on the same page? It's concerning if there's only one viable non fascist political party, because then all that's left is the selection process. The process with the US primaries is more democratic than elsewhere (e.g. in Australia where I live it's called a ""preselection"" done by a small number of paid up party members at best), but IIRC the DNC successfully argued in court that the process didn't have to be fair and there's ways which it isn't. The way all the establishment candidates dropped out and threw their support behind Biden in 2020 but Elizabeth Warren (the main competition for Bernie) stayed in is a pretty typical thing in preselections, but it's different to see on a massive scale with so many people voting.

I'm not sure how the Republican party comes back from this while Trump is still alive and has enough of a base to influence the Republican primaries. But in my post I outlined the pathway (in theory) for 3rd parties to get on the board. I strongly support the Green Party in Australia but I can see Jill Stein for the intentional spoiler candidate she is. I find it galling whenever an Australian Green expresses support for a candidate who loves spouting Russian talking points and doesn't know the first thing about movement building.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
This sub is not left leaning.,2024_11_05,05_45_33
Yeah that can be true among moderates or centrists for sure. I just wanna bring back being able to talk about politics more civilly without potentially losing friends or getting verbally attacked.,2024_11_05,05_45_33
"You realize that foreign aid is controlled by congress and that Biden doesn't unilaterally just send Israel money because he personally feels like it, right?

That means bipartisan agreement in the house/senate before it reaches Biden's desk.

Criticism of Israel right now is toxic to campaign success. If pro-palestine rhetoric were the winning formula, you can bet your butter sticks Kamala would be running on it, but she isn't because it's not. She's carefully straddling the line. It's tactical.

Harris winning this election is of *utmost* importance to the people of Gaza, and if you care at all about the people in Gaza, you'd be helping her win too. Not voting for her or voting third party just makes you a self-righteous twat who's happy to see America (and Gaza) burn so you can make yourself feel better...about yourself. Such a thing is truly something worth not being paid attention to in political courtship.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

I've never met a Holocaust survivor, so why should I care? The mass slaughter of the Aztecs? That was five hundred years ago, who knows if they were even human. The slaves that built the pyramids? I don't even know any of their names, how am I supposed to feel for their plight without knowing their names?

"I'm mostly referring to the Arab American voters around Michigan. Yes, if you're talking about college kids who have never met a person from Gaza then it's a different personal calculation. It's the former who I have respect for. They won't regret not voting for Harris, even if trump gets in. They simply cannot vote for a person who supported Biden's failure to restrain Israel. If the student activists chose not to vote for harris over Gaza, they may well live to regret it. I agree. 

But the students might be lucky, Harris might win anyway. Or they might be lucky, trump takes a term and hands over power at the end with the USA mostly intact for them to raise a family in. In those cases they won't regret it either.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"""Stop your genocide or we destroy you."" The US could do it. It's a superpower with the most advanced and powerful military in human history. They certainly do it to other countries and they've even done it before to the Israelis. It's not like the US doesn't have a history going around the world preventing egregious atrocities. This is specifically a Biden and Harris issue. They absolutely have the means to stop it but it's not that they don't even try, it's that they're happy with the current campaign. Biden is on record repeating Israeli propaganda and talking about how much he supports Israel. He's also vetoed the UN security council's resolutions on the matter. 

And this is supposed to be the more moderate American stance?? Then the only way for Palestine to truly survive is for America to stop supporting Israel one way or another and seemingly the only way to do that is to vote for the guy that will destroy America's standing on the world stage and who will introduce such dysfunction to the point that they might not be in a position to continue to support the genocide. It's a small hope, Trump could just glass the place for sure but either option is death, Trump just presents a miniscule chance of survival.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

So you know better than the Palestinian Americans who are urging you to vote for Harris. And you admit that you'll accomplish nothing that will help them. Can you also admit the cost in lives that would come from a second Trump Presidency?,2024_11_05,05_45_33
You've lost this argument.,2024_11_05,05_45_33
"That‚Äôs the thing though, you can‚Äôt just transition the ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù part to the selection process. That‚Äôs not a fix. It just was never meant to function that way.

The US system isn‚Äôt more or less democratic, because it isn‚Äôt the democratic part to start. If the parties are not representative, they should be replaced. It has happened before, even in the US. Talking about the selection process with terms such as ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù is just ignorant.

A resounding defeat for Trump in 2020 would likely have ended him. It was unfortunate it was close enough (a few thousand votes in a handful of states) for what followed instead. I personally think thar the Republicans will move away from MAGA if they lose again, though the more decisively the better. At that point it will have been thoroughly proven that they need to moderate to win elections. Don‚Äôt forget, they control their selection process as well, they‚Äôve not been exercising that control due to believing that letting MAGA take the wheel is a path to power.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"I have a suspicion that the Arab Americans in MI know that Bibi would rather deal with Trump than Harris and they won't give him what he wants. I suspect the ability to protest vote and risk someone who would like to literally ban Muslims and finish the job in Gaza comes from a place of extreme privilege that these Arab Americans have never known. I think that in the end they come through for Harris. That's my election day prediction. Of all the swing states, Harris carries MI easiest and we see no notable change in the Arab vote.

"By Martha McHardy - US News Reporter: 

In the final stretch of the election, analysis by Newsweek indicates a significant gender divide, with women voters showing a strong preference for Kamala Harris over Donald Trump, while men show a strong preference for Trump.

Newsweek looked at the national polls since October 28 that provide a breakdown of voting intention based on gender and found that on average, women break for Harris by 8 points, while men break for Trump by 10 points. That amounts to an average gender gap of 9 points.

"Calling it now, the polling is going to be way off. Massaging the data is standard practice in polling, and they're fishing for the results they want. The response rates are just so low, they're weighting things based on 2020 and 2016, to the point they're dismissing things that don't line up as outliers and tossing it out. They're fitting the data to the conclusion they want, aka a close race. Nevermind the ones that are just making shit up.

Most polls have similar data on the Senate but not similar data on Presidents. Across swing state map, Senators have a decent 5-8 point lead while, somehow, Presidential is deadlocked.

So either A) people are ticket splitting at an historic rate or B) the president polls are inaccurate and there is a chance for a major blowout in favor of Harris (this is because most people vote down ballot.)

"Pollsters, even the very credible ones, don't account for turnout among different demographics. They weight the different demographics (age, gender, race, education, etc.) based on their real proportion in the whole population, but they don't make any predictions on the different groups' enthusiasm.

They also don't tend to account for first-time voters. In 2016, they underestimated Trump's support in Swing states because a lot of usually apolitical blue-collar workers went to vote for Trump despite having never voted in their entire lives, sometimes while being well past 30 y/o.

I don't think that this level of enthusiasm exists for Tump in 2024. ""Shy Trump voters"" don't exist anymore. They're not hiding anymore. They're assertive. There's no hidden demographic to come save Trump this time.

She's also a liar.

Here is the truth and I base this on my observations, including spending a lot of time at church and around christians: American christians, by and large, do not care about the bible, or about Jesus. For them it's purely ritual. It does not guide them. They pick and choose the parts they like. There is no other conclusion i can come to. I used to be part of a church group of young couples. The number of them who cheated on their spouses was actually shocking. One couple in particular--truly the most pious among this group of 10-15 couples--also did it. These people just talk shit as something to do and a way to belong, but few really care what Jesus says.

Indeed.

In such a view, where the benefits of egalitarianism and social progress do not exist, society is a zero sum game where other people moving towards equality means that ""we"" lose out.

The question is how to approach this, as it is not a rational issue but an emotional one. It has to do with perceived social status and self worth as much as anything else.

This isn't me saying 'both sides are the same'. They're not. But I think Americans have become lazy in how they digest news as a whole.

But this article provides a really good argument I think people should hear. It discusses the political realities Harris faces, that Donald Trump doesn't. She supports a ceasefire. No, she won't implement a weapons embargo. Because she has to consider every community she will represent. It's easy for Jill Stein to stand against Israel. She will never be held accountable for her actions, and she's not in any position to win where if it costs her votes it doesn't really matter because her goal isn't to win it's to play spoiler. For Donald Trump, it's easy for him to support Israel blindly. But for Kamala Harris, supporting a Ceasefire comes with real political risk. And doing so has had her attacked on all sides. From the right who think she's too harsh on Israel, from the Left who thinks she's not doing enough. Agreeing to stop sending weapons to Israel is not an immediate victory for Harris. She has to carefully consider all sides, and in doing so despite coming to the conclusion that we need a ceasefire (which is the correct conclusion) she gets punished for it for not agreeing with the method by which to reach said ceasefire (and as the author of the piece said, one that does NOT guarantee a ceasefire, and one that her opponent will never support anyway and her opponent doesn't see Palestinians as people)",2024_11_05,05_45_33

Israel is a sovereign nation despite what some edgesters might dramatically claim about it being an American military base. Kamala isn't able to unilaterally stop them from killing terrorists, even if said terrorists use babies as shields.

I've heard people say they want her to stop supporting Israel financially and militarily because they don't want to feel responsible and want a clear conscience; sure, from an entirely self-serving perspective I could see that but it won't help the Arabs when they break ceasefires like on 10/7.

"Thanks for posting op. I also voted for Harris, but I still feel pretty sad about it tbh. 

For all the people who can't believe why we wouldn't vote for Harris...

According to latest polls: Only 10% of Arab Americans are voting for Trump. Stein 42% and 40%Harris 8% not voting/undecided. Arab americans voting for Trump are primarily republican, and would vote for Trump regardless. Stein voters are mostly democrat, and can't bring themselves to vote for Harris. The Harris campaign really dropped the ball with the Arab Americans. 

For the record, the muslim ban is preferable to genocide ALWAYS. It's an ignorant argument, and we're tired of having to explain why. But I'll keep doing it.

 To put things in perspective... We've had 15 wars between Palestine and Israel since the 1940's. This war alone:

1.9 million displaced
43k dead
20k missing
101k injured
392k facing catastophic food insecurity
70% of livestock destroyed
68% crops destroyed
52% agricultural wells damaged
Risk of disease due to waste and sanitation interruptions 
17k children unaccompanied by an adult or family member (Likely  orphans)
Long term mental health impacts on young children (they blame themselves and its fucking horrible to think about)

I could keep going...

 My point is, any Arab american not voting for Harris has every right not to. If you want to complain, complain to Harris. Her campaign has blatantly ignored Arab americans, kicked us out of rallies unprovoked, declined invitations to speak with us, evades all questions about the war, brings Fucking Liz Cheney to Michigan, and Harris repeatedly saying, ""Israel has a right to defend itself"" when she knows damn well that's not what Israel is doing.

"> If we were living in a European style parliamentary system here in the US, I'd be voting for the green party all the way because I would expect that the Democrats would need to partner with the green party to form a majority coalition in order to form a ruling government.

I have been thinking about this a lot recently. As much as the two party system sucks, I think this might be one of the few times where it works to our advantage.

If we were to split into multiple parties, I think Donald Trump would probably be prime minister until he dies. The Democrats would probably splinter into 3-5 different groups. The Republicans might do the same, but I have to imagine the lion's share would stay with Trump and he would have the largest party.

It seems to me that the multi party system works best when you have a culture where the parties are expected to work together. Everyone understands it is unlikely they will get a majority, so they have to figure out how to build a coalition and compromise.

We don't have that. If we were to split, I think the two likely scenarios are we end up like Israel, where Netanyahu has been PM for 17 years despite never even getting 30% of the vote, or we end up like Bulgaria where there is a real possibility they're about to have their eighth election in four years because no one wins a majority and no one can manage to form a coalition.

I would think Trump would get 30-35%. He may never get 50% but what he has is very, very solid.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"> People can also not vote for Dems out of protest to push them to change policies in future elections 
   

People think ""punishing"" the party works, but it's an absolutely stupid approach in a 2 party system. Politicians will go where there are reliable votes to be had. If the left witholds its votes the Overton window can only shift to the right. The GOP will win more positions and get empowered to entrench conservative laws, court appointments, gerrymandering, etc. The lesson for the Dems then ends up being that they need to cater to the right if they want to win.
   

The way to push the country left is for the left to be a bigger, more consistent voting bloc. Hammer the GOP with loss after loss and eventually even they'll have to chase where the votes are. The Dems won't go further to the left unless the voter base becomes more liberal on average.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

My boy, in all the history of the Palestine-Israel conflict since the 40s, at most 180k Palestinians have been killed. That's 80+ years of fighting. Meanwhile their numbers have skyrocketed. 

Meanwhile in seven years of Yemeni civil war, up to 350,000+ people have been killed. In Sudan, where civil war has been ongoing for a year, up to 150,000 people have died. At the height of the Holocaust up to 14,000 Jews were killed per day, with a final death count of 6,000,000.

I understand that many on the pro-Hamasnik side are living in a post-information state where anything can be characterized by however your agenda demands, which in this case is demonization of Jews and cheapening of *actual* genocides (for example, the Holocaust, where six million of Europe's Jews were killed). But the Israeli conflict with Hamas, who (and I'm just shocked that this somehow just bypasses your attention over and over) uses their children as shields, is not a genocide. The Arabs of the Levant still speak Arabic and eat whatever Arab food Hamas releases to them, they still practice Islam and hate Jews - they're not being culturally exterminated, they're not being put in camps, they're not being firebombed. They are being subjected to the horrors of refusing to end warfare with their neighbor and electing a government of islamist extremists who attacked Israel during a ceasefire.

Words don't just mean whatever you want them to mean, even if it cynically demonizes the side you don't like (you know, the ones whose country was formed as a result of *actual* genocide, about half of whom are descended from the 800k+ Jews thrown out of their homes in Arab countries).",2024_11_05,05_45_33

Maybe people are starting to see Trump will assign random idiots like RFK Jr and Herschel Walker to head important government agencies and maybe he isn‚Äôt so good at running the country.,2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Aways practice proper poll skepticism. 

That being said, if this poll is accurate and we see mass turnout tomorrow (please vote, sorry after tomorrow you won‚Äôt have to see that phrase for a long time)‚Ä¶

"I can‚Äôt remember who said this but I saw a post on Bluesky that said something like:

‚ÄúIf you want proof that this election is being covered from the male perspective look no further than how the media is covering Women‚Äôs reaction to Dobbs. If the election were following Democrats upending the 2nd amendment every single news story would cover how men are responding to the decision by voting‚Äù

As a man, this really resonated with me. Dobbs impacts half the population directly, but we‚Äôve seen very little coverage of how women are responding.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"I'm cautiously optimistic we'll flip Iowa Blue this cycle. 
There is a lot of positive energy for Harris and I've seen FAR fewer Trump signs in Des Moines and in the country compared to last cycle.

I think some right-wingers here will say they are voting Trump but might likely stay home tomorrow.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"Even if the poll is overstating it and Trump wins Iowa by 1-2%, thats still a massive shift for democrats that would likely mean most swing states being blue. Trump was +8 in 2020 and +9.5 in 2016.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"She said that Trump was at +18 when Biden was still in the race, and now it favors Harris. That‚Äôs a crazy swing.¬†",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"YouGov (who is also doing a lot of credible polling for the election) collects data on different age group's ratio of positive opinions on politicians. It's easily searchable data, actually. Most popular politician stats.

Usual people are up top in all age groups (in order): Carter 61%, Schwarzenegger 59%, Obama 59%, Harris 54%, Sanders 49%. Trump is at 42%.

Men: Harris 55%, Trump 45%

Women: Harris 53%, Trump 39%

Millennials: Harris 56%, Trump 47%

Gen X: Harris 50%, Trump 45%

Boomers: Harris 46%, Trump 38%

Now, honestly, Trump by all accounts can and may still win. But if there's a conversation about what the polls didn't see or why things are breaking in one way or another late. The data above might come back as a central part of that conversation. Harris is seen more positively than people are realizing and Trump is under water there with every single age and gender demographic. 

The Selzer Iowa poll suggests a very, very similar skew on the 65+ voter. That Trump's support among that age group has seriously eroded. And even when you split Boomers by gender, Harris has a +10% advantage among men. and a +14% among women.

As crazy as the polls have been, there are some signs that line up with the Selzer Iowa poll that Trump is just historically unpopular and especially so with the most reliable voters. There's at least some evidence that she's seeing something real there.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"I don't think anyone can expect that Harris actually wins Iowa, even this pollster seems dubious that Harris would win Iowa. However in a atmosphere that's is mostly ""Vibes"" and no real actual evidence of how this election is going to go, this poll is probably the first real warning shot that Trump might be in trouble. Nate Cohn made the point that both in Iowa and NE 1 they've seen a big shift towards Kamala, even if she still is likely to lose both, but if those are showing that shift, those very red places, then it's a real real bad sign for elsewhere for Trump.¬†",2024_11_05,05_45_33

She cites women 65 and older being the main difference. That is not surprising to me for one reason.

It allows the behavior to follow in other countries. The radicals, the extremists in other countries come out from the cracks and try to follow what America has done. Donald Trump will support worst of the worst people and dictators, supplying them with fund, military grade weapons to cause chaos. Trump will use the chaos as the ladder to rise and get richer. He will cause the whole world to go into throws of chaos. Pleaseeee make Kamala win. Please, not just for your sake but for the rest of the world‚Äôs as well. No one wants a 3rd world war.

"I treat all polling, regardless of whether or not I like their analysis, the same way one should treat palm readers and psychics. 2016 proved that pollsters have absolutely zero idea what is happening in the electorate and the herding being done now to course correct for their failure in 2016 is evidence that you genuinely cannot trust anything being said right now. 

I‚Äôm pretending that everything I‚Äôm hearing- even from Selzer- is being shouted at me in the subway by a homeless person, and I give it the same consideration. Nothing more than that. I marked my ballot straight Dem a few days ago and I‚Äôm waiting to see what happens tomorrow.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"This poll is the gold standard in Iowa from an independent pollster known for just sticking to the data and not weighting the data to stick towards conventional wisdom or what happened in previous years. Her showing Trump up by four points back in September was considered a really bad sign because Iowa is one of the most conservative states in the Midwest and Trump needed to be at least 8 points ahead to feel comfortable in Wisconsin and Michigan. Trump down by 3 is a shockwave that signals an election that won‚Äôt be close and hints that pollsters have been doing a lot of herding that has masked some major voter shifts. 

She has only missed presidential elections and primaries by 1-2 points a handful of times, often getting it dead on. Her worst performance was the 2018 Iowa Governor race where she was off by about 4 points but was still within her margin of error.

if anyone is unfamiliar she is often cited as the best pollster in the country.  She only does Iowa and her biggest miss since 04 was still in the margin of error.  Her 04 miss even has a good explanation (needle moving GW rally after her poll collected data) 

Harris being within single digits would have been encouraging.  +3 is jaw dropping.... 2:1 among senior women is jaw dropping. +2 among senior men also jaw dropping (and Iowa is very white if anyone was unclear)

My only reservation is Iowa is in the 'worst' category for trump abortion bans, so its possible this doesn't generalize to states with less restrictive bans yet similar demographics (so Wisc/Mich basically)

It shouldn't be just these articles, IMO.  Every visible aspect of the fundamentals of the Harris and Trump campaigns paint a very clear picture of who has the momentum and who has had the momentum since the day Biden stepped down.

This poll confirms to me that this election is not going to be close.  Much of the other polling has only created that false narrative.  Just as that other polling showed a massive Biden win and an easy HRC win.

Even if they do win, this is a presidential, if this is even close and it is genuinely on the back of those voters, the GOP will hobble itself every four years when they struggle to turn them out at midterms. It will be the same problem the Dems have had in off years for decades. 

The reality though is that I would bet on them splitting four or five ways, conservatives who realise that they need to broaden the base but didn't have the balls to say it while Trump ran the party and looked like a winner, plus MAGA who will either limp along with Donald as he declines or will be left with 3 or 4 competing ghouls. 

If they win, all bets are off but the one thing I will say is that there's not the room or energy in the party to keep it going through another loss in my opinion.

"Here's what I see happening if everyone reading this actually votes. The Iowa numbers are real and point to a trend across the nation. Harris not only wins most/ all of the swing states, but an unexpected safe red state like Texas, Florida, or Ohio flip as well. Election is largely decided tomorrow or early Wednesday. Democrats gain big in the house, but probably lose one net in the senate. 

tRump of course cries fraud. His rapid cult base gets riled up along with the true believers in the party leadership. There is a flurry of lawsuits but with such a big blowout loss it looks pathetic and doesn't go anywhere. There are a few lone wolf terrorists acts, but nothing large scale or coordinated. 

The semi smart Republicans leaders start to slowly distant themselves from trump (smart ones already saw what was coming and joined republican for Harris). At this point, it would be impossible to deny that the juice is not worth the squeeze electorally. He's been nothing but a looser in every election since 2016. So, someone like Rubio comes out and says it's time to look forward, not relitigate the last two elections. 

tRump obviously doesn't like this. So he does what he does whenever a republican steps out of line and sticks the MAGA threat machine on them. Now, there have been deep cracks in the party for a long time, as demonstrated by the speaker elections in the house. These cracks now become full breaks, and an internal civil war for control of republican party begins. 

Now the big problem for Republicans is trump and his family now controls the RNC. So trump is in control of the parties money and all the branding/intellectual property. Regaining control is undoubtedly going to take time and likely lawsuits. Things get very messy and embarrassing. Lots of finger-pointing and blame game. 

Meanwhile, Harris becomes president and continues where Biden left off. tRumps trials move forward. More and more embarrassing and disqualifying details come out. Likely some new crimes will be committed by trump. He will undoubtedly say he's running in 2028. But it also becomes near impossible to hide how far gone he is mentally

Republicans enter 2026 with a deeply divided party. There will likely be several important races where more than one person claims to be the real republican. With conservatives splitting votes between two candidates, united Democrats clean up in elections across the country. With this power, they are able to pass campaign finance reform, anti gerrymandering, and a new voting rights bill. 

So by this point, there will likely be two groups claiming to be the real conservative party. They will have lost some of their most important tools for retaining power. And there will be active litigation about the parties money and who gets the right to call themselves a capital R Republican. A brand that is now forever poisoned by trump anyways. The party slowly dies like the Whiggs,  with the majority shifting to the Democrats and a tiny hard right party forming from whatever is left of trumps cult base. The Overton window shifts left, and eventually, a progressive party splits from the Democrats  becoming the new second party in our two party system.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"The one thing that Selzer has going for her is: Methodology.

Polls aren't an easy thing, really. You just don't call some people and publish the results directly. You have to weight peoples decisions in polls very pointed. For example, by looking at election projections, one voter in rural areas does not have the same impact as one voter in a city. A black person has not the same weight as a white person. Lesser educated workers aren't as likely to vote as higher educated ones. There are dozens of variables, each of which can tilt to a certain degree. That's why there are dozens of corrections implemented in polls. The biggest problem with all polls is, objectively, that they are not openly presenting their methodology - which makes sense, because it's their business model. That results in a black box were no one but the pollster knows how they weighted whom and how the corrected for other variables. 

And this is just the methodology after you have your data. How you obtained the data is essential as well: On which day, at which time, in which region do you call people. If you'd, for example, call people at 2 pm in a rural county only, your poll could speak for that special group and that group only and would be useless for entire election prediction.

And thats why Selzer is the gold standard, because she knows Iowa. And it's exactly why she is just doing Iowa: She knows the place, she has good secondary data on how to weight her variables. She knows where to call, when to call, whom to call. Which is why im cautiously optimistic. I don't really see how Harris could have +3 from a +8 for Trump in 2020. But IF this is actually true or close enough in the ballpark of an 11% swing (even 6% would be insane) then Harris potentially wins in a landslide and i implore anyone who still hasn't voted to go out to make that a truth tomorrow.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

3. They ran on trans issues instead of the economy. To this day I still don't understand... They had a slam dunk election. 8% inflation, raising rates, high gas bills...

The last time a Republican candidate for President did anywhere close to that good in an election, it was 2004. And before that it was 1984. One was in the wake of a national tragedy and a level of national unity that seems impossible in today‚Äôs political climate and the other was because Reagan. 

Trump will max out at 47% nationally as he did the last time he ran, because he has done nothing to grow his base, has in fact alienated a small but noticeable fraction of Republican voters, and has the dumbest policies in history. Oh and also he‚Äôs a racist fascist rapist and felon. 

And 2016 was 8 years ago. Trump campaigned successfully in 2016 because he could claim outsider status and his opponent, herself an unintentional but undeniable symbol of the kind of insider politician voters clearly hated, ran the worst campaign for president I‚Äôve seen in my life until Trump‚Äôs campaign this year. 

Trump now only has grievances and outright fascism going for him. He has been directly or indirectly responsible for massive electoral losses since 2016 for the Republicans because people hate what he represents.

"People voted for him because he was given massive exposure by the media, though. When he first appeared as a candidate, he got far, far more attention than any other candidate because he was so outrageous and the media loved that for the engagement and viewers. He was great for business (and still is). If they had basically ignored him, he never would have even been the nominee, let alone elected. 

My issue isn't that any of this is affecting polls or anything. My point is just that we don't need to hear every single day about what the latest polls are saying. It doesn't matter unless you're in charge of campaign strategy and use that information to adjust what your candidate does. It makes absolutely no difference at all to the public to know that ""today, slightly more people favor Trump over Kamala"" or vice versa.

But that does not mean that men do not have a direct personal stake in the matter.  Just the same as a wife has a direct personal stake in the well-being of her husband, or that parents have a direct personal stake in the well-being of their children.

According to Donald Trump and his allies, his second term would be ""nasty,"" ""bloody,"" and filled with ""hardships"" for much of the population.

When Donald Trump uses the word ‚Äúnasty,‚Äù he tends to target those who have the audacity to criticize him or stand in his way. In 2016, for example, the Republican referred to Hillary Clinton as a ‚Äú[nasty woman](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/trump-calls-clinton-a-nasty-woman-789659203730).‚Äù Eight years later, the former president whined about Michelle Obama‚Äôs campaign appearances, complaining that the former first lady¬†[became ‚Äúnasty.‚Äù](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/trump-calls-michelle-obama-nasty-during-rally-222910533924)

Last year, during a town hall event on CNN, Trump described moderator Kaitlan Collins as a ‚Äú[nasty person](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/trump-refers-to-town-hall-moderator-as-nasty-person-173952069830).‚Äù About a year later, he accused New York Attorney General Letitia James of having¬†[a ‚Äúnasty‚Äù mouth](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112140805955525043).

"Well fortunately there won't be a second Trump term.

0 solidly blue states will flip red.

1-3 traditionally red states (IA, FL, TX) are polling in a manner that suggests at least 1 of these red states will flip blue by a small but viable enough margin to win (Florida most likely, Texas least likely).

PA will go to Harris (the energy here for her vs Trump is awe inspiring Also Biden won PA by more than double the votes Trump won it in 2016 and only once since 1992 did PA go to a Republican presidential candidate).

WI and MI will likely go to Harris by smaller margins but still blue.

There's just no real path for Trump to an electoral college win. He hasn't gained nearly enough voters to offset all those he's lost since 2016 (old age, covid, republicans for harris) and offset all those Biden had in 2020 AND Harris has gained in 2024.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

There are many great women in the Republican party for him to choose as well, but he is going to have monster returns electorally among Hispanics, African Americans, and Asian Americans.

Voters go to the polls on Tuesday to cast their ballots in this most consequential of presidential elections, and Donald Trump has given them plenty to consider over the last week.



He has had little to share about his economic vision and less still about affordable health care and housing. There has been almost nothing voters could latch on to about reproductive rights, national security, global diplomacy, education, better jobs, the climate crisis, American competitiveness or hope and opportunity.

The whole rhetoric surrounding this stuff is wrong even, often, on the left. Things aren't perfect but material conditions are actually better than they were before the pandemic - the populist attempt to say ""actually things are bad but they are bad because the populist left explanations are correct, not the populist right"" is wrong by giving credence to the populist misunderstanding of the economy in the first place.

Nice anecdote, but [according to statistics](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/groceries-are-more-affordable-now-than-in-2019-so-why-are-people-still-so-mad-about-prices-74b5a6db) groceries are more affordable now than before the pandemic

Prices have increased *but pay has increased more*. 

People are irrational and get mad at high prices, but make more money and can afford to buy more than they could before 

The actual legal definition of ""price gouging"" can be a bit vague and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally something will not be legally considered price gouging if prices go up but people are making more money and thus can afford to buy more than they could before

Then the inner barrier will be to the doors of the Capitol building.  Capitol police will hold this line, probably with non-lethal weapons.  If MAGAts cross from the outer to the inner, they'll be shot with rubber bullets and bean bag rounds.  If they are in danger of being overrun, DC police and the Guard will be brought in, both with live rounds.  If they breach the inner barrier of the Capitol building live rounds from Capitol Police will stop them.

I think if we see violence it will be in pockets around polling stations or legislatures in swing states and not a whisper of organized mobs in the capitol. The 2024 coup will most likely revolve around invalidating segregated provisional ballots and delaying/denying certification of EV totals from swing states to force the total EV count lower thus removing the 270 EV threshold to determine the winner.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Kaplan



Within the company, Kaplan advocated against restrictions on racially incendiary speech.[19] He played an important role in crafting an exception for newsworthy political discourse when deciding on whether content violated the community guidelines.[19] During the 2016 election, Kaplan advocated against closing down Facebook groups which allegedly peddled fake news.[19] Kaplan argued that getting rid of the groups would have disproportionately targeted conservatives.[19][3] During and after the 2016 US presidential election, Kaplan argued against Facebook publicly disclosing the extent of Russian influence operations on the platform.[20]

In 2017, after Facebook had implemented changes to its algorithm to expose users to more content by family and friends and less by publishers who were determined by Facebook to engage in misinformation, Kaplan questioned whether the algorithm disproportionately hurt conservative publishers and successfully advocated for Facebook to change the algorithm again.[19]

He pushed against a proposed Facebook project that was intended to make Facebook users of different political views engage with each other in less hostile ways. Kaplan argued that this feature would lead conservatives to accuse Facebook of bias.[7][5] Kaplan also reportedly advocated on behalf of Breitbart News and the Daily Caller within Facebook.[5][6] Kaplan has helped to place conservatives in key positions in the leadership of Facebook.[3]

In 2018, he advocated strongly for the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.[21] Kaplan sat behind Kavanaugh during his Senate confirmation hearings.[21]",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"I mean, is there any point in saving what the GOP is *now*?


Look, I was a GOP kid, growing up. Red family, red county, hardly knew a Democrat. But my understanding of my party was that we were the adults in the room - the ones who were practical on economics, the ones who believed strongly in hard work to advance in life, the ones who believed in loving, connected families, the ones with Christian values, and the ones who believed in personal liberty and minimal government interference in our lives.¬†


Who stands for those values now? Economists widely agree that Harris' economic plan is more sound. Democrats believe in creating an equal playing field where all people have a shot to succeed. It's Democrats who embrace gay and trans kids instead of alienating them to please their church communities, who care about kids' safety in schools, who work to protect women during the uniquely dangerous time of our lives called pregnancy so we can stay with our families and our kids for years to come. It's Democrats who embrace a Christlike mission to provide for the poor and to give hospitality to the foreigner. It's Democrats who value my liberty, staying out of discussions between me and my doctor, accepting however I want to live my life whether it's weird or mainstream or otherwise.¬†


Of course I'm a Democrat now. They're everything I, perhaps naively and wrongly as a child, believed the GOP to be. I was also a very outdoorsy kid and an outdoorsy adult, and while the environment wasn't on my radar as a kid, it sure as hell is now, and they're better on that too.¬†

When Trump losses his influence, the party just reverts back to what it once was. I don't know if he will win or lose this time around, but if he losses, he's done. He had a second chance, he's not going to be given a 3rd chance as an 82 year old.

And MAGA despises the ""old style"" republicans of semi-respectable politics, quiet dogwhistles and big business.

And with how close the races have been even with high MAGA engagement, it seems to me like Republicans can't possibly win if MAGAs lose interest in voting, unless they move to the left significantly. What a boon that would be for America, but I suspect they'll let the whole thing collapse rather than do that.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

Here are a few excerpts from this endorsement:

> We are living through the nastiest, ugliest and most divisive contest for the United States presidency ever. Yet the decision this year is quite simple, the choice quite clear.

> Donald J. Trump, a former president, has no place in American politics and certainly no place leading the United States of America as its 47th president.

> Vice President Kamala Harris is the only choice in 2024, and the Advance/SILive.com endorses her enthusiastically and without hesitation.

> It is essential to elect a candidate who we can respect, a candidate who respects the people they will lead, a candidate who respects our global allies.

> Donald Trump is none of that. He has been called ‚Äúcrude,‚Äù ‚Äúvulgar,‚Äù ‚Äúunhinged,‚Äù and ‚Äúdelusional.‚Äù

> All of which Donald Trump is.

> John F. Kennedy, when elected, told America the torch was being passed to a new generation.

> It is time to pass that torch again, keeping it from a man who peddles hatred, who threatens his fellow citizens, who disparages anyone who has the temerity to disagree with him, who is so mercurial in his thought process ‚Äì if there is a thought process ‚Äì that no one knows what he might do next.

> &quot;In this election, Kamala Harris is the only hope to save America from a continuation of the chaos we saw in Trump&#039;s first four years, and indeed, in the four years that followed as Trump continued to sow hatred and divisiveness,&quot; the editorial continued, adding, &quot;If our goal is a better, kinder America, an America where we are not afraid to be ourselves, Kamala Harris is that alternative.""

> All day, political nerds had been waiting for the results of J. Ann Selzer&#039;s famously accurate poll of Iowa.

> In 2020, her poll again showed Trump ahead by seven points, which was both close to the final tally and, in retrospect, a sign that Joe Biden&#039;s margins in neighboring states like Wisconsin would be much thinner than other polls were indicating.

> Selzer&#039;s poll shows independent women backing Harris by 28 points, and women 65 and older backing her by 2-1.

"I think its a few things. One which is probably obvious, is that a lot of men think women are just emotional, and that once they get over their emotions they'll ""be rational"" and align with the way they think. The other is that they think this doesn't actually affect a lot of women directly, especially Republican women, because most women don't get abortions and once they're past their child bearing years they wont need them. For their base, they assume that they don't WANT their daughters and grand-daughters to get abortions.

Ultimately its that they can't put themselves into women's shoes and see how much of a threat abortion bans are to them, and its even harder for them to see how women who won't need abortions can empathize with women who might. I think a lot of this boils down to a lack of empathy. They can't see how an safe and legal abortion service is this super important and relief giving safety net that yes, no one wants to have to use, but so many are thankful and feel safer when they know they can if they need to.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"It was those stupid-ass trigger laws. 

For those who are younger or just didn't know, throughout the 2010s a lot of states passed abortion restrictions under Roe with a ""trigger."" A law that as written acknowledged it was unconstitutional at the time but would immediately take effect if the courts reversed that opinion. Fundamentally this is a concept that should have never been allowed for anything, but because most people figured they wouldn't actually go as far as to tamper with Roe nationally anyone raising the alarm was written off as an annoying feminist nag. Which was really popular to do circa 2015, even if many of those folk love to call themselves leftists today.

Because these were never intended to actually take effect, always just empty virtue signalling to Evangelicals, they were often written to be crazy extreme. And Republicans cannot admit they're wrong about anything. It would have been trivial to just pass a damn national bill that set a baseline...but that can't happen when your party has had a decade of primary jockeying over who can be the ""most"" anti-abortion.

 ""Among the youngest Americans, Democrats have held an advantage in votes for House of Representatives candidates in every midterm or presidential election since the late 1990s. Yet in 2022, the 18- to 29-year-old age group (made up of Gen Z and the youngest millennials) showed an even more pronounced shift toward Democrats. It is one of the few demographic groups to show a higher D-R margin in the nationwide House vote than for the 2020 presidential election (D-R value of 28 in 2022, compared to 24 in 2020). This is amplified by the fact that this age group‚Äîas in the 2018 midterms and 2020 presidential election‚Äîregistered a rise in turnout compared to pre-2018 elections, according to a Tufts University analysis.

This is antisemitic bullshit, what the Jews have dealt with for over 2,000 years - the stigma that Jews are more loyal to Israel than their home country. But that's bigotry. Jewish Americans are *Americans.*


Democrats were the right choice for this nation before 10/7/23 and they're the right choice after it. As you may guess I'm myself Jewish (Conservative) and as far as I'm concerned there's absolutely no justifiable choice except Kamala and a blue downballot.


I'm even a Zionist. I think the Jews should be able to live in the land it's documented in countless historical records that our ancestors built the Jewish Homeland. Where there can be zero doubt about who developed the land as you can go physically touch the remains of thousands of years old Jewish historic sites.


At the same time I think modern Israel is unambiguously committing crimes against humanity and to say they ""need to stop"" is a gross understatement. Bibi needs to......... follow in the footsteps of Ghaddafi (don't ban me pls). However supporting Jews returning to the land we've prayed  multiple times daily for thousands of years to return to.... that's Zionism. It doesn't mean Israeli politics are even kinda ok, and it absolutely doesn't and NEVER HAS meant non-Jews aren't allowed or should be killed.


But calling *30* rabbis (even orthodox) supporting Harris a fucking *rebellion* is just ignorant and racist.

All it requires is a simple google search to see that you‚Äôre wrong bro.,2024_11_05,05_45_33
"This might be a case of a simple Google search not sufficing. I grew up modern Orthodox, attended modern Orthodox day school from ages 6-16, worked for several years as an adult at that same school, attended an Orthodox synagogue for many years, and live with my modern Orthodox parents in a mixed Orthodox/modern Orthodox community. I'm no longer a believer, but that doesn't mean I've forgotten my upbringing or am entirely disconnected from the community around me.

The idea that a woman can be an Orthodox rabbi is as absurd as Messianic Jews claiming to be Jewish. Just because people identify as belonging to a group, does not mean that the bigger group considers them a part. Without appealing to the No True Scotsman fallacy, there are certain fundamental tenants of Orthodox Judaism that if one does not ascribe to, one cannot reasonably claim to be Orthodox. This is one of those. Check out the [Wikipedia article on Open Orthodoxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Orthodoxy), a group which allows women to serve as rabbis and which claims to be orthodox. Under no uncertain terms is the movement considered to be Orthodox by the larger Orthodox movement.

But hey, if you still believe a simple Google search over the experiences of someone who had lived and breathed the religion and culture for nearly 20 years and over a Wikipedia article which addresses the issue, why not try asking this question in r/Judaism or r/exjew (which is mostly made up of ex-Orthodox Jews)?",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Your assumption that I‚Äôm not Jewish or that I wasn‚Äôt also raised Modern Orthodox without asking is interesting and possibly an indication you haven‚Äôt fully ditched the misogyny of your upbringing. Be more curious.

It seems you grew up in a ‚Äúmixed Orthodox / modern Orthodox community‚Äù so your experience may be different and I don‚Äôt doubt you belonged to a congregation that rejects women rabbis or likens them to Jews for Jesus (yikes!). That doesn‚Äôt make your experience true for all modern Orthodoxy. While they may not be universally accepted, I recommended a google search to see there are modern Orthodox woman rabbis in the world.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Come on, stop playing these games. I linked to a Wikipedia article that unquestionably demonstrates that the orthodox community as a whole does not recognize female rabbis. This is wholly in accordance with my claim that orthodoxy does not allow females to be ordained as rabbis. Open orthodoxy considers its practices orthodox; the larger community does not. It's really that simple. The claim that women can serve as orthodox rabbis is a fringe belief that is overwhelmingly rejected by all but a few.

It's laughable that you accuse me of misogyny. These are not my views‚Äîthey are the views of an archaic religion which doesn't belong in modern society. My ability to parrot those views is by no means an endorsement of them. I think they're reprehensible. I'm a secular humanist, and I include feminist under that label. I'm sorry that orthodox Judaism is inherently misogynistic. I'm further sorry that you've apparently identified this inherent misogyny and have found yourself part of a fringe movement geared towards fitting a square peg in a round hole in order to minimize cognitive dissonance. Practice whatever you want and call yourself what you want, but expect that others will express the more widely held view that women cannot be orthodox rabbis. It will be your choice whether or not to be offended.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Dude, once again ask a question rather than force your assumptions on others. Now you assume I‚Äôm religious and part of a ‚Äúfringe movement‚Äù as if Modern Orthodox Judaism isn‚Äôt fringe in of itself. You can still dislike Orthodox Judaism and admit women rabbis are recognized in some Modern Orthodox congregations. It doesn‚Äôt absolve orthodoxy.

Anyway, if you take a step back, the question is whether you see 33 Orthodox rabbis endorsing Harris as legitimate. You‚Äôre arguing they‚Äôre not legitimate because some of them are women. I think that‚Äôs fucked up because I see them as legitimate, and I think there‚Äôs plenty of ethical reasons any religious leader should support Harris over Trump. What‚Äôs your point - that Orthodoxy wronged you so they must be evil and therefore all support Trump? The world‚Äôs not that simple.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"No, my original point, simply stated, is that among those who signed onto this letter claiming to be orthodox Jewish rabbis, at least nine would not be considered orthodox by any mainstream orthodox community, and it is disingenuous to claim that they are when no traditionally orthodox/modern orthodox individual would consider them to be so. There are any number of comparisons that can be made here to people claiming they belong to a group whose own members, by virtue of tradition, do not consider those very people to belong to said group. The views which I have parroted are well-founded within the orthodox/modern orthodox tradition. The views which you express are not well-founded and only exist within some small, fringe movements.

I don't understand how this can be any simpler. I made a claim. You challenged that claim, not with any argument, but a simple assertion that a simple Google search would prove me wrong. I described an upbringing which provided me far more insight than the average individual would have and linked to an encyclopedia page demonstrating the veracity of my claims. You continued to deny the evidence and very illogically decided that I must currently hold misogynistic beliefs held by a religious group that I have not belonged to for over a decade. It's time to either demonstrate that orthodox Judaism, as most orthodox Jews and Jewish authorities understand it, accepts female rabbis in the orthodox tradition, or it's time to acknowledge you are wrong about this.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

> Donald Trump? He&#039;s taken a different tack, with his campaign using its last days to tell Americans the ways they&#039;d make their lives much, much worse.

> In the past week, Elon Musk-a top supporter and key adviser to the former president-has fantasized about a full-scale economic collapse, suggesting that the &quot;Temporary hardship&quot; many Americans would suffer with a Trump win would be a good thing.

> The frankness with which Trump and his allies have discussed their destructive plans could be even more damaging to his electoral prospects than all that: Even voters who aren&#039;t tuned into the implications for democracy in 2024, after all, may not like the idea of suffering economic &quot;Hardship&quot; just so Elon Musk can dismantle the administrative state, or having former NFL star Herschel Walker be in charge of missile defense because he campaigns for Trump.

Regardless, democrats are able to be shamed into doing the right thing. The GOP, haha that's a good joke. Trump wants to start setting the army on protestors.

So the choice is A. Democrats that can be pushed slowly in the right direction through protests, or 2. Trump who'll set the dogs on you for daring to protest for gazans rights; but the plight of gazans will be the least of ones worries when in jail after being pepper sprayed. (If you'd like to do a pro zionist settler protest under trump, I""m confident that will be allowed.)

I guess if one just wants performative action to feel good about oneself, it will be easier to get arrested by trump's admin and feel good about yourself than will be to protest and get arrested by harris' admin.

I'm a leftist but it pains me to see this false narrative being pushed by leftists that a vote means you give tacit approval to everything a president will ever do or has ever done. Let's not even get into what would be better or worse for Palestinians with a Harris win, but voting for her does not mean you approve her continuing to engage in a 70+ year war that literally ever administration has been a part of and will be a part of regardless of who wins tomorrow.

This false narrative also implies you can't pressure/protest presidents you vote for when they do things you don't like. Speaking of, a common complaint of leftists when explaining what they won't vote is that they think it's implied that if you vote, that's the extent of your political engagement. However, how many of these leftists are activists and how many of them are keyboard warriors? I do know plenty who fall into both categories so I at least give credit to those who are activists working in grass roots causes.

Lastly, when you vote, you need to factor in what will change and what won't. If engaging in genocide (regardless of scale of engagement) is going to occur regardless of who wins the presidency, then it ceases to become a factor when voting. 

So, miss me with that ""I won't vote for genocide"" bullshit. Also, I mean really, since statistically speaking lack of votes supports Republicans, and the current Republican promises to do worse to Palestinians, you actually *are* voting for genocide by choosing not to vote.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"Every time someone wants to start giving shit to leftists because of Gaza, I need to ask you, do you actually believe that leftists represent a significant enough voting bloc that they can somehow sway the results of an entire election because there is apparently enough leftists that are all on the boat so hard as single issue voters for Palestine that they‚Äôre withholding their votes?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, because for some reason, everyone thinks I‚Äôm a Trump voter when I point this out, I believe that every leftist *should* be voting for Kamala if only because we are locked into a no-win solution where no matter what, our only two ‚Äúchoices‚Äù are a pair of genocide merchants (one of them who also doubles as a genocidaire). Also recognize, leftists represent a variety of demographics. Personally, I know more of the queer community to lean left further than not, and considering we‚Äôre all scared of a second Trump term, we‚Äôre voting for the option that doesn‚Äôt rebrand a portion of us as pedophiles who deserve to be executed.

Now, if you think we are a significant enough number of voters that we‚Äôd throw an entire election, why aren‚Äôt you more pissed at Kamala for not throwing single issue pro-Palestine leftists a bone? All she needs to do is play lip service with leftists at the least to get a vote, so why can‚Äôt she even bother doing that if she wants to defeat Trump? It would be like if she was for keeping abortion up to the states, and every left-wing woman in the US gets outraged that she‚Äôs not doing enough to earn their vote on the one thing. People would think she‚Äôs a dumb ass for not pursuing that demographic, but then imagine you have a bunch of hardline democrats telling you ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a fucking idiot if you‚Äôre not voting for Kamala because your alternative is worse‚Äù

I think that these leftists you‚Äôre complaining about are an insignificant part of the voting population that you‚Äôve chosen to over generalize to a point where I personally start finding it borderline offensive toward the majority of us that are probably just grumbling while we vote for someone who does not represent our class interests.

And when you choose to make leftists your boogeyman for losing the election, you fall into the hands of the people in power who have money by choosing to infight with a segment of the population who has more in common ideologically than right-wingers do instead of focusing on the people in power wronging us all.

"I am an advocate for a woman's bodily rights... but to be clear, you're comparing the deaths of hundreds of women per year to the deaths of \~10,000 Palestinian women in the past year alone.

Not to mention the nearly 20,000 children.

And let's not discount the thousands of civilian men, many elderly.

Let's not forget that a city the size of Detroit and home to 3x more residents as Detroit has seen about 70%-80% of its buildings destroyed and all public infrastructure.  There are still 2.2 million people in Gaza today... should we forget that aid is currently being withheld from the area, which includes food, water, medical equipment, and fuel?  Should we forget that millions were told to shelter on the beach with no where to take a shit except for in the sand... and as the rainy season comes... what happens to that shit when the ground is covered in water.

Women's rights are important... 100% ... but an ethnic cleansing leading to potentially hundreds of thousands dead, hundreds of thousands injured, potentially a million starved, and ultimately potentially millions forced off their land...AGAIN!... is also pretty GD important.

It's funny you insist that this is a single issue...  usually the statement is ""they think it's more important than abortion rights"".   Seems to me, a lot of people voting Democrat are also single issue voters... women's reproductive rights being the issue.

What I don't understand is what you think Harris will do about it?  Roe is gone, and the Supreme Court isn't going anywhere for the next 4 years, unless one suddenly dies, which even then, won't give the liberal justices a majority.  6 justices voted down Roe.  3 voted in defense of it.  This is now a state's issue, and I can't see how Trump would codify an abortion ban at the federal level without winning the presidency and having a majority in both houses of congress.  Something most analysts don't think is coming.  So am I willing to pause on this issue and triage the ongoing atrocity occurring in Gaza?  Yes I am.

But ... have you ever considered that the Israel protest isn't just a single issue?  I don't think it's as simple as you're letting on.  If you care to read why I think that, then here you go.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1gjknnt/comment/lvg6cn5/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1gjknnt/comment/lvg6cn5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Of course, I honestly don't think you or anyone else will read it.  People don't want the facts.  They don't want to think about complex issues... they want simple and easy black and white decisions.  To me, that's the embodiment of ignorance.

Not that I want it to happen, or that I think it'll happen, but I could also tell you that strategically over the longer term, it makes more sense for Donald Trump to win this election and preside over the next 4 years as the economy weakens.  It's his last term; I very highly doubt he'll circumvent our Democracy.  Even if he were able to, the man's simply not gonna last much longer...  More likely is we have another election in 4 years... except if Trump does a horrible job as we all think he will, then it will give Democrats a real possible run at winning the presidency and both houses of congress in 2028.  Now if you want to codify abortion rights at the federal level.. then that is the only possible way to do it.

Y'all like to say things like , ""But Trump would level Gaza and be worse than Democrats"".   When people say this, I know they haven't actually been following what's been happening in Gaza or spent a moment to look at how much damage has already been done.  Gaza has already been leveled.  The US has already supplied Israel with $18 billion in weaponry this year to finish leveling it.  We've put zero conditions on our aid to them.  If they run out of weapons, we'll just do another aid package.

However, if the US allows this conflict to continue unabated... to allow Israel to continue to escalate this conflict in the middle east, then we could quickly find ourselves in a large scale war with Lebanon, Syria, and Iran simultaneously.  Another conflict that could resolve in hundreds of thousands of people killed.

""But women's reproductive rights""... am'i'right?

This is the problem with thinking so short term.  This is the issue with the real 'single issue voters'.  You never think beyond the current moment.  You never think about the entire picture.

It really does beg the question... why are Democrats not moving on this issue when it's clear that a fairly hefty chunk of typical Democratic voters are saying they won't vote for Democrats, and may never vote for them again?  That in of itself is an additional issue to consider.  What is the force acting on the Democrats to enable them to support a genocide and to enable them to stop listening to the voters?

"I mean, not saying you haven't, but if you read the article, there are almost no comments quoted from Palestinians explicitly saying Trump would be worse. 

The quote from the headline of the article ""Trump would be the worst"" is further referenced in the article, and the Palestinian quoted goes on to say: ‚ÄúBut any candidate that becomes president will not support Palestinians.‚Äù (Asmaa Nimilaat, 50). 

That's the entire extent of Trump being directly quoted by Palestinians in the whole article. I think it's also worth pointing out that this article is from July and one of the quotes in the article:

""Nabeel said Palestinians in Gaza just want the next US president to speak about ‚Äúsafety, freedom and healing‚Äù rather than Israel‚Äôs right to ‚Äúself-defence‚Äù.""

After Harris became the Democratic nominee, she has consistently brought up Israels right to self-defence since this article came out. The sad reality is most Palestinians believe what is happening is just going to continue regardless of who becomes president.

"Preach on.

Fact is, there are a lot of single issue voters in here.  The primary issue I hear in response to those protesting against voting for an administration that's actively, as in right now, supporting a genocide, is women's reproductive rights.

Well, hate to break this to everyone, but Roe's gone and it ain't coming back.  It's now up to the states to decide on abortion, which has little to do with the president, and is often voted on by the people of the state as ballot proposals.  In those cases where the state congress and governor has decided to push foward with their own legislation, the people can still override that with proposals or vote out their legislature.

It's pretty interesting that Biden insisted that if he wins the next election he'll codify Roe.  I assume Harris is making the same claim.  The question is how.  If they don't win the presidency and both houses of congress, then it ain't happening.  Worse, if they win, and the country goes into a financial recession, then that typically results in the party in charge at the time losing the next election cycle in a huge way.  Meaning, Democrats can not only NOT move forward with codifying abortion rights, but they'll lose the next election in a big way, which could possibly make the situation even worse.

And as you said, unless the Democrats are intentionally trying to lose or believe the protest vote isn't big enough to deter their win, then those people refusing to vote for a pro-genocide Democratic candidate aren't an issue anyways.  If Harris loses, it'll be because she either intended to lose, and intended to alienate those protestors,  or she made a major miscalculation in choosing to hold strong on this administration's and the Democratic Party's pro-genocidal stance.

Frankly, having spent a lot of time following this ethnic cleansing, and reviewing the history of this conflict... and after having been insulted by the leftists by being called an anti-Semite for protesting against Israel's actions... there's one thing that still drives me quite nuts; when the left claims they'll continue pushing forward with a two-state solution.  Do we all realize that claims of pursuing a two-state solution go all the way back to 1947?  They've been at it for 77 years now... it's not gonna happen.

For anyone paying attention, Israel has done two things fairly recently:

1. They've dotted the West Bank with ILLEGAL Israel settlements, making that land essentially impossible to host a Palestinian state.  The Israel government has been assisting them in this both financially and militarily.  The US has done nothing to stop it.  In fact, many of the settlers are Americans.  Even if Palestinians were given a state, are we claiming that the settlement growth will just stop, and won't continue proceeding illegally?
2. They've essentially destroyed Gaza.  Completely flattened it.  Which is ironic to hear people claim ""but Donald Trump has promised to flatten Gaza"".  Uh... HELLLOOO everyone, have you not seen the photos?  Have you not seen the videos?  Gaza IS flattened.  Over 2% of the entire population has been killed.  Over 4% injured/maimed.

Of course most of y'all haven't been paying attention... you can't be bothered to actually take the time and look at what's happening there.  You can't be bothered to understand why so many people are SO disturbed by what OUR government has enabled that we can't, in good conscience, vote for them this election, and possibly never again....

How many more tens of thousands of people would be dead today if it wasn't for the Iron Dome system preventing multiple thousands of Iranian, Hamas and Hezbollah missile attacks from hitting civilian centers in Israel?

Sorry, but it's time for a much-needed dose of pragmatic realism...

Peace in the Middle East comes from a two-state solution in Israel and Palestine, the removal of extremist political leaders on all sides, as well as a deterrent/defensive military capability.

"Well not to discount your life... but are you suggesting your life is more important than the lives of 20,000 children in Gaza, 10,000 women, and thousands of civilian men that have been bombed, shot, or starved to death?   That toll in just one year of conflict, and that's just the informal count of the dead.  There are said to potentially be tens of thousands still buried in the rubble.  I won't bother getting into the count of the injured, the percentage of the city that was destroyed (including people losing just about everything they had in the world), or the forced famine due to lack of aid.

I also won't get into the fact that this is now escalating into Lebanon, Syria, and Iran.

But real quick... you be the judge.  What happens if this conflict escalates to all surrounding nations and the US gets dragged into the war?  How many American soldiers are we willing to lose?  How many innocent civilians are we willing to bomb?

You suggest that our ""virtue signaling""... 'our' which includes US women... is worth more than your life and your rights.  Well, to be blunt... I know you as much as I know all those people who died in Gaza.. which is to say, I don't know any of you.  So ... why should you be more important to me than they are?

I'll just point out that many, even potentially most people supporting Gaza also defend women's rights to choose.  I mean, afterall, these are the same left leaning voters that would have voted Harris if not for this issue of the Democratic party and the Democratic presidential administration actively supporting an ongoing genocide...

It's weird you place all the blame on these particular voters though.  Are you suggesting that the Democratic party couldn't have supported both US women AND Palestinian civilians?  That they couldn't have at least offered a bone?  That they couldn't have constrained themselves from calling these voters, those who called out Israel's abhorrent actions or defended Palestinians, anti-Semites.  That includes Jews btw... which I don't know if you're Jewish.. .but that's quite an insult to call Jews anti-Semites...aka Jew haters.

Those politicians are completely aware of why this group is opting not to vote for them.  They know full well, but they still refuse to change their stance.  Why is that?  Why don't you cast any blame at them?

I guess my question is... why are you putting women's bodily rights above the rights of nearly 2.2 million people who are currently living in a severe situation?  Why don't you find the second issue as important as the first... choosing to stand with those of us who find both issues important, and demanding the Democrat party change their policy or else risk losing your vote.

\_\_\_

Edit: I'll just add.  We passed abortion rights in my state.  Why is it the people in my state's fault that your state restricted abortion rights?  Maybe the people of your state need to work on getting an amendment passed, or maybe a change in leadership?  

As much as I think a lot of people believe Harris will magically fix abortion rights, or codify them at the federal level... no one thinks Democrats will get a majority in both of houses of congress, needed to legalize abortion at the federal level.  Therefore, I fail to see what Harris could do that Biden couldn't have already done.  I also fail to see what Trump could do.  He equally doesn't have access to ban abortion at the federal level since he doesn't have the necessary congressional votes.  

It would take two conservative Supreme Court Justices retiring or dying in the next 4 years to enable Harris to replace both with liberal justices who will re-enable Roe.  Chances of that happening are extremely slim.  In fact, it's more likely to happen 4-8 years from now than it is to happen over the next 4.  Therefore, it's far more critical for Democrats to get a victory in 2028 than it is to get an issue in 2024 on that particular issue.

"\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Oh, and btw... it's not exactly a single issue.  There are quite a few issues rolled into this.  You can include out of control military spending.

[U.S. Military Spending/Defense Budget 1960-2024](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/USA/united-states/military-spending-defense-budget)  (Highest on record)

You can include the Israel lobby that seems to be directing the US' Israel policy using funding from the unknowing US taxpayer, laundered through Israel in our multi-billion dollar aid packages.  Did any of y'all know the US taxpayer has funded Israel to the tune of about $350 billion... that we know of?  That doesn't even include direct US military intervention on Israel's behalf in the region.  It doesn't include purchases of Israeli military technology and spying insights... no doubt at a pretty hefty upcharge.

You can include Iraq.  Is everyone in here unaware that Israel was heavily lobbying the US to attack Iraq in 2002, just prior to the US invasion?  That war is said to have cost the US between $1 trillion and $3 trillion, lead to the death of thousands of US soldiers, and hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis.  I'm sure if I looked into it a little further, it'd become evident that Israel had some major financial benefits come from that war.

Have we noticed what Israel was doing right now?  They're escalating conflicts with Lebanon and Iran, and have been for some time now lobbying the US to attack Iran.  Would anyone here like the US to get involved in another multi-trillion dollar multi-year war that leaves hundreds of thousands of more civilians dead?

And these are just the issues with this administration that relate to Israel.  What about US policies like hiring shit tons of government workers to prop up the economy?  Government workers, generally, aren't very productive in the long term, save for education.   Where I think many of those jobs are coming from are military and weapons production.  Ironically, we have to supply the weapons to Israel, which is paid for by US taxpayers... so taxpayers are massively funding the US military industrial complex.  Again, no doubt at a nice premium for those companies.

Democrats have lead us much deeper into debt.  Outside of the pandemic, we're currently sitting at the highest deficit number on record... during what's claimed to be a hot economy, and that's after counting inflation.  Typically in hot economies, the deficit is near its record lows.  That absolutely is not the case today.  Sure, Republicans are often just as bad, if not worse... but that doesn't absolve Democrats.

How about Elon Musk? We all love Elon Musk around here, right?  Y'all do realize who passed the policies to subsidize and prop up Musk's companies and his wealth right?  The IRA was one of the largest handouts to a single auto company in the history of the automotive industry.  It doesn't take a genius to look at where the lion's share of the EV tax credit money went to.  It went to Tesla just as they started to see their demand drop off a cliff in the US and their car inventories start to build.  Musk's company was in trouble, so the Democrats bailed him out.

How about SpaceX?  It seems like SpaceX has become a bottomless pit in terms of government funding.  It also seems the government has been more than willing to allow him to launch as many Starlink satellites as he wants, which not only gives SpaceX a huge competitive advantage in global internet service, but also potentially creates a massive anti-Trust issue if this leads to other providers folding, or trying to launch their own satellite constellation.  Who's going to launch their satellites for them?  Their direct competitor??

We're all pissed about Elon Musk using his immense wealth to influence politics... but it was the Democrats that built his power and his wealth... and even after the man has attacked Democrats, they still continued to support him and his companies with the IRA and new massive grants to SpaceX.  The Democratic party helped create the devil by picking a corporate winner and telling investors ""we won't let this company fail, so you're free to invest and hyperinflate the stock, and make its CEO and largest shareholder the richest man on the planet"".  Must turned around and used his new found wealth to support Republicans.

So no... this isn't just a single issue.

"See my Edit in the comment above.

Technically it's been happening since 1947... so some voters were alive at the start.  It sounds like the person I responded to is in a far off state, so again, why do they get priority in who we care for?

Interesting enough, many of the protest votes are Arabs and Jews... who have family in those regions who are being affected.  Jews without families there are being impacted by the constant equivocation of Israelis / Zionists to the Jewish ethnicity.  So yes, it actually does matter.

The problem with your argument is that it's not simply a conflict.  It's currently devolved into an ethnic cleansing / genocide.  The conflict people are protesting about isn't just the conflict itself, but the US' funding and support of that conflict with their tax dollars.

Based on your response, sorry to say, those whining the loudest about the protest voters seem to be the least informed on the matter.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

">Is that really the only thing that matters to you?

Things that matter to me:

* Maintaining a livable climate on Earth for at least my lifetime but hopefully longer
* Preserving what is left of American democracy, and restoring the rest
* Protecting the rights and freedoms of my fellow Americans, including but not limited to women, LGTBQ people, racial minorities, atheists, and sexual minorities.
* Working towards universal healthcare coverage, so that being healthy is a right and not a privilege.
* Creating more affordable housing so that the middle class American dream is within reach of more people.
* Legalizing cannabis and ending the racist war on drugs.
* Having a stable and functional economy and a tax system that supports the middle class instead of further empowering only the richest oligarchs.
* Having a steady leader who isn't a crazy deplorable fascist piece of garbage who can work towards global geopolitical stability and, dare to dream, maybe even some form of peaceful coexistence.

As such, the decision to vote for Harris and reject Trump was the most obvious and easy choice of my life so far.

Hypothetically speaking, even IF one was a single-issue voter on Israel/Palestine (which, if so... uh, why..?) Harris is still the better option than Trump because it's no secret that Trump doesn't care for arab muslims here in America and he was already confirmed that he would give Netanyahu carte blanche to do whatever the fuck he wants in Gaza, Lebanon and the West Bank.

"A bit from the Op/Ed:

> We still assume that we are witnessing two campaigns for the presidency. But what if we are witnessing one campaign and one slow-motion coup, whose organizers need to go through the motion of campaigning for the plan to work? Since winning at the ballot box does not matter, taking a break to listen to Pavarotti isn‚Äôt a problem; conversely, a festival of racism and conspiracy theories, as at Madison Square Garden, is not about convincing any undecided voter, but motivating committed Trumpists to go along with another coup attempt.
> 
> To be sure, this can also sound like conspiracy theory. The point is not prediction, but to call for preparedness. After all, there is an overwhelming number of reasons why, should Trump lose, he will once more try to take power anyway. His followers have long been primed to assume that evil Democrats will steal the election. The unchecked racism fits into a logic of far-right populism more generally: far-right populists claim that they, and they alone, represent what they call ‚Äúthe silent majority‚Äù or ‚Äúthe real people‚Äù (the very expression Trump used on January 6 to address his supporters).
> 
> If far-right populists do not win elections, the reason can only be that the majority of the electorate was silenced by someone (liberal elites, of course). Or, for that matter, people who are not ‚Äúreal people‚Äù ‚Äì fake Americans ‚Äì must have participated in the election to bring about an illegitimate outcome. This explains the Republican obsession with finding proof of ‚Äúnon-citizen‚Äù voting.
> 
> . . .
> 
> Most worryingly, Maga members have been primed to resort to violence. Trump and his allies ‚Äì including the world‚Äôs richest man, who just happens to be a rightwing extremist ‚Äì have framed the election as an apocalyptic battle. If Democrats win, Musk has claimed, there will not be any proper elections ever after; they will bring in more foreigners to secure a permanent majority. It is already half forgotten that Trump held his first major rally this election cycle in Waco, Texas.
> 
> Who knows whether Trump can really mobilize large numbers of people on the streets; it might be enough to prolong a sense of chaos. Vance has claimed that the 2020 election was problematic, because so many citizens had doubts about its ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù and Democrats prevented a ‚Äúdebate‚Äù which the country needed to have (never mind that Republicans had created the doubts in the first place). How long a debate would Vance like, exactly? Incidents like the infamous Brooks Brothers riot, where rightwingers in fancy suits stopped a recount in Florida in 2000, might accompany this debate.

The logic is very simple:

Mega-rich usually need money from elsewhere firsts in order to become, then stay exceedingly rich.  That can from a parent or from strangers called customers 

On that alone, Musk and Theil's (let's assume them the Batman and Robin of this --- wait --- Joker and Two-Face) billionaire mindset would seemingly think everything -- when it comes to large groups of people -- is for sale.  It's not.

They rely on a rudimentary 2-step model in this election:

1) ignore your observations

2) only trust mine

Tomorrow, when Republican integrity (heartbeat) is up for grabs (or at least the EKG machine is sounding pretty uh-oh) Thiel, Musk, and other forces that can dependably rely on the only thing they know how to do -- find money.

"""Complicit"" to me is the wrong word - it suggests that there's some sort of leadership function quietly ensuring that anything concerning Trump is quietly dropped.

Instead, I would invite you to consider this:  If you've ever done anything as part of a team - whether that's a sport or some project at school or work - how well would it have gone if 30% of your team had been quietly sabotaging it at every step of the way?

Not openly, you understand.  They know they're outnumbered and doing anything openly is practically asking to be sanctioned in some way.  But quietly engineering things so any task the team might undertake would fail.

Now consider this: Trump's core of voters is thought to be about 30% of the country.  If the demographics in federal government are reflected in this - I think we can all see where this is going.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"I think the issue is that the democrats are in a rough spot. If they try to fully prosecute all this foreign interference they are admitting that an electorally significant chunk of voters can be manipulated by the media and it‚Äôs possible to compromise an entire political party.

This would be a major win for Putin, possibly even bigger than getting trump back in the white house. I think the coup is getting more obvious because they are daring the democrats to call them out. Democrats would rather win an election with some shred of legitimacy and try to deal with this behind the scenes.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

defeating trump this cycle will certainly not stamp out the threat, and i have no doubt fresh options will continue to audition for the role between now and 2028. but without the beloved grifting racist to bridge that gulf between the elite and the voters who enable them, the conservatives are gonna have a tricky time getting the numbers.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

I agree that Trump ultimately is a pawn, and much smarter people have been using him for their benefits his whole life. That doesn't detract from Trump's ability as a grifter. He knows his marks, and can get them to believe anything. It doesn't matter if everyone else can see it, his marks will never realize they're being conned. No one else in the GOP has that kind of talent. Not to the level of having half of the voting base falling for it",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"You're both right. 

Trump is a very good conman. He does - even if he's lost it with age and expanding narcissism - have a knack for winning people over (see example below). But Trump has only ever conned for the benefit of himself. For money and power and ego. He's never had a broader goal to impact society beyond his own house. 

That's where big-vision bodies like the Heritage Foundation and Christian Nationalist politicians (Pence, Cruz, etc) come in. They see Trump as a Trojan Horse. They can climb inside his larger-than-life persona and his large-scale grifting network, and gain entry to the most powerful building in the world. From there, they'll steer Trump, not the other way around. 



*(Example, as mentioned above)* I remember listening to a podcast in 2016 about Trump's affiliates courting the big money donors for Trump's campaign. (I'm going to get some details wrong I'm sure) The Koch brothers  had already refused to meet Trump because they knew the kind of person he was. But a friend of theirs was considering a sit-down with Trump. Charles Koch warned the friend (let's call him ""Friend"") not to because Friend was opposed to Trump's political stances. But Friend went anyway. After the meeting, Friend called Koch in a kind of a daze. Friend said Trump knew all about him and spent their time together praising Friend and referring to the history and accomplishments of Friend and saying why he was vital to Trump's campaign. Friend was blown away, mesmerized by the way Trump made him feel like the most important person in the world. Koch said that was WHY he didn't want Friend to meet Trump. Because he knew Trump's ways and how persuasive, manipulative, and effective they are.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

Elon has himself admitted that this is going to be bad and everyone's going to have to deal with some economic pain for a while. Real winning argument there.

And as for inflation - if US government spending is what's causing it, why is it lower in the US than almost every other developed nation?

"A bombshell poll for the Des Moines Register in Iowa now shows¬†[Kamala Harris](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/03/donald-trump-kamala-harris-election-campaign-live-updates/)¬†taking a three-point lead in the state, which Donald Trump won in his 2016 and 2020 campaigns.

What makes it hard to dismiss is that it comes from pollster Ann Selzer who has made a career out of defying conventional wisdom ‚Äì and coming out on top.

Ms Selzer has collected accolades throughout her decades conducting the Register‚Äôs polls, with admirers labelling her ‚ÄúIowa‚Äôs polling queen,‚Äù ‚Äúthe polling Cassandra of Des Moines‚Äù, and ‚Äúthe best pollster in politics‚Äù.

For her part, the 68-year-old has not got carried away with the hype.

She is a self-described old-school pollster who keeps her feet on the ground, following the data and nothing else. There is no ‚Äúsecret sauce‚Äù beyond that, she insists.

The approach took her to national acclaim when she accurately predicted that a first-senator by the name of¬†[Barack Obama](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/10/26/the-obamas-arent-saving-kamala-harris-theyre-exposing-just/)¬†would beat frontrunner Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, in the Iowa caucuses in 2008.

Her forecast sparked reactions ranging from scepticism to outright mockery when it was published.¬† A member of the Clinton campaign even called up to complain.

‚Äú\[PBS anchor\] Judy Woodruff was interviewing me that day and said, ‚ÄòHow did you assume this? Why did you assume this?‚Äô‚Äù Ms Selzer recalled to Politico.

‚ÄúI go, ‚ÄòI assumed nothing.‚Äô My data told me this was what was going to happen.‚Äù

Ms Selzer‚Äôs latest poll has sent a shockwave through a race notably devoid of surprises. Nate Silver, a fellow pollster, recently complained that his peers were hedging their bets by¬†[forecasting a close race](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/0/who-win-2024-us-election-expert-predictions-next-president/)¬†‚Äì the Register‚Äôs prediction has burst through that consensus.

If once the forecast might have been greeted with disbelief, Ms Selzer‚Äôs heavyweight credentials mean that it has to be taken seriously.

One of her strengths is thought to be that she is based in Iowa, rather than Washington, DC or New York like other big-name pollsters, and knows how to reach regular Americans.

While a long-time resident of the Hawkeye State, Ms Selzer was born a few states along, in Kansas.

Even if she might have seemed destined for life as a pollster ‚Äì conducting a survey of ‚Äúneighbourhood moms‚Äù at the age of five, according to the Wall Street Journal ‚Äì she undertook a pre-medical course at the University of Kansas before finding her heart lay in data.

She took up a communications theory and research program at the University of Iowa, followed by an academic fellowship in Britain and a stint on Capitol Hill, then returned to the state permanently.

While at the Des Moines Register in 1987, Ms Selzer dug through the newspaper‚Äôs polling data and questioned its conclusion that George H. W. Bush would beat Bob Dole in the Republican caucuses.

‚ÄúI believe the Register is publishing that George Bush will win the caucus, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true,‚Äù she told her editor. The Register changed its prediction to Dole ‚Äì correctly ‚Äì while Bush came in third.

The only sure thing in today's politics is the unpredictability, which makes historical probabilities less certain than ever. Iowa was still red 12yrs ago, and it was a huge win by the nations first black president. I wouldn't say people thought he was going to landslide Iowa at that time.

I don't trust the polls bc they've been unable to adapt to the rapid change of how our society operates; how it publishes and absorbs current events, and who/when/where/how polling organizations reach people. But once again, that is not an indication that a poll can't be accurate. 

We're in uncharted waters where precedent means less than ever in modern American politics. Either one might take Iowa by 10-15pts, or either one might squeak out a victory by 1-2pts. Another noteworthy mention is that polls have been trying to self correct after Trump's unexpected win 8yrs ago, so there's a chance they are skewed in Trump's favor in contradiction to the reality on the ground.

"They're trapped between a rock and a hard place on the matter, but the fundamentals are as follows:


 * The Democrats have assessed that the centre-right is more important to gaining victory in the election than single-issue pro-Palestinian voters. They are likely correct in their assessment.


 * Democratic policy is likely to involve a slow, careful, carrot-and-stick approach to Israel, threatening them with sanctions while offering the carrot of US-backed normalisation of relations with Israel's neighbours (that is to say, offering incentives for said neighbours to normalise relations). It won't be fast or radical, but it may work.


 * By contrast, a Republican victory is likely to see the US *de facto* outright encourage further ethnic cleansing and cultural erasure of the Palestinian people.


 * The Israeli right are desperately hoping for a Republican victory, which will let them act with relative impunity.


 * A Democratic victory in the US means a greater likelihood of Israeli atrocities winding down, whereas a Trump victory will likely see escalation.


 * There are no other realistic scenarios but a Democratic or Republican victory.


It follows from these points that anyone who is actually serious about using their vote to aid the Palestinian people should vote for the Democrats. To not do so is functionally indistinguishable from showing approval of Israeli actions.


I am not American. None of this will directly affect me, but the correct course of action is frankly obvious. It is not a game, and there are no prizes for not voting for the Democrats on principle.

">your other points do not matter at all if this one is wrong.

How so?

Read them without the first point and the conclusion is surely the same for pro-Palestinian voters, perhaps even to the point that I should have cut out that point entirely.

We can quibble about whether the Democrats ought to court the centre and centre-right or try to energise a more left-wing base, but that's just debating strategy for victory. None of your principles matter unless you attain victory first, and rightly or wrongly that is the assessment the Democrats have made. At the end of the day, if Trump and the Republicans get in, more Palestinians will likely die than will if the US elects Harris and the Democrats. There is even a non-zero chance that the US under Trump will encourage the Israeli government to green-light the colonisation and ethnic cleansing of Gaza in its entirety.

The presumption is that with these activists she doesn‚Äôt win, but if she gets enough middle ground swing voters she might win.

The US has, yes with some lapses especially of late, generally landed on the right side of history re: regional powers pushing their neighbors around and/or persecuting minorities.  If the Dems stood up for Palestinians' right to not get ethnic cleansed because terrorists attacked Israel a year ago it would underscore that difference with their opponents, who don't value that tradition and in fact have stated a desire to do it here.

They have been trying to stop it to the extent they are politically capable, but there has been a lot of qualification of that stance because they're also trying not to alienate the voters who would see outright stopping support for Israel or twisting their arm too hard to get them to stop (which probably wouldn't even work anyway) as sympathy for the terrorists or antisemitism.

the lack of solidarity is the problem. if these different factions stuck to each other, they could sway the democrats to cater to ALL of them, instead of only some of them.

This paper examines Donald Trump‚Äôs character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America‚Äôs most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington‚Äôs humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln‚Äôs moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump‚Äôs conduct‚Äîboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6th‚Äîreveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump‚Äôs character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.

"One thing this election is making very clear is that the patriarchy still exists. In recent years of anti-feminist anti-woke sentiment spreading across the internet we've seen a revival of Limbaugh-like rhetoric, reinforced by man-splainer-in-chief Jordan Peterson and his incel followers. We've seen backlash from the #meToo movement ""going too far"", while putting our second alleged rapist on the Supreme Court. Half of America is seriously considering putting a man who is an adjudicated sexual assault perpetrator back in The White House.

Vice President Harris has somewhere between a 15 and a 20 point lead on Donald Trump among women voters. Conversely he has almost the same margin among male voters. This election, more than anything else, is divided along gender lines. The majority of male voters in America are literally stripping the women in their lives of basic human rights and basic freedoms, and as this article makes clear they won't stop at reproductive rights. Women are out there hiding their votes from their husbands and employers for fear of reprisals. This *is* Gilead folks, this *is* already a dystopian nightmare for American women.

If you're a man and you have any woman in your life that you care about, take a moment to consider your position.

Exactly. However, this situation being described is not a healthy situation. So, given that, what do you do to exercise your right to vote your conscience?

The ads do not advocate lying, per se, by the way. They sidestep that. ""Did you vote the right way?"" ""Sure did!""

People in toxic relationships need to be reminded that their vote is secret. They need to be told how to request a new ballot in vote-by-mail states. We don't live in a world where every spouse can have a reasonable conversation about these things.

"There‚Äôs no social safety net here.  A woman who wanted to stay home and care for her family, and thought when younger she was marrying a great man for herself, may as she grows older and has children start to have serious concerns and find she is very different from her husband in ways that matter a lot to her.

Now, if the husband is a decent man, they can have a discussion about both of their concerns, either reach a compromise or disagree but support each other, or decide to part ways with irreconcilable differences but mutual respect, agreeing to share time with the children if there are any.

But there is the issue of her lack of income.  Maybe there‚Äôs some money set aside and she can go back to school.  Maybe her family is supportive and will help out.

But usually not.  The divorce is a shame on her family, they try to convince her to stay in the marriage, they do not offer to help her start anew.

If the marriage is abusive, and the wife has no secondary education to fall back on, and no one to help her get away safely, she could flee on her own, but if there are young children involved she won‚Äôt want to put them in peril.

She‚Äôs stuck.  It‚Äôs hard to remain and it‚Äôs terrifying to leave.  *just get along, at least til the kids are grown and can fend for themselves*.

My mom was raised very religious.  She married a man from a good family, but that man was an abusive psychopath.  He‚Äôd beat her up, the cops would haul him away for the night, then he‚Äôd be back with promises to her and me that he would change.  A week or so later, he‚Äôd be back to smashing windows and her face.

Her parents told her to stay and pray, it was her fault the marriage wasn‚Äôt working.  She stayed, she prayed.  Then one night after he beat her up again, she saw me hiding behind a chair (he never hit me), in that moment it struck her how I was being affected, and she was done with it.

Democrats as a group definitely do provide guidance on how to get out of domestic violence and other bad situations -- which, ironically given your opinion, often requires lying to an abusive spouse and doing other things in secret like saving money that are easily justified when they're in service of saving your life and those of your children.

"Well, it's way more simple and less conspiratorial than that I'd wager, which is simply that polls got scared after undercounting Trump's margins twice in 2016 and 2020, so they harshly overcorrected in 2022 and 2024. There's also the fact that a lot of Republican pollsters, especially after 2020 with Trump going absolutely insane over J6, and due to the hardcore consolidation of power in the party behind Trump after McCarthy went to Maralago to kiss the ring, that a lot of less reputable (and more reputable) Conservative leaning pollsters actually being straight-up bullied by Trump and his surrogates into giving actually BS stats.

The numbers themselves might not be ""false"", but what we're seeing in both Republican pollsters tweaking the #s and everyone else under/overshooting Trumps numbers is the changes in how they're weighing return data and trying to sculpt it to fit actual census data. 

Selzer explains this when she's recently been talking about her bunker-buster Iowa poll with Harris +3, pollsters are trying to hard over-correct for previous cycles' weights being off, which is in turn causing the current weights to be off because the invisible energization of the voters has swung in the opposite direction again and they're still correcting for the bygone movement:

[https://youtu.be/zguy5q1lfXc?si=mnnOdm7rtvIshoE4](https://youtu.be/zguy5q1lfXc?si=mnnOdm7rtvIshoE4)

Something I'd like to note on an insane hopium note as well, *she specifically says that Harris' numbers in this Iowa poll were* ***EVEN FUCKING HIGHER*** *than the +3 presented after weighing the data*. 

We probably won't know what those numbers were, but the fact that they corrected the data to give Harris *less* support than more is **very, very bad for Trump**.

"‚ÄúFrankly, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if me and Trump won the normal gay guy vote, because again, they just want to be left the hell alone.""

Ahh yes. Normal gay guys who just want to be left alone can't wait to vote for the political party that 1) criminalized homosexuality through targeted anti-sodomy laws, 2) tried to pass a Constitutional amendment defining marriage as one-man-one-woman (DOMA), 3) voted unanimously against the repeal of DADT along party lines time and time again, 4) banned drag queens, 5) banned books with LGBTQ content, 6) struck federal anti-discrimination policies under the Trump Administration, 7) and used every lever of social, cultural, and political influence at both state and federal level to marginalize the gay community - all within my lifetime.

Nevermind that Project 2025 aims to gut LGBTQ protections, prioritize families ""comprised of a married mother, father, and their children,"" and eliminate any federal policies that promote LGBTQ equality or assist single parents - explicitly stating that, ""Only heterosexual, two-parent families are safe for children."" Nice. I didn't get my fill of being a second-class citizen for the last 40 years or so. Let's go back to the worst parts of that timeline.

Surely man of principle Donald J. Trump would never sacrifice normal gay guys on the altar of the GOP's largest voting bloc - conservative fundamentalist Christian nationalists - without a second thought if it were politically expedient or marginally profitable. Surely the same hyper-partisan SCOTUS that just overturned Roe v. Wade wouldn't overturn Obergefell v. Hodges - even though the same right-wing organizations responsible for successfully advocating Dobbs v. Jackson have already filed amicus briefs to challenge Obergefell citing the same legal reasoning.

"There has long been a contingent of wealthier, white gay men that have prioritized respectability over solidarity. Amid the Lavender Scare of the 1950s and 60s, the Mattachine Society, once at the vanguard of the fight for gay rights, sought quiet assimilation, distancing itself from nonconforming members to avoid further scrutiny. In the aftermath of Stonewall, many distanced themselves from trans activists and radicals, fearing they‚Äôd hinder mainstream acceptance. During the AIDS crisis, grassroots organizers struggled for support as privileged voices pushed for quieter, less confrontational advocacy. When marriage equality took center stage, it further sidelined urgent issues affecting marginalized queer people. Today, trans-exclusionary gays echo this history, continuing a pattern that fractures the community and leaves its most vulnerable members behind, all in the name of respectability politics.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

Trump is terrible for everyone not named Trump because everything is transactional for Trump.,2024_11_05,05_45_33
"For all his endless rambling nonsense, Donald Trump's message can be boiled down to a simple lie: If one group of people does well, it must necessarily be at the expense of another. Zero-sum thinking is literally classified as a logical fallacy, and the reason why should be obvious given a moment's thought. If your neighbor buys a new car, for instance, it doesn't mean you can't have one. Trump's relentless repetition of the zero-sum fallacy, however, has sadly convinced many voters that two groups of people are at odds with each other: men and women. 

Trump has already done immeasurable harm to women's rights and will do significantly more if he's returned to the White House. And in the process, he will not do a single thing to make men's lives better.

In a poll of swing states in early September, CBS News found many voters see this as a ""girls v. boys"" election. In Michigan, 77% of voters believe Vice President Kamala Harris is for women's interests, but only 55% believe she will work for men. A whopping 81%, however, believe Trump is for men's interests, though most ‚Äî 54% ‚Äî correctly understand Trump is against women. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin voters showed similar results, with large numbers of voters believing a candidate could be for men or women but not both. 

It's frustrating because the truth is much simpler and also doesn't put these two genders at loggerheads: Harris is better for both men and women, and Trump is much, much worse for people of any gender. As Sarah Lazarus wrote at Off Message, ""Kamala Harris will be a president for all Americans,"" whether ""they‚Äôre sports guys or tech bros."" Financial experts of all political stripes agree that the issue of the economy, which a majority of voters rate their number one issue, isn't even a contest. Harris will continue Democratic policies that have brought down inflation and decreased unemployment, and her proposals could lower housing and medical costs. Trump, on the other hand, wants to slap a 20% tariff on imported goods, which would functionally be a massive sales tax that would send inflation spiraling. He also wants to deport millions of workers, which most experts believe would cause an economic crash. 

Even Trump's biggest booster, billionaire Elon Musk, agrees that Trump's plans would tank the U.S. economy, causing what, by Musk's own admission, sounds like a second Great Depression. He, as I noted in Standing Room Only, has embraced fascistic logic that crashing the economy would be a purifying ritual that would supposedly allow him and Trump to rebuild from the ashes, but of course, actual economists think that view is completely unfeasible. It should go without saying, but an economic crash doesn't just hurt women, but men. 

What Trump is offering men is not concrete or material improvements to their lives. It's just vibes. As Paul Waldman recently wrote in his newsletter, Trump tells men ""you are oppressed."" The only ""solution"" Trump offers is permission to act out toxic masculinity ""in the most belligerent way possible."" But in terms of what will actually make the lives of men better, Trump gives them ""precisely nothing."" It's worse than that, as I argued last week. Being a misogynist boor may offer temporary gratification, but in the long or even medium term, it will just make men's problems worse. If they're feeling lonely or alienated, being a jerk results in being shunned even more, especially by women. This downward spiral of self-destruction isn't subtle; it is why there are so many ""divorced dude energy"" jokes about Trump voters. But voting for Trump won't make your wife come back to you. 

Trump is a con artist, as evidenced by the eye-popping half-billion judgment against him in New York for decades of business fraud. Tricking men into voting against their self-interest using cheap appeals to toxic masculinity is very on-brand for him. But, as Timothy Noah of the New Republic pointed out, this has been true of Republicans generally for decades. ""Democratic officeholders are much likelier to do what voters want than Republican officeholders,"" he writes, noting that GOP-controlled state governments ""routinely ignore voter preferences"" but Democratic majorities ""work much harder to do what voters want."" Studies show Republican voters are often more ignorant of the policies their elected officials pass, suggesting that they are easier to manipulate with empty identity-based appeals. 

Trump's base of insecure and ignorant male voters isn't just useful electorally but offers up a steady supply of marks for shady MAGA-related hustles. Trump took time out of his ""busy"" campaign schedule in August and September to roll out a cryptocurrency scheme, with partners whose profiles were comically on-the-nose: Chase Herro, who calls himself a ""dirtbag of the internet"" and Zachary Folkman, who sells ""how to pick up women"" classes online. Herro doesn't hide what he's doing, either, calling cryptocurrency a ""scam"" and he doesn't care ""if it goes to zero"" because he'll ""make so much money trading these f‚Äî-ing coins in and out."" 

Crypto and MAGA are made for each other because both prey largely on male insecurity with false reassurances to their targets that they're secretly the smart ones for buying into this snake oil that normies ‚Äî often portrayed as middle-aged moms ‚Äî turn their noses up to. Some on the left are trying to compete with MAGA's empty pandering by arguing that real masculinity is rooted in the courage to reject bigoted nonsense. In a recent newsletter, Anand Giridharadas tried his hand at such an argument: 

""Men worthy of the word don‚Äôt depend for their self-esteem on the crushing and marginalizing of Others. Men worthy of the word don‚Äôt need women to be locked in the fourteenth century legally to feel whole. Men worthy of the word don‚Äôt hand over the keys to the future to billionaires who pull the strings.""

Certainly, a substantive group of men are stirred by the argument that ""real men reject fascism."" The latest polls show about 45% of men say they back Harris over Trump. Harris is even 7 points up over Trump with college-educated men, though it's a full 27-point spread towards Harris with college-educated women. But it's also telling that, as with elections past, it seems women are turning out in larger numbers. Politico reports a 10-point gender gap in early voting, as women have cast 55% of ballots, and men only 45%. It's resulting in a major tantrum in right-wing media, with Republican pundits accusing women of somehow betraying men by voting for Harris. In reality, men voting for Trump are betraying the women in their lives, by voting against their basic rights. 

Perhaps this is why women turn out more than men: the stakes feel higher for women. It would be nice if both men and women understood the serious economic threat of another Trump presidency, but a confusing media environment has obscured that. But on the ""culture war"" issues, the situation is clear. Despite all the hysterical proclamations about emasculation, men have nothing to fear from President Kamala Harris. On the flip side, however, Trump has already done immeasurable harm to women's rights and will do significantly more if he's returned to the White House. And in the process, he will not do a single thing to make men's lives better.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

There's a simple reason people think this way (beyond base-level one has one set of genitals and the other has another).  And this article does a decent job of highlighting part of it - when you look through the examples of what the Harris is going to do for men given, they're pretty much non-existent.  It's just a lot of here is why Trump would be worse for the country.  

Then there is outreach like this, as mentioned in the article:

>As Sarah Lazarus wrote at Off Message, ""Kamala Harris will be a president for all Americans,"" whether ""they‚Äôre sports guys or tech bros."" 

Or the ads that basically told men ""you know your penis won't fall off if you vote for a woman?!"" 

And the Harris campaign website:

Women, veterans, seniors, lgbtq, native americans, faith community, ethnic community, the disabled etc.  That's great - but if the Harris campaign is struggling with men, and they want to get their votes...you wouldn't know that.

Same with the democratic party platform.

I think the democratic party and the ""left"" in general have a blind spot when it comes to men.  They're so interested in fighting the patriarchy and male privilege, they're uncomfortable or just unable to deal with men as a group that actually has needs, and think and talk to them like they do other groups.  

So that leaves a politically moderate male voter looking at a a choice between the democratic party that comes off cold, and a republican party that seems to be acting like the WWE version of masculinity as a counter-point.  It isn't a hard decision for most, but in a lot of case will lead to people staying home...which honestly, might be by design as the Harris campaign knows that less men voting will likely be better for her.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"It's very disheartening to see this so downvoted. It's 100% the correct take, and  it feels like the current collective left has this view of men that treats them like an entire different species. 

There's absolutely no empathy for the real people that are facing real challenges every day, and then have the audacity to either reject or be apathetic about a candidate that in every sense comes across as mildly vilifying them for no other reason than their gender. It's pretty disappointing from a party that preaches equity and social support.

I am a leftist, and my position has been that fascism cannot be allowed to take hold in this country. The left *needs* to address this, or we're going to keep seeing these closer-than-they-should be elections simply because the other side just acknowledges men's issues.

"I wish people would stop underestimating the harm his plan could cause.  Sowing enough chaos poses tremendous danger. It continues to deepen the divide between we the people, something our foreign adversaries deeply desire. It also encourages lone wolf terrorism. 

For anyone unfamiliar, there is a popular book in far-right communities called The Turner Diaries(1). It essentially lays out the blueprint for how lone wolf terrorism(2) should take place. It advocates for ""leader less resistance"" (3) in which cells function in small or singular groups. No more than 2 or at absolute max, 3 members. Any more than that, and it is guaranteed someone has flipped. 

The OKC bombing was carried out using The Turner Diaries formula. Hundreds of peoples lives were changed forever that day. Kids in the daycare were murdered and McVeigh basically chalked it up to collateral damage. The bull horn of radicalization is blasting right now. Chris Dorner(4) essentially shut down one of the largest armed forces in the world (LAPD) for 9 days with his lone wolf terrorism. Granted, Dorner wanted to call attention to injustice, and he is not a perfect 1 to 1 comparison, his methods can be easily replicated. 

Untold damage and destruction can and will be carried out by singular entities or very small groups.

This one is easy to solve. Capitol is a special security zone for the duration of the vote count. All official delegates/electors are voted for already, their identities are a matter of record. Place a .50cal machine gun at a security checkpoint, and force every person entering the complex to identify themselves against the list of electors and congressional representatives.

If the VP were able to determine whether the objection was ""in order"", they would be making their own *sole* opinion as to whether the objection was made according to law.

All the presiding officer gets to determine is if the objection is one of those two conditions; whether the objection is *valid*, which is to say ‚Äúdeciding if the objection raised is *true* or not‚Äù, is the authority reserved to the two Houses and that question is extremely different than whether or not an objection is on one of those two grounds. Otherwise, a distinct faction could say ‚ÄúWe object because we don‚Äôt like the outcome‚Äù explicitly and the section I cited would be meaningless.

What donald was trying to do was have pence send the certificates back to the states, claiming ‚Äúthere is some question here‚Äù, and that scenario is not under consideration in our discussion.

"The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.

This paper examines Donald Trump‚Äôs character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America‚Äôs most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington‚Äôs humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln‚Äôs moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump‚Äôs conduct‚Äîboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6th‚Äîreveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump‚Äôs character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.

They should just have an ad where a bunch of young female voters saying voting for Trump is a deal killer for dating.,2024_11_05,05_45_33
"A George Clooney-narrated advert encouraging male Kamala Harris voters to lie to their Trump-supporting friends is being broadcast ahead of the election.

The 30-second clip, released by a Left-wing Christian organisation, urges men to think of how voting for the Republican will affect the women in their lives and ‚Äúthe people you care about the most‚Äù.

It was released after a¬†[controversial advert from the same group](http://v/), narrated by Clooney‚Äôs Oceans 11 co-star Julia Roberts, encouraged women to keep their votes secret from their husbands. Critics branded it ‚Äúnauseating‚Äù and ‚Äúcondescending‚Äù.

The Clooney advert shows a group of men walking into a polling station, one of whom says: ‚ÄúCome on boys, let‚Äôs Make America Great Again‚Äù, referring to¬†[the Trump campaign slogan](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/10/28/donald-trumps-new-york-invasion-exposed-the-maga-madness-po/).

One of the men stands in a polling booth with his pen hovering over the former president‚Äôs name, as the actor narrates: ‚ÄúBefore you cast your vote in this election, think about how it will impact the people you care about the most.‚Äù

The man looks at a picture of his family on his phone, while his daughter shouts ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù at him.

‚ÄúRemember, you can vote any way you want. And no one will ever know,‚Äù Clooney continues.

At this point, the man ‚Äì looking his friend in the eye on the other side of the booth ‚Äì checks the box for Ms Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz.

‚ÄúDo your patriotic duty?‚Äù the friend asks. ‚ÄúYou bet I did brother‚Äù, the man responds, lifting his daughter in his arms and looking into her eyes.

‚ÄúWhat happens in the booth, stays in the booth. Vote Harris Walz,‚Äù Clooney concludes.

The advert is a direct¬†[appeal to male voters](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/10/14/kamala-harris-campaign-cant-stop-patronising-american-men/)¬†over whom Trump maintains a considerable lead.

An NBC News poll on Sunday gave the Republican an 18-point advantage among men, while Ms Harris had a¬†[16-point lead among women](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/03/election-poll-iowa-kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump/).

The Julia Roberts advert, released earlier this week, shows a woman filling in a ballot for Ms Harris, before telling her Trump-supporting husband that she made the ‚Äúright choice‚Äù.

‚ÄúIn the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want,‚Äù Roberts narrates. ‚ÄúAnd no one will ever know.‚Äù

Jesse Watters, a Fox News host, said in response that if he found out his wife had lied to him about voting for Ms Harris it would be ‚Äúthe same thing as having an affair‚Äù.

‚ÄúThat violates the sanctity of our marriage,‚Äù said Watters, whose first marriage fell apart when he had an affair with Emma DiGiovine, whom he later married. ‚ÄúWhat else is she keeping from me? What is she lying about?‚Äù

> A week earlier, a comedian who spoke at a New York rally in support of Vance and former president Donald J. Trump&#039;s campaign sparked a furor by calling Puerto Rico a &quot;Floating island of garbage.&quot; In a garbled retort on Tuesday, President Biden criticized Trump and said, &quot;The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.""

"The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.

This paper examines Donald Trump‚Äôs character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America‚Äôs most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington‚Äôs humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln‚Äôs moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump‚Äôs conduct‚Äîboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6th‚Äîreveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump‚Äôs character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.

So I know just about as much as RFK Jr about it. RFK just reads articles and makes these crackpot conspiracy theories about the very bad chemicals in our food, many of which are PROVEN to be effective and helpful in preserving food quality and flavor! I swear people get so worked up over the most minor shit in ingredient lists.

He is not a scientist! He's just a wackjob conspiracy theorist. Maybe if science backed up his claims I'd be more receptive. But for me honestly I try to be open minded, I was intrigued by his third party run, but at the end of the day the guy's beliefs are extremely dangerous to this country. Especially his thoughts on ANYTHING health related. Including chemicals in our food. 

Do a little research and you'll see how harmless this is. It's all just fearmongering. Not every chemical is out to kill you.

Seed Oils BTW are perfectly fine. Do we have proof that they are harmful? And if they are harmful, why are they continued to be used?

"While I agree most people do blow it way out of proportion, there‚Äôs absolutely research showing certain chemicals like dyes in our food are harmful. Just because something is naturally occurring, doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be harmful. Many preservatives aren‚Äôt exactly good for us either. But in the case of preservatives, the potential harm is outweighed by the benefit, as being able to store it safely longer means less food borne illnesses. I think there‚Äôs definitely room for conversation on why we use certain ingredients, and weighing pros and cons. RFK jr is a total nut job though and should be nowhere near that process.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"First of all, I agree with you that our food is to largely blame but I don't think it's as simple as eating too much and not moving enough although we do lead largely sedentary lifestyles. The problem is that all fats are not created equally. Lipid peroxidation is the issue, highly volatile oils like these seed oils are much more easily oxidized than saturated fats like animal fat or butter. The oxidization of polyunsaturated fats creates toxic chemicals like 4HNE (4-hydroxynonenal), our bodies aren't designed to metabolize these fats, it causes all sorts of issues like our bodies don't recognize them to tell us that we've eaten enough.  This leads to the broader issue of ultraprocessed foods which are designed so that we eat more of them, they're full of these oils as well. It's a really deep issue and if you're truly interested I recommend Paul Saladino as he's done voluminous content on these oils. I don't necessarily agree with him on every single thing but overall these oils are a massive issue and we shouldn't be allowing them in our foods let alone subsidizing them such as we do.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"My concern is if we get rid of our preservatives, 1) it'd make my life much more difficult as I cannot cook and rely heavily on processed food to sustain myself and 2) even if I did ""learn to cook"" buying everything organic because dumbass RFK jr made chemicals that extended food shelf life / gave food rosy color illegal would literally bankrupt me",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"You may be ahead of us and 99% of people on this, but that‚Äôs the very reason I‚Äôm skeptical of seed-oil claims, it‚Äôs a very small vocal minority of people who are particularly fixated on them. I really only see random people and influencers on the internet talk about seed oils never mainstream nutritionists. What do you know that the majority of nutritionists apparently don‚Äôt? 

I will freely admit that I don‚Äôt know/understand the issue and even if I researched it (which I have tried to do) I don‚Äôt know enough about basic biology and chemistry to really independently understand the arguments that seed oil detractors make. So the best I can do is rely on the general medical/scientific consensus which has never been that seed oils are good for you but they don‚Äôt necessarily seem to see them as this unique major source of so many problems compared to other fats. 

Nutrition in general appears to be one of those topics that is not only not well understood by the public, but also experts as the prevailing wisdom seems to change all the time.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
Could you link to me your best evidence to support why seed oils are bad?,2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Sorry I think you misunderstood what I‚Äôm trying to say. Things like preservatives are too important to ban, and the very few potential health risks associated with some are easily outweighed by the benefits (food safety). I meant more so the realm of dyes. Plenty of dyes we use have been shown to increase the risk of developing certain cancers, and can be easily replaced or omitted in many foods. Most we only still use because of cost or ease of production.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"First of all, as far as nutritionists and dieticians go, you need to look at the schools that educate these people. Almost the entirety of dietetics is run by Seventh Day Adventists, they are a religious group that believes that vegetarianism is necessary to go to heaven, this is dogmatic, it's not based on science, they start from that claim and work backwards so this is a MAJOR reason why public health officials are so confused and why almost everyone dismisses the claims that seed oils are bad for your health, I believe this is completely overlooked by the majority of people looking into these claims. 

Secondly, large agricultural businesses support these claims, they produce corn and soy on massive scales and it's in their interest to have these oils deemed heart healthy. The American Heart Association was essentially bribed to say that these foods are healthy, almost all of these claims boil down to money and religious views.

There's a lot to it, way more than I can get into now and yes it sounds conspiratorial and in many ways it is but it's more about money and religious views, I don't think most of the people involved think they're doing anything nefarious but I do think people that are saying Cheerios are healthier than beef are out of their goddamn minds.

As I mentioned in another comment, I recommend following Paul Saladino, he's been digging into this for years and I find him to be reputable and not dogmatic. He originally began his dive into health and wellness as a vegan working in cardiology and had serious health conditions that ultimately turned out to be wholly from his vegan diet.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"If you want a deep dive you need to go to Paul Saladino's work, he gets into every aspect of this and is a reputable figure. There are many other people that are hopping on this train but I don't think they're doing it in good faith, they're doing it to build their personal brands and to get followers. 

I think one of the major reasons these oils are so bad is that our bodies do not recognize them in our satiety signaling, we simply never feel like we've eaten enough if that's the food you're eating, you can gorge yourself on thousands of calories of ultra-processed foods and never feel full, try doing that with something like beef fat or butter, it's simply impossible.

There's also the toxicity of the metabolites like 4HNE that I mentioned before, it's poison, this isn't hyperbole, it's literally toxic and that's what is created when you heat these oils such as frying in them.

Lastly, just look at the correlation between obesity and the use of these polyunsaturated fats, it's impossible to believe that it's not the primary cause of the obesity crisis.

Anyway, there's a lot to it, I've been looking into this for years and while I'm just a regular person I think if you take the time to look into it as well you'll see what I see, this is something we need to cut out of our food every chance we can get.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

This orange clown held rallies just as an ego boost while he was a sitting President. It's a wonder how even the staunchest of his sycophants can feign enthusiasm at this point.¬†,2024_11_05,05_45_33
"To be fair, his rallies were attended by grifters with merchandise to off load , they realized a couple weeks ago that the gig is up and their all gone home to burn their merchandise in an accidental fire for the insurance",2024_11_05,05_45_33
Why would they visit him? They already voted! /s,2024_11_05,05_45_33
You know a scene of this happening is going to be in his biopic one day,2024_11_05,05_45_33

My in laws live in State College PA and there are a bunch of folks there that show up the morning of football games to tailgate and sing the fight song them go home when the game starts and maybe check the score the next morning if at all.  That's what Trump's crowds are now.,2024_11_05,05_45_33
"He must not be venmo'ing the ad respondents anymore. Once that cash clears, proof, they disappear from his rallies.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
I don't think I've ever seen a candidate lose enthusiasm the closer election day approaches. Maybe Romney? I don't feel like many GOP voters were particularly enthused by Romney as the candidate from the start.,2024_11_05,05_45_33

"I'm thinking his cult has collapsed after he's abused them every single rally by arriving late 1-2 hours, picking only cheap shitty venues, no water available, boring them shitless with his delusions and dumping them after the rally in the rain, snow or heat because he's too cheap to pay for buses.

Eventually abuse victims wake up. Though they rarely take the next important step of understanding that they too participated in the abuse of others.

According to Chris Christie, during the 2016 election when Trump learned that campaign funds were being spent on a transition team ***in the event that he won***, a furious Trump yelled at Christie, ""You‚Äòre stealing my money! You‚Äôre stealing my fucking money! What the fuck is this??""

Trump then saw Steve Bannon and began screaming at him. ""Why are you letting him steal my fucking money?!""

When Bannon and Christie attempted to explain to Trump that federal law required this money be spent Trump yelled,¬†""Fuck the law! I don't give a fuck about the law! I want my fucking money!""

Bannon and Christie tried to explain that Trump *couldn't* have his money *and* a transition.

Trump yelled, ""Shut it down! Shut down the transition!""",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"Montanan here. We've had an influx of MAGA move here to live out their Yellowstone fantasies, which accelerated during the pandemic. 

These are the kind of people who don't know Montana or Tester nor care about the fact that he is a very Montana centric Senator who has championed a lot of issues that have been popular here (Veterans, Farms, Guns), they just care that he has a (D) next to his name. It's a sad reality for my State.

With that being said there is hope, our Native American tribes have been mobilizing to vote this year after years of policies that have stacked against them, our two major universities are very Liberal and our college kids are motivated, and abortion rights are on the ballet (which is very popular) here so I'm hoping for a boost for Tester who is obviously for Women's rights.


Usually the fact that Sheehy is basically an out of State GOP plant would sink him but a high percentage of voters now are transplants from out of State so it doesn't matter as much as even 10 years ago.



I voted by mail and checked my ballot to make sure it was accepted, and got my Reagan Republican parents to vote for Harris and Blue issues down-ballot for the first time in ages, so doing my best to fight the good fight in Montana.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"It's a shame. Eastern Montana -- you know, the part of that state with old-school ranching communities and history --- I see a ton of support for Tester. Sure theres some sheehy signs, but it's very apparent that Tester has done good work for the folks here, and they recognize it.  
 
But then I drive west into the mountains, and the sheehy support goes through the roof. 
 
I think it's the surge of Republicans that left blue states during covid for a ""perceived freedom"" or something, thinking that Montana fit some sort of ideal that they created while they watched Kevin Costner cos play as a ""cowboy."" 
 
So the rich part of the state is flooded with new residents that all moved here because it's perceived as a ""red"" state, while the eastern half of the state, relatively untouched and whose population has been here for a long time, hasn't been blind to what Tester has done for us. 
 
I want Tester to do well, but I feel like the western half of the state is so flooded with transplants that Sheehy might get it. Let's hope I'm wrong.

"Kamala Harris has been forced to move her penultimate election campaign rally after the¬†[Secret Service](http://v/)¬†declared the site ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù.

The vice-president was due to hold a major rally on the eve of the election at Point State Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, alongside the singer Katy Perry.

The Harris campaign has moved the rally, which will begin around 5pm EST on Monday to the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh following concerns raised by the Secret Service.

It is unclear why agents designated the site ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù, but it comes amid a series of¬†[assassination attempts against Donald Trump](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/09/16/donald-trump-victim-of-second-assassination-attempt-after-s/), Ms Harris‚Äô Republican rival.

After the Pittsburgh event, Ms Harris is expected to travel across the state to attend another rally in Philadelphia.

In July, Trump was¬†[grazed by a bullet](http://v/)¬†when a 20-year-old gunman shot at him while he addressed a crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania.

Two months later, the former president‚Äôs security detail i[ntercepted a man](http://v/)¬†who had allegedly spent 12 hours lying in wait for him at a golf course in Florida with an assault rifle.

On Sunday,¬†[Trump spoke at a rally in Lititz](http://v/), Pennsylvania from behind bulletproof glass ‚Äì a feature of his outdoor rallies since the first attempt on his life.

He joked that any assassin would have to shoot through the rows of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù reporters to hit him, adding: ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt mind that much.‚Äù

Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign‚Äôs communications director, attempted to clarify the comments soon afterwards.

‚ÄúPresident Trump was stating that the media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,‚Äù he said in a statement.

‚ÄúThere can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own.‚Äù

Both candidates are setting a furious pace through[¬†the swing states](http://v/)¬†with just days to go before polling day.

Ms Harris delivered a speech at a church in Detroit, Michigan around noon, followed by campaign stops in the city, and was scheduled to hold a rally in East Lansing on Sunday evening.

After his rally in Lititz, Trump was expected to speak at rallies in Kinston, North Carolina and Macon, Georgia.

"At least it's relevant to the article unlike some news pieces. 

Trump was the target of 2 gunmen, one of which got a shot off. So it makes sense to mention that in an article about a candidate making moves for safety reasons. 

He also won't stop riling up the violent whackjobs who support him with veiled and open threats against anyone he doesn't like. So that's definitely relevant (almost certainly the cause)",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"Call it hopium but I absolutely refuse to believe that all this enthusiasm is coming from people who are enraged that egg prices went up two years ago.

I don't expect Harris to win Kentucky (though who the hell knows anymore), but this cannot be people who were meh on Trump in 2016 and 2020 but decided that this was the year he really won them over.

"I'm a Northern KY resident. There's more enthusiasm for Harris on average that I sense above the same for Trump. You'll still see Trump signs in some people's front lawns, but less on average. Pro Harris signers don't ever get harassed that I've heard of. Only the really, really ignorant & rightfully ostracized are still pulling for Trump, & the rest of many Republicans have taken notice because they are done stooping from one low to the next. The rest are religious nutjobs lamenting why young people don't come to church anymore.

Even if Trump takes KY, we all know he's fucked, & only most of us will say it.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"I can't stress enough that a lot of Republicans here are likely lying about voting for Trump as usual. Many are likely to secretly put country over party here to vote for Harris. Most of us oppose the school voucher amendment proposal. The voting rights proposal is recognized & racist, redundant language even by longtime Republicans. Young people are making their voices heard more than than four years ago.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

I‚Äôll use my state as an example. In terms of enthusiasm is night and day. In 2016/2020 Trump support was high anywhere you went there was signs stickers people wearing MAGA this year nothing. I‚Äôve seen a combined 7 Trump signs as oppose to Harris who is everywhere. Not saying she gonna win TX but something is different this year,2024_11_05,05_45_33

"I voted for Harris in Kentucky on Friday, there were a lot of women around me who were there to vote for her to. There were also many first time voters. I‚Äôve also seen more signs for Harris which is crazy because previously it was a sea of trump signs. We vote for Andy here and I think Kamala is similar to him and that is bringing more centrist voters to her.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Same here. I voted here in Indiana last Friday during off peak hours, and there was actually a line! My district has been pretty solidly red for some time, but the polling station I go to is usually a ghost town during early voting. It definitely gave me a hit of the ol' hopium.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"I'm huffing that hopium too. I've seen countless anecdotal stories all over the internet the last few days of people voting for the first time, people's conservative friends and family members who previously voted for Trump twice switching to Harris, people who have never voted for a Democrat before coming out and proudly saying they voted for Harris. I was at Kamala's closing speech in DC and she brought up a couple who were lifelong Republicans and never voted for a Democrat before to talk about how they're voting for Harris because they like democracy more than their political party. 

My mom, who has always been center-left and preferred Democrats but typically didn't care much for politics, is extremely fired up about Harris because of the abortion bans. It's just been crazy good vibes on the left ever since Harris launched her campaign and I see so many people genuinely excited to vote for her, which I did not see in 2020 and Biden was able to win handily.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"I live in Kentucky, and I know quite a few people who don‚Äôt typically vote but are voting or have already voted this year.

There‚Äôs a school choice state amendment on the ballot it in Kentucky that‚Äôs been super divisive. If it passes, the people would be able to get a voucher to use public dollars intended for public school to pay for private school tuition instead. That‚Äôs a big part of what is bringing people out to vote this year.

Most of those new voters I know are voting for Kamala. I live in the northernmost city in Kentucky though, like I can walk across a bridge and be in downtown Cincinnati in 25 minutes. So my city is not necessarily reflective of the rest of the state",2024_11_05,05_45_33

"It's not that ""egg prices went up two years ago,"" it's that rent and grocery went up for the past four years and people *still* can't afford basics because wages didn't keep pace with inflation.

I met a very nice woman who was conflicted about who to vote for. She hated Trump, but was driving Lyft as a side gig because her salary no longer covered her bills. 

People are desperate and confused. They don't know who to believe or who will fix their problem, because as we all know, politicians make promises they don't keep.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
Trump got attention in the Republican Party because he hated the Black President. He won in 2016 because they hated the woman candidate. Now he‚Äôs running against a Black Woman. That could be motivating for his base.,2024_11_05,05_45_33
"I heard a couple of pundits today say KY may be in play after the surprise poll from Iowa.  I doubt it will happen, but I can say that in my rural little corner of the state, where Trump has reigned supreme for 9 years, its a ratio of 2:1 for Harris signs over Trump.  Totally anecdotal and non-scientific, but it‚Äôs a nice shot of hopium.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

High turnout just the reality we live in ever hyper partisan politics. It‚Äôs unfortunate that the vitriol and social media algorithms lead us to higher participation in the democratic process. Would have been great had we arrived here without that baggage.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

It's still rare here and only really an issue from outside lobbyists. The adds a just stupid, even to reps. Even then, KY is gonna goto Trump. Sadly.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

He is literally the pied piper, leading working Americans to the river to drown them, at the behest of the billionaire class.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Racism and religion are the two major factors. More complicated answer is that Trump tries to make people believe that all their problems are caused by other forces that Trump can allegedly control (like illegal immigration, mainly, and government agencies.) All you have to do to captivate people is have a scapegoat for common person problems. 

Obviously it‚Äôs much more complicated than that, and Trump can‚Äôt really solve any of these problems. However, it‚Äôs also a sunk cost at this point for a lot of people. They‚Äôre too prideful to back out now.

It‚Äôs a complicated issue with a lot of nuance. I‚Äôm surprised someone from Europe cannot understand. Look at how the far right and nationalists are making huge gains in various countries. And the rise of Hitler in Germany in the 30s? It‚Äôs the exact same thing.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

That was also eight years ago.

Whatever happens tomorrow, we can't really use 2016 as a reference anymore. Different circumstances, different Dem candidate, older and more divisive Trump, different demographics. This is not 2016.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Look I know this is not that bad, but Clinton had anything but large crowd sizes in 2016. Especially compared to Trump that year. I had Friends go to her ""rally"" in Chicago a few weeks before the election and got a picture with her without issue or waiting a long time. It was essentially a conference room at a hotel and they just walked right up for the pic. **maybe** a few thousand people. Clinton did not have large rally crowds at all. Granted, Biden didn't in 2020 but we were dealing with a pandemic and I think rally sizes are a dumb metric to begin with. I may vote for a candidate, but I have no desire to go to a rally.

">Also a lot more republicans voted early / by mail this year.

At least as of this morning, they've had a 6% drop in early voting compared to 2020. Democrats have had a 58% drop.

You're right that it is likely because Democrats more openly embraced voting by mail in 2020 and are now just reverting back to in-person voting. Hopefully enough are able to vote tomorrow to make up that difference.",2024_11_05,05_45_33

Except in PA the numbers do support what I'm saying. Right now Democrats are sitting at about 1 million early votes and while that's a 50% lead compared to GOP early votes, it's almost a **60%** drop in early votes compared to 2020. Biden got 3.45 million votes in 2020, so to reach that same number, Democrats need to get about 2.4 million election-day votes tomorrow.

And considering that the 2020 election-day vote (in PA) split 80-40 for Trump, tomorrow could make the result *very* close.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
Remember when she accepted and bragged about the endorsement from the top NeoCon Dick Cheney?,2024_11_05,05_45_33
"Democrats lead early voting 2:1 and it‚Äôs not COVID anymore so yeah there will be more in person turnout, but there could be less enthusiasm on the GOP side as well due to Trump‚Äôs lower favorability. You also need to account for Republicans going Harris, which may be a lot higher than Republicans who went for Biden. Plus Independents, etc. You are literally doing nothing but throwing numbers as if 2020 and 2024 exist in a bubble, and everyone only votes on party lines.",2024_11_05,05_45_33
