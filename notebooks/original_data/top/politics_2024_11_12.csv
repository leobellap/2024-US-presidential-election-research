"Agenda 47 also outlined this. This is one of the policies of Trumps I was hammering for a while, since Agenda 47 and Project 2025 was a bad fucking combo for colleges across the nation.

Per Agenda 47 Trump wanted to get rid of the accreditation boards across the US. If you don't know. These are various boards across the region that certify schools. Once accredited, they can receive Title IV funding AKA Student loans.

Trump wanted to disband all current accreditation boards and install MAGA friendly boards. Those boards will force colleges to get rid of any inclusive programs, any sort of fairness to the application processes, etc. Once the colleges do this, they can get accreditation back. 

The problem that the low information people don't see is that during this window, legally the schools cannot take or process student loans without being accredited. So in essence the schools would have to shut down while they don't have accreditation as if a student passes college while they don't have that, the degree is also no longer from an accredited school and is literally a worthless piece of paper.

This also means all these colleges during that window have to operate and keep the doors open/teachers paid by whatever left over funding they have. If this does not bankrupt the colleges during this, Trump had another plan in mind.

Agenda 47 also outlined a ""America school"" or whatever term he called it. Essentially wanted to create a trade school or something (his lack of wording and word salads make it impossible to determine what is being taught there), but the telling part was he claimed it would give a ""Bachelor-like degree"" that he will force businesses across the nation to recognize it as such. He stated that this would cost no money to attend and completely free. Again absolutely failing to state how 50 states worth of Students can attend this ""school"", no mentions of how many schools he planned on making or anything. The concerning part is he planned on paying for this school purely out of suing every college in America under the guise that white people got rejected in order to enroll a PoC instead. He stated in Agenda 47 he would go after Harvard and yale and sue for their endowments to fund his trade-school BS.

What fell under the radar in 2016-2020 was when Trump and Devos allowed a Mega Church to buy a portfolio of for profit colleges that the bankrupted and stole federal tax dollars from the students with. Biden forgiven the debt those students got this year, because they got a degree they never completed, but were expected to pay back 100% of the loans they took out.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

And (lots of ""ands"") Trump has already called for a federal death penalty for drug dealers (November, 2022, which is on C-SPAN, but other times, too), and porn is as addictive as heroin, so we can expand the death penalty to porn producers and extradite them and whatever, it's a circle jerk of everything with these people.

They'll have to apply the death penalty to porn producers simply on account of the property of identity. They just have to say porn is an illicit drug, which they basically have (but not explicitly) in that quote, and use that as a premise. Let X be an (addictive) illicit drug and Y be pornography (any kind of porn). Then X = Y and X entails the death penalty, so Y also entails the death penalty.

The group suggests criminal penalties should also include hosting or maintaining a website that ‚Äúencourages or facilitates efforts to obtain an illegal abortion,‚Äù offering or providing ‚Äúabortion doula‚Äù services and making referrals to an abortion provider.

> The group recommends states allow civil action to be brought by state or local officials or relatives of the pregnant woman against a person or entity that violates the abortion law.

">  ""Contempt for the con-man, compassion for the conned"".
> 
> It's obviously a difficult thing to apply, but it's worth thinking about.

To an extent, you're absolutely right, but you're missing a huge factor in this plea 

2016 voters, sure, we can argue that compassion for the conned is a good idea. They got sold a bill of goods by one of the great con men of our time, no one really knew what was coming (though a lot of people were pointing out red flags in advance). But the key factor that the plea for compassion misses is remorse. 

If you tell me ""I voted Trump in 2016 because I believed the liberals were overreacting and the news was biased, but I was wrong""  then I can find some compassion for you. We may not be friends, but I can understand that you got duped. It happens, being lied to does not make you a terrible person.

But it's 2024. Not only have Trump voters had the first term to open their eyes, they've also had eight years of news to show them  who Trump is and what his politics are for the country.

Voters in 2024 cannot say ""I didn't know he would commit human rights abuses at the border."" They cannot say ""I didn't know he would incite hatred and violence towards the LGBT community."" They cannot say ""I didn't know he would direct federal agents to murder an activist and brag about it on national TV."" They cannot say ""I didn't know he would direct federal agents to black bag people off the street and drag them away in unmarked minivans."" They cannot say ""I didn't know he wanted to defund FEMA and NOAA in the face of climate change.""

EVEN IF we accept that these voters in 2024 believed Trump when he said he was a victim of lawfare and biased media, they believed him when he said a lot of other things too. They didn't see any of that as a red line.

If someone voted Trump in 2024, I cannot accept that they are simply victims of a conman this go round.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Actually what we know is blue is actually red and red is actually blue. The colors were switched during the Great EnLIEtenment to prove that people would believe anything. The truth is the colors were set by Jesus. When his blood spilled it was actually blue (which is what we now know as red) and that‚Äôs why people say that blood is blue in the body. It‚Äôs blue outside the body too! But the liberal Jews killed Jesus (true) but they wanted people to doubt him so they portrayed him as a liar with red(blue) blood! We need to switch the colors back to their original definitions now! Which means the Democrats are red (the colors of evil) and Republicans are blue (the color of Jesus). The colors switch was a giant liberal trick. And you know because it rhymes. What other colors are the liberals hiding!?,2024_11_12,04_33_33

Project 2025 might be their most aggressive strategy yet, and I'm not downplaying what's in it, but just understand that Heritage Foundation has been around for decades pushing the most heavily conservative policies you can imagine. Every conservative president seems to adopt about 60-70% of them and throws out the most extreme.

That's likely to happen in Trump's term. He hates governing and is happy to let someone else decide policy for him. But he also hates bad press, down economies, and anything that hurts his ego, and he's likely to reject anything that's widely unpopular, which many of the policies in Project 2025 are unpopular even among Republicans.

So this public microscope on Project 2025 is ironic considering this is how it's been for decades without anyone paying attention. I'm glad people are paying attention now and voicing their concern against extreme conservative policies, but it's always been like this and will continue to be like this.

Side note, any time anyone says this, please remember to point out that the idiom is ""one bad apple **spoils the bunch.**""

When apologists refer to dangerously violent power-tripping cops as ""bad apples"", they are literally stating that those cops are actively corrupting every other cop and making the entire precinct more like them.

In fact, the one thing ""bad apple"" **does not mean** is ""an isolated bad actor without influence who can be dismissed as an outlier"", which appears to be how that idiom is most commonly used.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

The prisons have contracts with the employers, and with the prisoners. Abiding by the contracts is tied to the prisoners‚Äô possible early release and their parole. Any deviation from their schedule, like coming in late, or trying to call out sick, voids the contract and withdraws them from the program which promised them early release or parole.

"Long rant, but...

In the 1970's, I moved to an area where there was a local chicken ""factory"".  The factory was simply a few slaughtering plants, rendering plants, feed plants, and in the surrounding area, chicken houses.  These chicken houses were owned by chicken farmers, and they were paid by the chicken company to raise the birds.  

Around 1978, the chicken producer was having trouble finding workers to work in the plants.  The plants were staffed with mostly black workers, the white force left in the 50's for better jobs.  The same thing was being repeated in the 1970's with the black workers leaving and finding better jobs.

The chicken producer/company then went to the state capitol and actuality handed out cash to the legislature as ""gifts"" (was in all the papers at the time) and wouldn't you know it, he/they were able to import some workers from Mexico.

The first arrivals were soon followed by undocumented workers as word spread about jobs.  The local people didn't like it.  Old run-down motels became apartment houses with several families living together.  Several trailer parks were put south and west of town to help absorb the new population.  You began hearing made-up stories about these people, accused of all kinds of things.  The pet eating thing is not new folks.   

The raids started after the first couple of years.  Two, maybe three times a year.  They would round up 40-50 people each time and take them back to Mexico.  A week or two later, the workers would be back.  The revolving cost was their burden, and it ate into any savings they had.

As time went on, these people had children.  Those children are U.S. citizens.  Those children grew up and had more children.  Our area started being called ""Little Mexico"".

But something started changing for our area.  The county next to us lost a major industry and has never recovered.  This happened in the 1980's.  Another bordering county was an agriculture-based economy with a great number of dairy's.  Today, 95% of those dairies are gone.  Each county that surrounds us is almost like it was 40 years ago.

Not ours.  In 1975, there was one Mexican restaurant in the city.  Today, I can't count them all, there's so many.  Along with that, from one end to the other of town, there are countless businesses.  All around us is decay and slow growth, but not here.  Why?

I know why.  You still hear people go on about the Latino population in our area, but they're the reason our area is doing so well. 

As far as who they supported in the election, our county was the only one in the area that no one won.  Every county around us was red.  We were grey because the non-voters number was higher than the number of votes that any candidate got.  I've heard from several sources that tensions are high in the Latino community and people are worried.  They've seen it before.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/08/trump-organization-undocumented-workers  

> The Washington Post reports that the Trump Organization currently employs a ‚Äúroving crew of Latin American employees‚Äù to perform masonry and maintenance work at his winery and various golf clubs around the country. For almost two decades, the group has been comprised of workers who came into the US illegally‚Äîthe penalty for which the president seemingly believes should be death‚Äîaccording to two former crew members. Another one, who still works for Trump, told reporters Joshua Partlow and David A. Fahrenthold that remains the case today. President Trump ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want undocumented people in the country,‚Äù said Jorge Castro, an Ecuadorian immigrant without legal status who left the company last spring after nine years. ‚ÄúBut at his properties, he still has them.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a good worker, papers don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù  

And... 

https://time.com/4465744/donald-trump-undocumented-workers/  

> For 36 years, Trump has denied knowingly using undocumented workers to demolish the building that would be replaced with Trump Tower in 1980. After Senator Marco Rubio raised the issue of undocumented Polish workers during a Republican primary debate this year, Trump described himself as removed from the problem. ‚ÄúI hire a contractor. The contractor then hires the subcontractor,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey have people. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt remember, that was so many years ago, 35 years ago.‚Äù
> 
> But thousands of pages of documents from the case, including reams of testimony and sworn depositions reviewed by TIME, tell a different story. Kept for more than a decade in 13 boxes in a federal judiciary storage unit in Missouri, the documents contain testimony that Trump sought out the Polish workers when he saw them on another job, instigated the creation of the company that paid them and negotiated the hours they would work. The papers contain testimony that Trump repeatedly toured the site where the men were working, directly addressed them about pay problems and even promised to pay them himself, which he eventually did.
> 
> The documents show that after things got ugly over unpaid wages, Trump sought Sullivan‚Äôs advice on the workers and their immigration status. At one point, a lawyer for the Poles testified, Trump threatened, through his own lawyer, to call the Immigration and Naturalization Service and have the workers deported. And when the Labor Department launched a probe of the Polish laborers, Trump again called Sullivan for help, asking him to meet the federal investigator at Trump‚Äôs office, according to the documents.

> Dozens of immigrants who did not have legal status worked on the construction and operation of President Trump‚Äôs resort in Bedminster, N.J., according to a new report by The Washington Post.
> 
> At one time, the Post reports that more than 100 workers without legal status were under employment at the resort.
> 
> Sixteen such workers from Costa Rica and other Latin American nations spoke with The Washington Post and claimed they worked previously at the Bedmister resort illegally, while some said that at one time more than 100 workers without legal status who were employed by the organization lived together.

I think the first 90 days is going to be hell. You're going to see the buses. You're going to see the migrants in your home-- not just blue cities, red cities-- Miami, Houston, Charlotte-- like, red states-- Kansas City, St. Louis.

You're going to see kids not in your schools. You're going to know where they're at because they're waiting in a detention cell and they have cell phones. You're going to see it in social media. You're going to see businesses not be able to open up because their workers didn't show up. You're going to see businesses being raided. And it's going to become more intimate.

This isn't going to be about separating a family at the border, that somebody doesn't know that family member. You're talking about separations and movements in your communities where you're going to know the guy-- Bill, Juan, Luis. You're going to know the individuals.

Nadia Reiman  
One of the things ICE would have to work around is which nationalities to deport first-- you know, if you wanted to make the most impact. A lot of countries don't take their own people back. Venezuela, for example, hardly accepts any immigrants back. Brazil only accepts two to four flights of immigrants a month.

Nadia Reiman  
So who are the first people who would be deported, like, in the first hundred days?

Jason Houser  
Haitians and Guatemalans.

Nadia Reiman  
Haitians and Guatemalans?

Jason Houser  
These countries take back the most flights. So I have an ability to remove-- at volume-- individuals. A lot of them have entered through pathways that we've developed, where we've gained biometric, we've gained vetting, and we've--

Nadia Reiman  
Meaning we know where they are.

Jason Houser  
Yeah, we know where they are. We know where they are. They're working, non-criminal. We go out, we find them. We're going to find nationalities that are easily removable. And we're probably going to do it at volume with single adults first, because removing families is more complex. You've got to hold them, detain them, put them in hotels. It's very staff-intensive. So I'm going to target down on single adults and nationalities where I know the country will take them back very, very quickly.

Nadia Reiman  
OK. So Haitians and Guatemalans and then--

Jason Houser  
There's other populations too, but--

Nadia Reiman  
Who's next after those two?

Jason Houser  
Hondurans, right? We talk about Guatemalans, Hondurans, Nicaraguans, the countries where you see daily-- just in the news and the reporting by DHS and Homeland Security-- where are the most removal flights occurring? Those are the countries that accept those flights.

But if I'm in this scenario where I'm the head of ICE for Trump, all the rules of engagement and policies are out the window. Why not load up a few planeloads of Cuban nationals and send them to the Bahamas and just send them to a third party? Why not just-- I could go find a country that says they'll accept three or four planeloads of Cuban nationals, and I'll send them to a third-party country.

Nadia Reiman  
Jason says ICE can focus on getting people in eight major cities with airport hubs-- Philadelphia, DC, Chicago, Houston, Miami, Denver, New York, and LA. Those have access to quick ICE flights to people's home countries. Jason thinks ICE can get people out before they can get to a judge or a lawyer.

And one way to catch a lot of people quickly, especially the ones who snuck in and ICE has no info on, is to bring back worksite enforcement, a.k.a., large-scale raids. The Biden administration stopped doing those.

Nadia Reiman  
Do you think there would be raids, then, in the first 100 days?

Jason Houser  
I think there would be raids within the first three weeks.

Nadia Reiman  
Really?

Jason Houser  
Yeah. Those are not hard to turn on. Like, to operationalize those, those aren't hard.

Nadia Reiman  
Where? Where would they do them?

Jason Houser  
You would go back to where there's big ICE and Customs and Border Protection resources to do enforcement. And you would do them in communities that would show the most cruelty. So there's nothing that would stop a Trump administration from going into the workplace, going into our hospitality sector, going into restaurants or businesses, and arresting individuals at scale.

Nadia Reiman  
Can you walk through what that would look like? What do you think that would look like?

Jason Houser  
Well, I think it would be very easy to focus on industries that have large numbers and high numbers of migrants working within them. What would stop them from going into a meat processing plant in Virginia? Say there's a couple hundred migrants. There's 80 on shift that day. You go in, you know there's one individual there that has a final order of removal, maybe has a nonviolent criminal background.

You go in, you do the raid, you line all the workers up, and you start checking status of each and every one of them, right? Or maybe you just arrest them all, bring them into detention, and then do the checks to see who is removable. There's nothing that could stop ICE, at that point, from just bringing people into custody, detaining them, and then figuring out who is removable at that time.

Nadia Reiman  
Tom Homan has not denied this, by the way. He's said publicly something like this would be necessary. Homan also said he would do national security threats first-- but then raids, sure. Jason says the raids under a 2.0 Trump administration could be more militarized, with SWAT-style teams. That's not how they've been done in the past. He also told me he thinks nothing would stop ICE from going into hospitals or schools or churches. Normally, ICE doesn't do that. But this is just a policy, not a law.

So after doing these raids and trying to get people out quickly, ICE would be left with lots of immigrants that they have to hold until they can get them deported. I wanted to know, where would you hold all these people?

Nadia Reiman  
Would you build tent camps to hold people?

Jason Houser  
If I'm not looking out for the care of the law enforcement officers that are overseeing it or the migrants, yes, you could. When we did all the evacs and ICE had a very big support in the evacuation out of Afghanistan, we brought on soft-sided facilities at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and other places around the country. But again--

Nadia Reiman  
Soft-sided facilities? Is that euphemism for tents?

Jason Houser
Well, yes. They're big, sort of like fair-- like, carnival tents. They're very thick plastic, and they're soft. Yeah. But what I'm saying is, let's say we put a thousand--

Nadia Reiman  
You're like, they're weatherproof. They're weatherproof. But they're tents.

Jason Houser  
Well, they're not just, like, Coleman tents that you would get to go camping. But what I'm saying is-- but the problem here is, those Afghanis were coming to safety. Now, you're saying, I'm going to bring on a soft-side tent to hold people so I can remove them in, like, 90 days.

The idea that they're just going to, like-- OK, I'm going to live in this deplorable conditions and not cause unrest-- that's where it gets very dangerous.

Nadia Reiman  
Dangerous because Jason thinks there would be fights, riots. People would be hurt, possibly even die, he thinks. And just so I'm clear here, yes, he means immigrants, but also officers. Jason's very concerned about the safety of the ICE officers.

Nadia Reiman  
Where else can you hold people you want to deport? Can you house migrants in jails?

Jason Houser  
Yes.

Nadia Reiman  
Could you lower jailing standards to put more people in a cell?

Jason Houser  
Yes. Well, yes, absolutely.

Nadia Reiman  
Right.

Jason Houser  
But yes.

Nadia Reiman  
Like, I'm saying, could you-- our standard before was three people per cell, and now, we're saying it's six.

Jason Houser  
That is policy. It is not law. So yes, of course you could.

Nadia Reiman  
OK. Could you turn places quickly into detention centers or camps? Like, can you change the standards to make it faster?

Jason Houser  
Yes. I could have-- between FEMA and ICE and DHS, we could turn on 25 old warehouses, old department stores in a week.

Nadia Reiman 
Wow, in a week.

Jason Houser  
Well--

Nadia Reiman  
So definitely doable in the first 100 days.

Jason Houser  
--it would just be a cement building with some mats. And then I make sure we have porta-potties, some food. I have a couple docs there in case somebody gets really sick. And then I bring in a couple hundred security guards. I could do that in a week.

Nadia Reiman  
At the end of the 100 days, how many people do you think will be gone?

Jason Houser  
Let's just say this. Let's say all rules are out the-- and I can remove people that aren't removable. Like, I'm going to send them to third-party countries. ICE has 48,000 people in its custody now. ICE has 14 ICE planes that are hardened planes. They hold 135-- 135 souls. I need more of those. But while I'm sending those 48,000, I'm probably going to go out and bring another 50,000 to 100,000 into custody. So if you're talking 30 to 60 days, you could remove 150,000 to 200,000 people.

Nadia Reiman  
So 200,000 people in the first 60 days?

Jason Houser  
Yeah.

Nadia Reiman  
So in the first 100, that puts you at what, how many?

A million people. Of course, Jason's predicting here, assuming there will be no major roadblocks. But the Brennan Center did this thing where they stress tested with experts and government people whether mass deportations could be done, gamed this all out. In their simulations, funding was a big obstacle right away, so their deportation numbers weren't as large as Jason's.

But that was also assuming that the House wouldn't go Republican, which is looking like it will be as I record this. That would make Jason's math of a million people more possible. And when a million people disappear from the country, it's more than just bodies gone. There's ripple effects.

Jason Houser  
One, we'll see massive inflation continue in this country, because we just pulled a million people out of our workforce-- GDP, businesses, small business especially. And then we'll see thousands of people losing their jobs and small businesses closing, et cetera.

Two, law enforcement activity-- federal specifically, and in cities and states where state and local law enforcement is supporting this mass deportation program-- will halt. Halt. Going out and arresting the rapist and murderer in your county will stop while your sheriff is over playing grabass with Homan and these individuals and trying to do some big mass deportation scheme and throwing Grandma back to Cuba. So law enforcement will be chilled.

Three, migrants will go deeper into the shadows. They will do the steps they need to stay in our country, because it's so much better than going back and risking death in another that they will hide even more into the shadows.

Nadia Reiman  
And so those that are left behind, it's like they become ghosts. They might stop showing up to work. Maybe they'll move. You'll notice them missing-- at your local grocery store, your bar, your daycare. And at the same time, your screens will be broadcasting the deportations on TV, on social media, shouting the images of a million who are actually gone. Jason thinks this will be strategic.

Jason Houser  
I think there's going to be lined-up planes, engines-running imagery of mass removals. I think they're going to grab people and intentionally break our policy, like, break the law and throw some people back to their home country. And then when the courts push back, they can be like, see, the courts made us stop. Because then they can go, hey, look at these bureaucratic pencil necks getting in our way. This is the deep state. This is the deep state.

"I hate this. I hate that so many people think Trump is a populist, and cares about the working people. To me it's so obvious that he doesn't but I've been saying the same things since 2016. Democrats need to go strongly progressive and populist. Nearly since the time I could vote I have been dealing with this Trump bullshit and I tried to explain to older white people why it was important we look for someone like Bernie. I heard over and over, I like him but Hillary is more likely to win against Trump. I begged them to see that what people were responding to with Trump (as stupid as it is) was populism but people laughed at young voters for this and wouldn't take them seriously. We need someone who is angry, passionate, real and populist. Again and again it's Hilary, then Biden, then Kamala. Centrists. I voted for all of them because Trump is a disgusting fraud but we can't just keep doing the same thing. Then people seem confused as to why it isn't working again.

It makes me want to cry at how many people keep saying we need to shift right or keep courting white men. We will never out right the actual right wing. If they call us socialists, own that and explain in what ways we are socialist, it's the same as being populist but we don't have to include the racism, sexism and hate. Maybe it's too late now but it seems so obvious to me and our Democratic party won't ever let us try having a truly populist and progressive candidate. 

The big donors and polished centrists are the problem. It doesn't matter what Kamala is actually saying she will do, it's about how it feels. Its about how forcefully you talk about the working class suffering and it's about actual policy change in action. People are not as educated as they need to be but we can't fix that by letting Republicans win.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Tariffs were a winning argument because it was painted as bringing jobs home, protecting jobs that are already here, and punishing China. The reality is none of those things will happen under a tariff plan because cost is _always_ passed to the consumer. Capitalism means anything manufactured here will be priced right beneath whatever is imported to extract every feasible drop of profit. Additionally the push to replace people with robots/AI will only be accelerated because U.S. labor is expensive, whereas overseas labor isn‚Äôt meaning the ROI on automation isn‚Äôt as strong.

The explanation of why some people won and some didn't really is as simple as who had the better marketing appeal or in Trumps case, propaganda.

We've seen for at least eight years now the GOP will lie, cheat, and steal to win, and the dems should have stopped pretending this wasn't the case eight years ago and prepared like crazy. 

Take a page from the MAGA propaganda handbook and start testing some messaging out that the Repubs seem to have mastered. For example, Cletus in nowhere Alabama who makes $40k a year and votes R is NEVER going to have the same policy needs that John Moneybags, the billionaire trust fund baby in Palm Beach does.

"We need more of this.  Need to dig into the gap and understand it.

I suspect it is going to be less about policy and more about messaging and tone.  Trump is a moron, a bully and criminal and a danger to anyone who falls in close enough for him to cast a shadow over, but he is a natural salesman.

We have an education problem in America and it's why a guy who speaks with a 4th grade level of comprehension is the voice of so many.  Sadly we cannot fix education in a term.  It will take a generation and to get that we have to connect to people in a manner that they like.

I hate lying and don't want to match Trump on that front, but talking about geo-politics will miss on all but the policy wonks like me.  Tell them that you will prioritize keeping their sons and daughters out of foreign wars.  Don't talk about free money for start up businesses or tax deductions for children.  Talk about giving businesses opportunities to grow and making sure families have the ability to feed their kids and save for the future.

Trump NEVER gives details in any of his speeches and when pressed always says, ""we have such a program.  The world has never seen a program this great.  People say, with tears in their eyes, 'sir, we can't believe you are able to do all of this for us,"" when they see my plan.  I have it almost ready.  I'll show it in two week.""  Always two weeks.

And we laugh at his idiot speaking style and his mealy mouth words that say nothing and promise less, or point out how little detail there is.  But he is connecting with his base and they are eating it up.

Maybe less policy detail and more benefits tailored to what the audience wants to hear.  Just do more to achieve it than Trump does. He promised the best economy and is about to deliver the worst crash since possibly the Great Depression and his voters bought it.

Of course the media is another problem... Stop engaging with them as much.  Reach out to progressive news providers, social media, etc.  Connect where the people are consuming information (or misinformation).  The media pushed Harris on policy specifics and let Trump roll with ""good shit, really good shit. The best shit.  Shit no on will believe."" and then they smile and thank him.

In military terms, elections have become asynchronous warfare.  If we prepare for older forms of combat we will be overwhelmed... which is what happened this year.

I pray we have another opportunity to get it right (actually left... I have a problem with all things right, these days).

Edit:  The one place we should not match his messaging is the scape-goating.  It's been the Republican way for decades... Blame some other group for their groups failure to achieve and focus their bases anger that way.  The left doesn't really have a parallel not should it.  That's one rhetoric device we should not use, but need a way to counter for our good and the good of the groups the right demonizes.  As unnatural as it is we might do more to help by talking about it less.

And I know Harris didn't focus primarily on ""woke"" issues, Trump did, but he accused the left of making the race about it and the left naturally wants to defend those people and deny that ends up talking about it, giving the right more media bites on how ""Crazy Cackling Kamala"" just goes on an on about those ""woke folks"".  Maybe, not taking the bait is better.  Maybe just respond with America is for all Americans and a promise to those who aspire to be Americans and we will protect every American aggressively.  I don't know.  Something like that.

It is also clearly a failure to point out how awful the other guy is.  He needs called out, but it can't be a campaign plank.  If you are messaging ""Trump will deport you all"" and he is saying ""nah fam, I got you.  It's the other ones we are after,"" and they believe him (never mind his bald Goebbels wannabe is pounding podiums and screaming ""America is for Americans only"" at the top of his lungs and giggling over the use of denaturalization they plan to use to even remove undesirables legal immigrants) then our message sounds false or, at best, suspect.

"That type of split ticket goes to show how policy platforms mean very little to some swing voters. They vote mostly on how voting for someone makes them feel, and they'd rather vote for radical change in any direction than incremental change for the better.

People liked Bernie because he made socialist policies sound like they were making lives better by sticking it to corporations and the 1%. The fears about socialism go out the window when you propose policies that *are* socialist without calling them that. Republicans like social security and Medicare, and the deep red Missouri and Alaska just voted to raise their minimum wages to the same as ""liberal hellscape"" New York.

The winning strategy isn't to dramatically reveal that the policies they like were socialism all along like you're Agatha Harkness revealing your evil plan. It's to own those policies and promise to boost and protect them. Rip the labels off of them, and introduce new policies that are still socialist but are for *everyone*. Don't say it's for the poor, because even the guy living in a shack in the woods is going to think it doesn't apply to him.

Then simply highlight the pushback from Republicans and their corporate masters as proof they're not for the people at all, pivot every accusation of being socialist into wondering why Republicans hate the people so much, all the whole talking about how much of a revolution all this is, and you might now have a winning strategy to becoming the real party of the working class.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"It shows that narrative means more than specific policies

Trump took Sanders narrative and twisted it to his needs, he gave people an enemy, he acknowledged their very real pain and anger about being fucked over since the 70s, 80s and 90s with globalization and offshoring, he gave them a story about being fucked over by ""Elites"" and how the government works for thosee elites and not for them and screws them over for their own gains and how that isnt fair and that he will fight for them.


Sound fucking familiar to anyone? It should, because thats Bernie Sanders and his narrative framework


Forget about the specific policies and how trump isnt going to actually help the working class or poor and that the entire GOP is rabidly anti labor and anti assistance of any kind....ignore all that shit, and focus omehow the message is delivered.

Democrats completely fucked up by pushing Sanders and progressive economic policies aside, a lot of Sanders supporters went to trump, which would be shocking and not make any sense if you focus on policies, but should make perfect sense if you focus on narrative framework.

And it makes sense to me that there are also AOC/Trump voters too tbh, Sanders, AOC, to a lesser degree Elizabeth Warren are the only people with any visibility in the Democratic Party that are similar to trump narrarive wise and have acknowledged the real pain and causes of pain that poor and working class people feel, they have pointed fingers and called out the enemy

Sanders responses to Pelosi should be listened to, its EXACTLY Correct and on point, and IMO if the Democratic party wishes to survive it needs to get on board.

I still think the GOP has a massive fucking problem long term, because there is no fucking way they are actually going to be able to deliver for poor and working class people, the things we/they(im far from working class income wise now but its where im from and the industry im in so thats my group imo) need to finally get ahead are completely antithetical to the republican theory of the case. What they are planning on doing economically and government funding wise is going to really fuck over poor and working class people and its going to cause a lot of pain really quickly, and its going to be the same shit they always do with rate cuts and pouring extraordinary amounts of money into the mouths of the already wealthy in the hopes that trickle down economics finally works this time(it wont) and these massive ill conceived tariffs are going to cause rapid inflation which will be felt on the bottom almost immediately....they are still gettable but the DNC needs to go after their donor class and im not hopeful they will",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"> How do you vote for abortion rights as a concept but yet put in power the very people who will take that right away

It's very simple. It's because Trump openly stated that he believed it was an issue for the states.

Ergo people in conservative states are likely to listen to what a conservative candidate says and act accordingly, in this case by voting for a state-level ballot measure so their state can decide as was recommended by the conservative candidate.

You can have your own opinions on what federal policy will look like in practice, but it's really not that confusing that people in conservative states will freely vote their opinion on a state ballot measure after the conservative candidate directly tells them it's an issue to be decided by the states. Conservative voters don't automatically believe the opposite of whatever Trump says like many liberal voters do, so it shouldn't be surprising when they believe what he said about states being able to make their own decisions for abortion.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Trump winning last time and probably this time is a lot more about rejection of the status quo than anything else, just Trumps voters had an 'outsider' to get up and vote for, while dems did not

2016 was same, while 2020 was more a rejection of trump than support for Biden

On Election Day, there was a spike in Google search results for questions like ‚Äúwho is Kamala Harris‚Äù and ‚ÄúDid Biden drop out‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow to vote for Joe Biden‚Äù and even ‚ÄúKamala Harris policies‚Äù and ‚ÄúDonald Trump policies‚Äù. There are vast swathes of the electorate who are so politically unengaged or uninformed that they didn‚Äôt even realize Biden dropped out months ago or bother doing basic research on candidates until Election Day.

Many voters are also entirely misinformed and vote based on Republican propaganda, whether about Gaza or the economy or any number of issues. Look at the vote spread of people who think there‚Äôs a horde of illegal immigrants streaming into the country even though most of them are immediately deported after CBP encounters or awaiting court hearings, the people who think inflation is at record highs because they don‚Äôt understand inflation isn‚Äôt just their groceries going up, the people who think we‚Äôre giving billions in cash to Ukraine as aid when almost all of it is surplus military equipment, the people who blame Biden for tax raises signed by Trump, etc.

An Ipsos poll from October found that people who think violent crime is at record highs, who don‚Äôt know inflation has dropped to historic averages, who think the stock market is down, who don‚Äôt realize illegal immigration is down, all lean R by overwhelming margins: R+26, R+19, R+9, R+27. People who weren‚Äôt misinformed polled at D+65, D+53, D+20, D+59.

Arab Americans flipped to Trump or refused to vote over Gaza. They‚Äôre complete idiots because Trump will be 100x worse: it‚Äôs a kneejerk emotional reaction without any understanding of the actual consequences or out of a desire for revenge on Biden/Harris.

Same thing with voters at large: try explaining to your average American how Trump‚Äôs economic policies+his disastrous handling of COVID crashed the economy, how Biden and the Fed had to pull the US out and higher inflation is common after quantitative easing, how the US is actually doing pretty well compared to other countries and inflation is down now without a recession, how deflation is actually bad for the economy, etc. and you get blank stares and cries about groceries being cheaper under Trump with zero understanding of basic macroeconomics or monetary policy.

Meanwhile the guy who just got elected is promising tariffs on all imports and higher tariffs on China, which will absolutely ruin the economy that the US has spent the past 4 years finally stabilizing after COVID, but the average American has no idea about his plans or has no idea what tariffs are. See the screenshots going around of Trump voters freaking out once they learn what tariffs are and that they‚Äôll have to pay for it.

I saw an article posted basically arguing that people want more/expanded emergency social programs like 2020/2021 that made their lives better and expired under Biden. The logical answer to being better off with expanded emergency social safety nets in 2020/2021 is to vote for the party promising more social safety nets, not the one that consistently opposes them. Trump will not restore those programs and will actively make life worse for the vast majority of this country.

Trump‚Äôs previous tariffs forced the government to bail out farmers who lost their Chinese market forever: those people went to Brazilian farmers instead, and stayed there even after Trump‚Äôs tariffs were lifted. His steel tariffs led to layoffs and rising prices, same with lumber and other raw materials. The housing price boom is partially because his tariffs made building new houses economically unviable and drove up demand for existing houses.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"**There is a huge overlap of people who donated to Bernie who then went on to donate to Trump.** 



The nation came out with an article recently about how it shouldn't be left or right,

But pro or anti systems+institutions

The American quality of life has been spiraling downwards for decades, long before inflation. Housing, Healthcare, and Education inflation has been bonkers.

It's not the only paradigm to view this loss, there's always multiple factors. But I think it's an important one.

There is surprisingly a lot of carry over between people who donated to Bernie and people who donated to Trump.

Bernie and Trump's rhetoric do share some elements. That shit is rigged, and they're going to tear down something.

Kamala Harris has a very strong impression of being an institutionalist. Someone who would fight for institutions, not tear them down. Of course Kamala was talking about the type of institutions that literally hold our nation together and get rid of criminals. But that nuance was lost. And to be their credit, Kamala is very institutional.

When Kamala was younger, she protested against the death penalty. As CA AG, she fought for it, despite being widely unpopular in CA.

It can't get anymore institutional than that.

Kamala had very little time to campaign. She only had 3 months vs Trump's 4 years. Every second counted. And she spent a whole effing day of that entertaining the VISA CEO at her house, amidst the DOJ bringing an anti-trust lawsuit against them for gouging small businesses with fees.

On domestic issues, I was a fan of Kamala. But even I knew that she was going to work within existing systems, rather than do something bold like what Obama did with healthcare.

And to be honest, Biden did some institutional rawamping himself. Lina Khan. em effing Lina Khan!

If I was in a coma and learned about Biden's accomplishments but told me it was Bernie who won and did them, I would have believed you.

Even though Biden won, he was smart enough to realize it's because of Obama being the de-facto leader of the democratic party and Biden only won due to Obama's involvement. Biden knew that the people really wanted Bernie, and so he did everything he could to implement his domestic agenda.

But he marketed himself in a way not to spook conservative voters, instead of marketing himself to those desperate for change.

But a non-college educated white guy isn't even going to realize this. All they saw was Biden supporting institutions.

Also, i have say that Gaza probably painted the impressions on what Biden and Kamala would do on domestic policy. Though Gaza was not a high priority on the vast majority voters concerns, I can imagine that if Kamala and Joe can't stand up to a ginocide, how are they going to standup for others with no voices? It may explain why 30 polls found that Kamala would have gained 5-6 points in all of the swing states, despite Gaza being a low priority for voters.

In 2028, it'll be Ron DeSantis, who would probably also be seen as an institutionalist as 2x gov of Florida. But so would Gavin Newsome, and for the midwest, Gavin would probably be seen more of the institutionalist.

AOC has very similar messaging to Bernie Sanders. I think she would do well in 2028.Even at her speech at the DNC, she called out that Trump would sell out the country for a dollar. That's the type of messaging that hits these people.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
Same thing people wanted from Bernie. Tear down a lot and build it back better.,2024_11_12,04_33_33
Yes. This is what Dems failed to learn from both 2016 and Biden‚Äôs extremely narrow 2020 victory: people don‚Äôt trust the establishment and want people who they think will fight for them against it.

If we look at past elections, these differences don‚Äôt add up. In 2020 Trump got 2.7 mill votes, and 93k more than the R senate. Biden got 2.6 mill votes, and 115k more votes than the D senate. The total votes are very similar but the senate votes are just so off. How in 2024 have we gone from that to around 350,000 people voting a D senate and Trump on the same ballot?

"Yeah, I think in the past political parties used to need both logic and emotion to make their case to the voting public. Nowadays, emotion overrules everything.

In the past, you had, lets say for the sake of example, 40% of the voting population that paid attention to politics on the regular, but the remaining 60% just showed up last minute and voted with their gut, which is almost a literal coin-flip. So in aggregate, you'd get outcomes for candidates where they swept like 60% of the vote, because they'd pull their half from those emotional coin-flippers for a baseline 30%, but make an excellent case to the informed, for another 30%.

Nowadays, you're talking about 90-ish% of the voting population being driven by emotion, with smaller and smaller numbers of informed voters taking part, so all of these appeals to reason, logic, policy, etc. fall completely flat, and you've now got to raise the odds of getting those emotional voters on your side, and we've seen a lot more political race results coming to 49:51 as compared to the past.

So, from that perspective this whole 'polarization' problem comes down to the fact that there are far fewer informed voters able to swing these races heavily in one direction or another, leaving us with hordes of people who will switch political positions on a dime, based on the latest, most emotionally charged thing they heard about that week.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"The long-term idealistic answer is that we have to completely redefine our societal priorities and build systems that equalize support across all demographics and economic realities to ensure that the entire voting populace is not only educated but also doesn't feel like being engaged and informed is some sort of luxury that only the elite have time and energy for. 

As far as the short term answer, which is critically important if we want to make the longer term version happen, it seems to me that we need to study candidates that people are *actually excited to vote for*. Bernie and AOC created excitement not because of the policies that they proposed, it was because they spoke directly to people in a way that they could relate to. More importantly, they were **angry**, just like much of our country is angry right now, and they managed to use that anger as a piece of their campaign without being hateful. The way to beat MAGA is not to tell people that they're wrong to be angry at the systems around them, or that the ways other people are expressing their anger (even trump) are wrong (even if they are). It's to tell people that they're right to be angry, to talk to them like human beings, and to explain to them why using their anger to influence change around them and building up others is infinitely more productive than trying to tear people down. A rising tide lifts all ships, but if you think your ship is sinking and one person is trying to tell you that everything is fine while the other person is telling you that you're about to die and it's because of that ship right next to you, only one of those people is providing a solution.  
  
I think at the moment, a lot of this boils down to Americans not having healthy coping mechanisms. People don't like what's going on around them and they're pissed about it. The Democratic party needs to find a way to accept that anger, tell people it's ok to be angry, and redirect it towards legitimate progress.

"> 100%. Facts don‚Äôt matter to the average voter, if anything, the average voter is horrifically uninformed or outright misinformed and votes based on vibes over substance

Absolutely. For some reasons, people don't seem to care about truth at all, and don't want to punish politicians for lying. What they want is someone dedicated to solving the issues they care about.

For example, when Trump says immigrants are eating cats and dogs in Springfield, a lot of voters know this isn't true. They don't care.

What the typical voter understands, is that Trump is extremely dedicated to reducing immigration. They conclude that either Trump is incredibly motivated because he (wrongfully) believes immigrants are actually eating pets, or that he is so dedicated that he is willing to make up lies about it.

Either way, the public hear his comments and approve of his commitment.

Democrats then end up constantly repeating what Trump said, effectively spreading his message for him.

Trump has been using this strategy all the way back in 2016, when he first said that illegal immigrants are rapists. Some believed him yes, but many didn't. Regardless, a lot of voters were happy to see someone finally committed to reducing immigration.

What I can't understand is how democrats keep falling in the same traps, for 8 years straight.

Here are my recommendations for democrats:

- Exaggerate the truth. People correcting you just spread your message.
- Don't be afraid to offend the 10% of the other side who will never vote for you anyway. Offended people spread your message.
- Propose bold ideas, even if they have little chance of being implemented. People crave drastic change, and plans always get watered-down before being implemented.
- Don't ever repeat what your opponent said, unless it directly goes against the narrative they are trying to build. You don't want to be their messenger for them.
- Be assertive and dominant. People want a strong masculine leader to force change through.
- Don't insult voters, no matter who they are. You can offend them but don't insult them.
- Take risks. ""Playing it safe"" is the most dangerous thing you can do.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"Yeah I agree. I'm not going to say there's any election fraud, but if there were going to be fraud this election seems like it would somehow be more believable than 2020.

I'm going to preface this by saying I think the election was legit. Hell, even Trump seemed surprised he won, which to me (mistakenly or not, I don't know) reinforces the results to me. He was winding up for court battles and election fraud claims, then he actually just won. I think *everyone* was preparing for two months of litigation hell over the results. Then he just won.

*That being said* to toss on my conspiracy hat briefly. This election seems odd, more so than 2020. In 2020 it made sense that people tossed out Trump - it was a pandemic, we had a bad time, and Biden was different. Record turnout, etc. He barely won, but he won.

But this? This makes very little sense to me. Trump ran the most ridiculous campaign I've seen filled with hatred, bigotry, racism, fear mongering, and lies. For fuck sake, he said people were eating pets in a debate that millions of people watched. At times he wasn't even coherent. And not only did he win, but he won by a lot.

"Unfortunately, I think it takes only one bad interaction with someone from a different background to make people terrified of offending people. I encountered a woman during a spring retreat this year‚Äîan influencer, which I think is relevant‚Äîwho insisted on making a mountain out of a molehill, apparently whenever she got bored. She reduced two separate people to tears after berating them about whatever ‚Äúinsensitive‚Äù thing they said about her ‚Äúcause of the week‚Äù (it happened to be transphobia at the time). How do I know? Because then she went to the cohort‚Äôs group chat and scolded everyone at the retreat for not doing anything about these ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù comments, which were made in front of us (and weren‚Äôt actually offensive).

The kicker? This was a DEI retreat. Everyone gave her the benefit of the doubt from the beginning, but by the second incident we walked away hating her guts.

And this isn‚Äôt anything new. It‚Äôs basically just bullying. But if you see someone get viciously bullied for mouthing off to the wrong person, or owning cheap clothes, or having a crappy haircut, or whatever, you‚Äôre going to make sure you keep your head down, buy nice clothes, and get stylish haircuts‚Äîeven if most of the people you encounter AREN‚ÄôT bullies. But this a space where it‚Äôs really easy for bullies to hide, because when the majority of society wants, for example, trans people gone or dead, trans activists HAVE to be aggressive. There‚Äôs a fine line between standing up for yourself and bullying in actual practice‚Äîat what point is it justified sensitivity versus clear intention/power-tripping?

Aren‚Äôt the tariffs paying for everything?  /s,2024_11_12,04_33_33
"Best thing Trump can do is to just let current policies play out, and claim the credits for those. Impose a few inconsequential tariffs, throw out some illegal immigrants, and launch a PR campaign around those. His voters would eat it right up, and claim declare a huge victory. 

After that he can pretty much retire to the golf course, while other people are packing the courts. 

But I suspect he's so fixated on tariffs that he can't see straight. I figure that with China going to a debt crisis, Trump imagines he can strong-arm China into unfavorable trade deal. If China calls his bluff or injures his ego, he could very well start a full-scale trade war - just for spite. 

Same with immigration. It's one of those policies that he can enact by a pen stroke, without being actively part of it - all the policing will be handled locally. If/when local police won't cooperate with him, he'll feel offended and lash out on those states. 

It's a damn shame that so much of the upcoming Trump policies hinge on his day-to-day mood, and whether or not his ego has been bruised.

As for the no tax on tips, anyone with half a brain immediately understood when first hearing about it, that it was bullshit to get around raising the federal minimum wage to seem like doing something for workers - and to not cost employers a dime. 

The policy couldn't really hurt though, Harris was right to embrace the policy because it means something people who work for tips - as much for the wasted time it takes to calculate that at the end of a shift, as the money itself. And the amount of revenue it generates for government is minuscule. 

Perhaps if the minimum wage was raised to a living wage indexed to inflation, then taxing tips might be less petty, punishing, and humiliating. It was always bullshit.

This has to be one of the most difficult things to explain to people - when money is ""spent"" it goes somewhere.  It's not like The Onion where they debated: ""should the government stop dumping money in a giant hole?""



When money is spent on the military it often goes towards American businesses and American jobs to produce goods that they otherwise would not be producing.  It's not like we can eat missiles and drones but the American workers are now paid from those jobs and spend that money on the American economy.



When money is spent on welfare that money is then spent on groceries, clothes, etc and put right back into the economy supporting local businesses.  That money doesn't just disappear.


When tax cuts are given to the ultra wealthy they keep the money in the stock market which doesn't create more jobs and just inflates the stock market valuation and allows them to scoop more future profits off the top of businesses because..... they already had lots of money to begin with.... and that push for never ending profits squeezes the lower classes or requires inflation to justify valuations (future profits increase if inflation goes up).",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"One thing I remember my professors telling me is that a lot of material that we covered is meant to be covered by high-level academics and those in positions of policy (Public Health). A lot of the material we covered was definitely extremely high-level, and if I talked about it to my group of friends, they would look at me like I grew a second head. It's just that complicated, but it's a language that academics and policymakers understand. 

The issue of that is translating it to be more digestible. The average person will most likely never see it at that high of a level, and if someone says they do, they're either at that level because of where they work or what they study, they're lying through their teeth, or they ended up reiterating what they heard from someone they follow. 

The standard is to take what we studied or work on and make it readable at the 8th grade level since the average American reads at an 8th grade reading level, at the highest. That's what it was for the longest time, but now it's a lot harder, and a lot of people (not just kids, but full grown adults) are having a hard time reading at the 8th grade level. This isn't a jab at them being dumb at all, but with so much media coming out that's just noise at this point, people don't know what to believe/like to listen to something unless they hear something that agrees with their already set viewpoints. The media recognizes this and goes with the flow of what makes the most money.

Academics and those at the policy level are having a harder time translating what they do and study, because they're already translating extremely difficult material to something that is easier to understand for someone who is 12-13 years old. Now, there's been talks of pushing it down even more to a 6th grade reading level, which makes it even harder than what it is now. My friend who's doing his Ph.D says that he knows for sure that what he's studying (Cognitive neuroscience) is something that will be extremely difficult to translate down to the average American.

Also, a few sources for anyone who thinks I'm full of shit about the whole average American reading at most, 8th grade level:

It's not just that the interest rates are higher. The vast majority of global trade is denoted in USD because it's the safest store of wealth in the globe. The Federal Reserve would no longer be able to fund the FDIC or the NCUSIF (the credit union equivalent). This will cause massive bank panics. 

The Federal government would no longer be able to fund at any level beyond the most minimal options. We wouldn't be able to afford to maintain the social programs, park system, regulatory body, or even the US military. 

Ever realize how rarely we hear about cargo ships getting hijacked, confiscated, stolen, blown up, etc.? That's because the US Navy protects the global waters for trade. We'll even put soldiers on those cargo ships or provide escorts to protect them if necessary, even if they're foreign ships coming to and going from foreign ports. We'd no longer be able to do so. 

Global trade is denoted in USD. Why? Because the dollar is backed by the US government and Treasury bills. These are considered the safest store of wealth in the globe. The US has never defaulted, it's a liquid cash equivalent, it's predictable, and it's quite literally used as the definition of ""risk-free return"".

Then also adding that a lot of states no longer had covid rules for mail in voting. So it meant the people whose only option was to vote in person either couldn't or just didn't.

Would those things pass? Probably not, but get caught trying, then you can run on getting a strong enough majority to pass them.

If people are voting in fascism to lower the price of eggs, imagine what happens when you promise to lower rent.  Not through policies and building that result in a gradual decline over decades, but new laws that cut rent 30% overnight.

He ranted about sharks and batteries, he swayed back and forth to Ave Maria, he screamed about Haitians eating pets. But I don't recall a single ad or mailer or talking point (and I live in a swing state, so I was *bombarded* with shit the past two months) that said anything about how to curb inflation, raise worker wages, or otherwise provide economic relief for people who are struggling. His *only* economic promise was to enact tariffs on everything, which *every economist on the planet* has said will only make things *worse*.

So no doubt Harris must overperform to offset the inherent bias, and that's self-evident simply by the fact that people complain abut her laugh while the other guy can drone on about Arnold Palmer's dong, list aimlessly for 40 minutes at a town hall, or be a literal convicted felon.

But I think when it comes down to it, people underestimate just how strong the right wing media disinfo operation is that cuts across social media, youtube, radio, decentralized news, and of course the Fox News, Newsmax, OANN orbit. We of course knew all along that Joe Rogan was an operative for them no differently than Alex Jones. They're just that effective at weaving in day to day life and bringing it back to politics and blaming Democrats.

Let's face it: The median voter has neither the time nor education to parse through what is fact and what is bullshit. They are led astray so easily.

">  I don't imagine our forefathers who fought against having a king would be happy about this.

You clear didn't know our forefathers very well because you've been spoon fed the rosy cheek history we teach in schools.

TLDR: only *some* of the founding fathers were staunch anti-monarchists. Majority were pro-monarchy and even saw King George  III favorably, at least, prior to Revolutionary War starting.

If you pay attention to the pre-war slogans, you'll realize that in the first place, the colonies didn't want to be free from Britain, they wanted a place at the table, namely, parliament. In effect, the core demand was that the new world colonies be given parliamentary seats and be brought more formally into the empire as proper states of it rather than simply ""colonies"". By a certain perspective, the war against Britain was over the actions of *parliament* not necessarily King George III, who (British parliament) were the ones that levied the majority of the unpopular taxes.

By the time that the Revolutionary War ended, the majority of the founding fathers were still pro-monarchy but not pro-British monarchy; and indeed, they tried to seat George Washington as a true king, and if you examine the day one constitution, without the bill of rights or any amendment that have come after, effectively an elective aristocracy backing it. 

It was *Washington* who pressured the rest of the congress, to establish a presidential system instead; and it was many many centuries of work until we fully dismantled the elective aristocracy, work that didn't finish until the early 20th century.

By all accounts: the founding fathers wanted a constitutional monarchy, with an elective aristocracy under a Republic framework (read: the classical kind of Republic, like the Roman Republic). In effect, arguably, day one America was not by any means, a democracy, even with the presidential system that Washington forced the congress to accept.

We arguably didn't become a Democracy in real terms until the 14th amendment basically formally codified and expanded the right to vote to all men of at least 21 years of age. While it was chiefly concerned with safe guarding the rights of former slaves, its secondary benefit was breaking the power of the landed elite (American aristocracy) by basically ensuring non-land owning males also could vote as well more generally (so in effect, a lot of poor white men were also enfranchised by this as well).",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Trump could even speed the end of the war even more by starting to ship weapons to Russia for use against Ukraine. That will bring about a swift end.

I didn't fully understand the Ukraine war and why the US was fighting so hard against it until I realized that this is one of those times that we have learned from the past and I don't think anyone has really done a good job of explaining it. When Hitler started consuming territories at the start of WW2 appeasement was the SOP for many nations and it wasn't until it was practically too late that people started fighting back. In some respects we should want to support Ukraine because to not and allow Russia to expand without resistance could be as catastrophic as not limiting Germany almost a 100 years ago. I do wonder why no one has explained this and instead I had to look for this information on my own.,2024_11_12,04_33_33
"Honestly, this article is a mess from a journalistic perspective. The headline alone ‚Äî ‚ÄòPutin Gives Trump Massive Middle Finger‚Äô ‚Äî screams sensationalism. If you‚Äôre trying to report on geopolitics, maybe skip the WWE promo-level language. It feels more like an opinion piece designed to rile people up than actual reporting.

It also relies heavily on secondary sources (NBC News, Washington Post, etc.) without offering any unique insights or firsthand information. It‚Äôs basically just a regurgitation of other articles, which makes it feel redundant. On top of that, they don‚Äôt even link to the original statements or data, so ‚Äòtrust me bro‚Äô is the real source.

The biggest issue, though, is how one-sided it is. It paints Trump and Putin as cartoonish villains without including any neutral or alternative perspectives. Like, even if you‚Äôre anti-Trump, you should want balanced reporting to actually understand the full picture. Contrast that with something like Politico‚Äôs take on Trump‚Äôs comments about Putin being ‚Äògenius‚Äô ‚Äî they include quotes, context, and leave the editorializing to the readers.

I know many people here despise the whole Republican Party but one thing you gotta give them credit for is that they were smart enough to let the party rebrand itself organically after their defeat in 2012. If you remember back in the primaries in 2016, Trump was a complete outsider to the Republican Party Establishment and if they wanted to have their way, they would have aggressively pushed someone like Marco Rubio or Jen Bush but they didn't.

They were smart and realized the rise of Trump's popularity in 2016 was their ticket to the White House.

I have little faith in the Democratic Establishment allowing a similar outsider to rise up through the primaries.

The principles didn't know Trump's Agenda 47 calls for their jobs to become elected positions. The environmental scientist had no clue project 2025 calls for cuts to the EPA. None of my neighbors had any clue that they supported policies that fucked them over.  

They did, however, all get their news from social media. So they all ""knew"" all about Kamala recently turning black, how she slept her way to winning multiple state wide elections in CA. They all ""knew"" that our NATO allies would never respect a woman running a NATO country. They all ""knew"" she was running with no policies.  

It's was like watching an episode of star trek. Each one repeating the same talking points like a borg robot. Some of these people didn't even know each other.  They just all follow the same tiktok/insta/fb accounts.  

These people are convinced that Kamala is deep into the Hollywood Pedo Machine, so they voted for the literal rapist who owned kids beauty pageants and was friends with Epstein and Diddy.

There is truth to both of these things.  The Republican base is way more reliable and understands how to play the voter outreach game.  Democrats have a messaging problem, at least in part because their core supporters are constantly sabotaging them, or making them jump through rhetorical hoops for what ends up being halfhearted support.  Doing this song and dance to keep the base united confuses moderates at best, and turns them off at worst.

> ‚ÄúI am not committed to naming any (of the potential candidates), but the people I‚Äôve named, and among them there are four Black women,‚Äù Biden told MSNBC‚Äôs Joy Reid on ‚ÄúThe ReidOut.‚Äù 

Biden repeatedly indicated that the primary qualifying features in his choices for VP were that they were women, and specifically Black women. 

This is what frustrates people about Democrat identity politics. While Harris is of course qualified on her own merit, she was put in an untenable position by this messaging that she herself attained her position by dint of identity politics.

I would settle for a soft landing with a boot on the necks of corporations jacking up prices.,2024_11_12,04_33_33
The President can‚Äôt make eggs cheaper. That was corporate greed. Progressive policies do address these issues and they are not focused just on giving free stuff. Americans claim they are suffering financially and they elected the guy that claims if the US stock market is in record territory then Americans are thriving and the economy is strong. Test the economy and Americans aren‚Äôt the stock market which is at an all time record high this election.,2024_11_12,04_33_33
"They did target inflation. Inflation is not the same as high prices. Inflation is how fast prices are rising. Lowering inflation doesn't bring prices down. It just stops them from going up more.

Put another way, it prevents more harm from happening, but it doesn't reverse the harm that already occured.

Lowering prices is tricky, because in general, you want to avoid deflation in an economy, since that's a fantastic way to trigger a recession.

Because of this, the best cure to inflation is to raise wages in line with inflation - but doing that is problematic if companies want to squeeze out more profit rather than pay workers enough. By which I mean companies simply won't do this if there is any other way to get the workers they need, or go without those workers if possible.

Raising minimum wage is one of the better ways to do this, but Congress has been far too gridlocked to get that done. Mostly, you can thank Manchin and Sinema for that last admin (as well as the entire Republican party of course). And you sure as shit won't see Republicans pass an increase this term.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"There‚Äôs a lot of things that go into inflation. Unemployment rates being a key one. The plan was to keep unemployment low while also slowing inflation. Biden could only affect unemployment in that pair, the fed manages the other. Beat Biden could do was follow the fed to mitigate the pain for the middle class. Which he did remarkably well imo",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"Biden did do this‚Ä¶ well more specifically he did what he could since inflation is the responsibility of the federal reserve and not really the president. All Biden could do was reappoint Jerome Powell to fix the problem without crashing the economy and he largely did.

You are in for a rude awakening. Obamacare was popular in theory too. And Afghanistan withdrawal. And mass deportations.

If the answer is yes to any of those, republicans can wedge off more than enough people.

In all honesty people who voted for trump are idiots given they know how it went last time and still to do a retry of it.

The economy pre-COVID was strong and saying it wasn't is disingenuous. You know that as well as I do. 

People didn't vote for Trump because he's going to fix the economy. They voted for Trump because it's been an awful 4 years for middle and lower middle class Americans who struggle to even afford groceries in 2024 and the thought of 4 more years of it would break them. Then their pleas about how their pocketbooks were empty were met with graphs and charts about how the economy is great because unemployment is low and inflation is lower.

We didn't call out them ignoring the democratic process and not allowing an open primary. We didn't call out the horrific 60-minutes interview or the continuous idiotic and pointless lies of Tim Waltz about the dumbest of things he didn't need to lie about. We didn't call out her inability to answer unscripted questions. We just said 'it's great she is going to win because it's good vs evil' and then they repeatedly called him a Nazi and used fear to make people think he was going to be a dictator.

Those of us who did call out her lack of policy and inability to separate herself from Biden's blunders were called MAGA supporters which you literally just did lol. So you say you will never stop calling out lack of / inept policy but you, the liberal elites and the MSM only criticize inept policy when it's coming from Republicans.

">The folk theory of democracy is grounded in the Enlightenment tradition of rational choice: voters seek information, weigh the available evidence and then choose the government with the strongest policies to deliver on their pledges.¬†


>According to the authors, this ideal bears little resemblance to how democracy actually works. In fact, the ‚Äòomnicompetent, sovereign citizen‚Äô found in the influential writings of Robert Dahl and Walt Whitman is an unattainable myth: voters are incapable and uninterested in fulfilling the role required of them by democracy. Most people are too busy with jobs and families to give politics sufficient attention: rather than spending their leisure time studying the minutiae of trade deals or infrastructure planning, they, quite understandably, pursue more enjoyable pastimes.¬†


>Even the minority of voters that have the time and inclination to inform themselves about politics do not behave as folk theory contends. When faced with choice in a democracy, human judgement is overwhelmed by the complexity of the world and bent by self-interest. Voters use information not to challenge their own opinions but to rationalise them, which the authors describe as ‚Äòenhanced bias‚Äô. To minimise cognitive dissonance ‚Äì when an individual holds inconsistent opinions or beliefs ‚Äì voters adjust their views to those of their favoured party, or simply avoid finding out what a party‚Äôs position is altogether if it conflicts with their own.¬†

"This is why things are going to get very scary for the housing market. The most likely outcome of the maga plan is hyperinflation. 

Savvy people dump their money into real estate in anticipation of hyperinflation. 

This will increase demand while the maga plan is, simultaneously, making it more impossible to increase supply (cost of labor will go up as many residential construction laborers are deported, and cost of materials will go up as the tariffs make them more costly to buy) 

So we‚Äôll have even more demand and even less supply. Making the prices even more unattainable.

Then there‚Äôs your whole point about mortgages, and what lenders will be doing.

Savvy people with high risk tolerance dump their money into real estate in anticipation of hyperinflation‚Ä¶ but they do it with BORROWED money. It is a means of, essentially, shorting the USD. 

How are lenders (and banks) supposed to handle this type of investor? And this type of environment in general? 

If those investors are right, and hyperinflation happens, the banks are taking a bath. If they are wrong, there could very well be another foreclosure crisis‚Ä¶ where banks end up owning a bunch of property in a plummeting market. 

Either way, their only solutions would be to either dramatically restrict lending and/or raise interest rates on their notes crazy high‚Ä¶ high enough to eliminate their own risk.

I locked in at 3.1 and could have still gotten sub-4 even if I wasn't going nuclear on my efforts to max out my credit rating.

You have about one, maybe two years to prepare for this by my estimate. Save as much as you can and if you have debt, e.g., credit cards, pay as much off as you can now. What's likely to happen at a national level is similar to 2008 - lots of unemployment, lots of businesses going under, lots of people losing homes and cars.

I agree that Democrats would have an extremely hard time winning over Republicans/MAGA/etc.  But at the end of the day Trump won significantly less votes this time compared to what he won when he *lost* the election last time.  The problem is that a lot of people who voted for Biden last time did not come out to vote for Kamala, and I find this comment to really ignore the elephant in the room.  The major difference isn't that there are just more hardcore MAGA people who would never vote for the Dems, it's that a significant amount of people who specifically voted *against* Trump and *for* a ticket with Kamala on the bill did not vote at all this time.

The leader of the BC Conservative was once a member of the (now defunct) BC Liberal party that got kicked out due to his views on climate change (among other things) and the party was full of people that were racist, anti-vax, pro-Maga - etc. They were surging because of the general anti-incumbency bias that is going on, but also because the BC Cons were riding on the wave of popularity of the current federal Conservative party of Canada, who are currently in opposition.

There were a number of people that were interviewed that thought that they were voting against Trudeau (current Prime Minister of Canada). Trudeau is not on the ballot, nor does his party (the Liberals) have a party in BC. But people were still there voting against him......",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Trump has never been in control of his life for as long as he's lived because he's an emotionally-crippled [victim of parental abuse](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/07/donald-trump-abuse-father-niece-mary-book) with an [untreated learning disability](https://www.divergents-magazine.org/articles/trump-s-likely-struggle-our-nation-s-consequences) who [can't pay attention to anything](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/05/intelligence-officials-reportedly-struggle-to-brief-donald-trump-because-hes-a-giant-toddler?srsltid=AfmBOor7h5HdC0HfiNiR8agyRxndVK4Umg3xFgpIVjomDL9EAV96e_iI) for any length of time and literally doesn't have the emotional or intellectual capacity even to [tell the truth on the witness stand to save himself](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/ex-trump-lawyer-told-mueller-trump-is-too-dumb-to-testify?srsltid=AfmBOorC9UeU9rc0pHgd91URC5sZ26dV1YiZGDEPyB8CXR7uCV5RBTOa).

Most people might have been sleeping or disassociating since 2016. I have not. I have read every book about the administration. I read every press release from Trump's first tenure in office, I read interviews and reports from people who worked with him, and I simply listened to the things he himself said and wrote and Tweeted.

Trump's two earlier campaigns in 1988 and 2000 coincided with releases of his book; he ran for President to market himself and sell books, which is all he's ever done. In 2000 he ""[ask(ed) top aide Roger Stone to find the ""most eminent hack writer in America"" to put Trump's political ideas into a book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2000_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Critics%20questioned%20the%20seriousness%20of,chance%20to%20win%20the%20election.)"". 

He only really ran for POTUS in 2016 [because he was continually trying to renegotiate his Apprentice salary higher](https://people.com/donald-trump-wanted-6-million-apprentice-salary-book-excerpt-8659327) and thought the publicity would improve his position.

He never wanted this job. You could see on a *daily* basis his entire tenure how much he fucking hated doing this job. 

He called the White House ['a dump'](https://time.com/4884923/white-house-donald-trump-dump/).

He [called his own voters who put him there ""digusting""](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/10/sunday-review/trump-supporters.html). 

He hates being POTUS nearly as much as most of us hate him being POTUS. He holds nearly as much contempt for his average voter as we do. He reviles occupying the office as much as it reviles us that he occupies it.

Now, going into his second term, his brain is scrambled and he's going to be forced into doing a job he doesn't understand and which is beyond his mental capacity, surrounded by people making demands of him day and night, hounding him, not letting him have free access to his phone or golf whenever he wants. 

In his first term as President Donald Trump [spent 307 days of his time in office playing golf](https://seattlemedium.com/donald-trump-spent-almost-a-year-playing-golf-during-presidency/), despite insulting Obama for playing golf on the campaign trail and claiming [he would be too busy to play golf as President if he were elected](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x74nsdu).

He played golf for an *entire year* of his presidency. After attacking Obama for doing the same. 

He's the laziest fucking person to ever disgrace politics.

If I weren't so firmly entrenched in the consequences of all of this, Donald Trump's story would be the fucking funniest comedy ever written. You literally could not write a better comedy than this. 

For better or worse Donald Trump is the most *transformative* President in history. He has destroyed and rewritten an entire half of the politicla system. He was handed a mandate and opportunities that nearly any leader in any age would have fucking killed for. 

The most tragic irony though, is that Donald Trump is the most *transformative* President in history. And he had at least the *potential*, the *opportunity*, to be the greatest President we ever had.

Party politics has eroded our system to the point of dysfunction. We all know it. People voted for an arsonist because the current system is so broken and divided that they are like animals lashing out at it. Democrat and Republican alike. 

So to you Trump voters: I see you. I understand what you *believe* he could be. 

Trump could have broken apart the entrenched systems of Democrat and Rpeublican and united us. He could have broken to bits the norms that have kept our system exclusively for the wealthy, he could have made th government truly transparent and effective.

Now believe me when I say that he didn't do *any* of that in his first term, and he won't do any of it in his second term, because he's oafish, impetuous, lazy, narcissistic, and intellectually stunted and incurious and profoundly amoral. 

He is [the first-ever convicted felon](https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0) we've elected to office, and his first act, if he lasts long enough to make a first act, will to be to dismiss all cases against him and pardon himself in the greatest act of corruption we've ever witnessed at this political level. 

He surrounds himself with criminals. [Dozens of former people in his administration were convicted of crimes and/or served time](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/cohen-trump-prison-what-matters/index.html). Or one should say criminals are attracted *to* him, because he's an amoral, guileless stooge who will empower them to commit all manner of corruption without judgment.

And now he's surrounded by sociopaths who will set the agenda for him. [People like Peter Thiel](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/peter-thiel-donald-trump-vance-hulk-hogan/), who [groomed and installed Trump's current VP, JD Vance.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-trump-vp-peter-thiel-billionaire/). 

Thiel, who thanks to Democracy just won extraordinary power, [doesn't believe in Democracy and is involved in politics to destroy it](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/11/peter-thiel-2024-election-politics-investing-life-views/675946/), which is perhaps why a lot of us view Donald Trump's second term as an existential threat to Democracy. 

You know. Because of all the people surrounding him who have said they want to destroy Democracy.  What you need to understand is despite all that - despite the grand criminal ambitions of people around him, Donald Trump is not like that. Donald Trump's crimes are all baser, savage crimes of opportunity. 

[Stealing documents to sell to a highest bidder.](https://news.wttw.com/2023/06/08/donald-trump-says-he-s-been-indicted-charges-mishandling-classified-documents)

[Lying on all his business documents](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/08/politics/fact-check-trump-claims-documents-investigation/index.html). 

He's a relentless pathological liar who will do anything in each moment of his life to benefit himself regardless of hte cost to others or even the consequence to himself.

But he's not a *good* liar. And we know this because when it matters - when he's in a position where lying will present consequences for him, such as in court, he cannot maintain a lie to save himself.

[His own laywers have said he is too dumb to testify](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/ex-trump-lawyer-told-mueller-trump-is-too-dumb-to-testify?srsltid=AfmBOorC9UeU9rc0pHgd91URC5sZ26dV1YiZGDEPyB8CXR7uCV5RBTOa).

He couldn't resist [petulant and egregiously self-incriminating remarks on the witness stand in the NY case](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-made-sharply-self-incriminating-statementglenn-kirschner-1971272) because he refuses to prep with his lawyers because he is impatient and a fucking idiot.

He can lie with *conviction* but he can't remember the lie he just told a second ago. 

All of this to say, he knows he's fucked, and he's miserable. That's why you [haven't seen him gloating this time around](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/trump-x-truth-social-djt-election.html). Have you ever in the last ten years known this fucking idiot to shut the fuck up, *especially* after probably the greatest underdog victory of his life? 

And now that he's in power, Putin and Netanyahu and the Heritage Foundation and all those deplorable crooks that helped get in him power and going to work him to fucking death, and he knows it and can't do a thing to stop it, because those people understand power. Those people cultivate it. Putin and Thiel and all these people are monsters, but they're patient, and strategic, and calculating, and Donald Trump is an idiot in a diaper who just wants a diet coke and doesn't give a fuck who dies for him to get it.

And all the people deifying him and painting his likeness on barns will never know how much Donald Trump fucking hates them. How little he regards them. How vile and repulsive he finds them. How much he laments that *they* are the ones who exemplify him.

It's all so fucking funny. Or would be, if not for the fact it's real and a lot of people are going to get hurt and die because of it.

"241110_Russia-TV-Airs-Melania-Nudes_Baboon-Mounts

In a baboon troop the most senior troop leader has to assert his dominance every once in a while. This is done symbolically so he doesn't have to fight the younger males all the time. It's enough that he is able to get a willing subordinate to abase himself. If that willing subordinate is also recognized as being reasonably strong, it will cause the young upstarts to think twice about challenging the top leader. 

But sometimes things will happen that disrupt the troop. Sometimes a large predator will come by, and cause all the other members of the troop to be insecure, even when that predator has been driven away. Sometimes there is an encounter with another troop, with a bit of tension between them. And maybe one of the other senior males was more closely involved in asserting the troops territory to the interlopers. Just a matter of standing tall and large and baring teeth. And even though hostilities didn't openly break out, the tension is enough to shake up the hierarchy a little bit. Which is enough to give some of the younger males ideas. 

When things like this happen, The troop leader needs to make a statement. Especially if one of the subordinates has gained some points by some action. The troop leader needs to have that male submit to him in order to ensure that everybody knows what's what. And so the leader will go over to the other male and mount him. Or the leader may go to the female who is favored by that other male and mount her. And if the subordinate male does not object, then the hierarchy is affirmed for everyone.
Putin sees that Donald Trump could be riding high on his electoral victory. And so he ""mounts"" Melania. And Donald's silence speaks volumes.

"I completely agree with your point that Trump had the chance to reform the establishment system and put more populist policies in effect that would generally help people. In fact he kind of ran too well on that platform because a lot of people seem to want populist policies. You can kind of see in 2016 after he was elected that he could have gone that way, but didn't, and I think maybe he realized he could make more money if he just maintained the status quo.

The problem was because he's such an idiot, he went too far and trapped himself in the cycle because if he didn't keep running, he would go to prison. You can tell he isn't enjoying it anymore. I first realized it when he picked Vance as VP because usually in the past there would have been tons of grandstanding and buildup,  but there wasn't. He just brought him out and said here he is. His rallies are just so low energy and repetitive. I think he's actually annoyed because getting elected ruined his life in a lot of ways.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Most people might have been sleeping or disassociating since 2016. I have not. I have read every book about the administration. I read every press release from Trump's first tenure in office, I read interviews and reports from people who worked with him, and I simply listened to the things he himself said and wrote and Tweeted.

Trump's two earlier campaigns in 1988 and 2000 coincided with releases of his book; he ran for President to market himself and sell books, which is all he's ever done. In 2000 he ""[ask(ed) top aide Roger Stone to find the ""most eminent hack writer in America"" to put Trump's political ideas into a book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2000_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Critics%20questioned%20the%20seriousness%20of,chance%20to%20win%20the%20election.)"". 

He only really ran for POTUS in 2016 [because he was continually trying to renegotiate his Apprentice salary higher](https://people.com/donald-trump-wanted-6-million-apprentice-salary-book-excerpt-8659327) and thought the publicity would improve his position.

He never wanted this job. You could see on a *daily* basis his entire tenure how much he fucking hated doing this job. 

He called the White House ['a dump'](https://time.com/4884923/white-house-donald-trump-dump/).

He [called his own voters who put him there ""digusting""](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/10/sunday-review/trump-supporters.html). 

He hates being POTUS nearly as much as most of us hate him being POTUS. He holds nearly as much contempt for his average voter as we do. He reviles occupying the office as much as it reviles us that he occupies it.

Now, going into his second term, his brain is scrambled and he's going to be forced into doing a job he doesn't understand and which is beyond his mental capacity, surrounded by people making demands of him day and night, hounding him, not letting him have free access to his phone or golf whenever he wants. 

In his first term as President Donald Trump [spent 307 days of his time in office playing golf](https://seattlemedium.com/donald-trump-spent-almost-a-year-playing-golf-during-presidency/), despite insulting Obama for playing golf on the campaign trail and claiming [he would be too busy to play golf as President if he were elected](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x74nsdu).

He played golf for an *entire year* of his presidency. After attacking Obama for doing the same. 

He's the laziest fucking person to ever disgrace politics.

If I weren't so firmly entrenched in the consequences of all of this, Donald Trump's story would be the fucking funniest comedy ever written. You literally could not write a better comedy than this. 

For better or worse Donald Trump is the most *transformative* President in history. He has destroyed and rewritten an entire half of the politicla system. He was handed a mandate and opportunities that nearly any leader in any age would have fucking killed for. 

The most tragic irony though, is that Donald Trump is the most *transformative* President in history. And he had at least the *potential*, the *opportunity*, to be the greatest President we ever had.

Party politics has eroded our system to the point of dysfunction. We all know it. People voted for an arsonist because the current system is so broken and divided that they are like animals lashing out at it. Democrat and Republican alike. 

So to you Trump voters: I see you. I understand what you *believe* he could be. 

Trump could have broken apart the entrenched systems of Democrat and Rpeublican and united us. He could have broken to bits the norms that have kept our system exclusively for the wealthy, he could have made th government truly transparent and effective.

Now believe me when I say that he didn't do *any* of that in his first term, and he won't do any of it in his second term, because he's oafish, impetuous, lazy, narcissistic, and intellectually stunted and incurious and profoundly amoral. 

He is [the first-ever convicted felon](https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0) we've elected to office, and his first act, if he lasts long enough to make a first act, will to be to dismiss all cases against him and pardon himself in the greatest act of corruption we've ever witnessed at this political level. 

He surrounds himself with criminals. [Dozens of former people in his administration were convicted of crimes and/or served time](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/cohen-trump-prison-what-matters/index.html). Or one should say criminals are attracted *to* him, because he's an amoral, guileless stooge who will empower them to commit all manner of corruption without judgment.

And now he's surrounded by sociopaths who will set the agenda for him. [People like Peter Thiel](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/peter-thiel-donald-trump-vance-hulk-hogan/), who [groomed and installed Trump's current VP, JD Vance.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-trump-vp-peter-thiel-billionaire/). 

Thiel, who thanks to Democracy just won extraordinary power, [doesn't believe in Democracy and is involved in politics to destroy it](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/11/peter-thiel-2024-election-politics-investing-life-views/675946/), which is perhaps why a lot of us view Donald Trump's second term as an existential threat to Democracy. 

You know. Because of all the people surrounding him who have said they want to destroy Democracy.  What you need to understand is despite all that - despite the grand criminal ambitions of people around him, Donald Trump is not like that. Donald Trump's crimes are all baser, savage crimes of opportunity. 

[Stealing documents to sell to a highest bidder.](https://news.wttw.com/2023/06/08/donald-trump-says-he-s-been-indicted-charges-mishandling-classified-documents) 

[Paying off a porn star and not discolsing it on forms](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/30/trump-indicted-in-porn-star-hush-money-payment-case-00089837). 

[Lying on all his business documents](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/08/politics/fact-check-trump-claims-documents-investigation/index.html). 

He's a relentless pathological liar who will do anything in each moment of his life to benefit himself regardless of hte cost to others or even the consequence to himself.

But he's not a *good* liar. And we know this because when it matters - when he's in a position where lying will present consequences for him, such as in court, he cannot maintain a lie to save himself.

[His own laywers have said he is too dumb to testify](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/ex-trump-lawyer-told-mueller-trump-is-too-dumb-to-testify?srsltid=AfmBOorC9UeU9rc0pHgd91URC5sZ26dV1YiZGDEPyB8CXR7uCV5RBTOa).

He couldn't resist [petulant and egregiously self-incriminating remarks on the witness stand in the NY case](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-made-sharply-self-incriminating-statementglenn-kirschner-1971272) because he refuses to prep with his lawyers because he is impatient and a fucking idiot.

He can lie with *conviction* but he can't remember the lie he just told a second ago. 

All of this to say, he knows he's fucked, and he's miserable. That's why you [haven't seen him gloating this time around](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/trump-x-truth-social-djt-election.html). Have you ever in the last ten years known this fucking idiot to shut the fuck up, *especially* after probably the greatest underdog victory of his life? 

And now that he's in power, Putin and Netanyahu and the Heritage Foundation and all those deplorable crooks that helped get in him power and going to work him to fucking death, and he knows it and can't do a thing to stop it, because those people understand power. Those people cultivate it. Putin and Thiel and all these people are monsters, but they're patient, and strategic, and calculating, and Donald Trump is an idiot in a diaper who just wants a diet coke and doesn't give a fuck who dies for him to get it.

And all the people deifying him and painting his likeness on barns will never know how much Donald Trump fucking hates them. How little he regards them. How vile and repulsive he finds them. How much he laments that *they* are the ones who exemplify him.

It's all so fucking funny. Or would be, if not for the fact it's real and a lot of people are going to get hurt and die because of it.

And you might say, ""well if he's so stupid how come he keeps getting away with all of it?"" 

And the answer is, you. Because you vote for him. You empower him. You refuse to step out from the veil of denial and just look at the person you keep empowering. A person who cannot and will not give you a god damn thing. Who despises you, who will use you and discard you as he does everyone else in his life.

Because at the end of the day he doesn't really need to be smart, or clever, or rich. At the end of the day he only needs to be able to con *you*.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"It's worth noting that a $2 trillion dollar cut to spending is nearly a third of the budget. Mandatory expenditures made up about 60% of the 2023 fiscal year budget. Mandatory expenditures are things like paying interest on the national debt, social security, and medicare and because congress controls the purse strings, congress would need to make cuts to those expenses, it's not something the executive branch can just do unilaterally. Not saying it's impossible to do that, but I think most republicans know it's a bad idea to cut benefits of their older constituents.

The remaining expenditures are discretionary, but are still decided on by congress via appropriations. Again, not something the executive branch can just do unilaterally. Cutting 2 trillion from the discretionary expenses would be things like NASA, subsidies, contracts with companies like Space X, Military spending (which companies like L3Harris and Lockheed might have a problem with having cut) including maintenance of bases around the world, keeping satellites from falling out of the sky, paying service members, Bureau of Land Management (which oversees things like leases of public land for cattle ranchers), etc.

The executive branch comes up with a budget proposal which is then debated and negotiated in the legislature. The funding for mandatory expenses is largely laid out by law and while the executive branch can suggest changes, it is ultimately congress that would have to make that change. and that's 60% of the budget. So a 2 trillion dollar cut without congress ransacking SS and medicare would mean eliminating massive swathes of federal agencies and the military.

It's a pipe dream. Pipe nightmare, maybe.

Or they will just try to blame everything on Biden. Either way they need to adapt or be ready to lose to JD Vance in 2028 after he goes on all these popular podcasts and Democrats stay away.

"Joe Rogan was sympathetic and even had some lefty views when he was first getting big. However because he did not agree with the loud left wing activists on everything he got endless hate from them.

Rogan is the prime example of how the hyper online left can overstep and end up wagging the dog of politicians. They bullied him right out of the coalition. 

I dont agree with Rogan about everything, but he is willing to have opposing voices on and mix things up. Any appearance by Harris on the podcast would have been good, but there should have been years of dem politicians and left wing figure heads laying the ground work.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

If you listen to Joe he is insanely open minded and generally asks the obvious questions.

Since he is so open minded he will, at times, even change his mind or at least make it appear that he does during that four hours.

Pandering to voters and extremist views swings both ways - it has clearly alienated lots of people. Some examples include - sanctuary cities vs border security, women's rights and allowing transgender men to compete in sports vs women, law enforcement vs defunding the police.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

His show‚Äôs visibility is so massive that an interview with a relatively unknown comedian or even a boring conspiracy theorist can get double the views in a single day than our debate did.

Rogan is one of the few right-leaning figures who actually listens and gives his guests a chance to speak. He has fans across the political spectrum.

Seriously. No one had any issues with Kamala's campaign until she lost. Literally everyone said she ran a flawless campaign, and the only time anyone started doubting it was election night. Even then, we were all confused as to how things ended up so badly. Many of us still are.

You all loved the fact she was able to bring people together across party lines to fight for what is right. Maybe you didn't like Dick Cheney, but it was an incredible feat, nonetheless.

You loved her policies. You loved her plans. You loved her work ethic.

We all agreed she was the obvious choice, considering the other guy is a rapist, an insurrectionist, and a convicted felon.

We all agreed she was the obvious choice, considering his economic plans are rated the absolute worst between the two candidates. Trump will likely lead us into another recession/depression and his increase to the deficit will be worse than last time.

We all thought she was the obvious choice, considering Trump's next cabinet pick is as likely to be Kid Rock as it is to be Rudy Giuliani.

We all thought she was the obvious choice, considering Trump is planning to turn the US military against political rivals, pundits, immigrants, and more than likely, eventually, the rest of us.

We all thought she was the obvious choice because she was a prosecutor and Trump was a felon who wanted to pardon J6 traitors.

I could go on and on, but I've made my point.

Right now, the post-mortem is more about how the democrats should have worked harder to tell MAGA what they wanted to hear. Tell me, though, how would that have been any different than the campaign Kamala already ran?

By going on Joe Rogan? What, exactly, is Kamala's message for incels and other general misogynists who say things like, ""your body, my choice""? How does Kamala swing the KKK and Proud Boys to vote for her? How does she convince Puerto Ricans, who are OK with being called trash to their faces, to vote for her?

What is her message for the working class people who mocked her when she spoke about coming from a middle-class family and working at McDonald's?

What is her message for the people who constantly rose the bar higher and higher for her while lowering it further and further for Trump?

What is the message for the people who heard Trump say things like, ""theeey're eating the doowwwgs"" during a debate she clearly won but they voted for him anyways?

The reality is that we have a very large portion of the population who is hell-bent on ignorance, chaos, and revenge. Our only hope now is that they feel it and make a change next time (if possible). Although I seriously doubt they will. It will always be the democrats' fault; largely because the democrats keep telling them they're right.

Like the famous Marco Rubio gaf with Chris Christie. 

But I think a lot of politicians aren't suited for the changing news landscape with podcasters, because when the interview is an hour long or even 3 hours, when you do those rehearsed talking points over and over again, you come off as insincere and not authentic. In contrast someone like Trump, that likes to babble on about random things, wherever his train of thought takes him, kinda thrives on that environment.

"Trump's podcast with Rogan reached 23 million views on youtube within 24 hours.  In an election that is decided by small margins, that's a number you cannot afford to concede to your opponents.  

Rogan spent years not wanting Trump on his podcast.  I think that if Harris went on JRE, he would not have endorsed Trump.  I think Rogan's Trump endorsement (when you consider he is naturally a Bernie bro) only happened because Joe perceived Kamala as a coward, and I agree with that sentiment.  

There was also David Ramsey: when he asked to interview both Trump and Harris, Trump asked Ramsey ""when and where?"", Harris declined the interview.  

Joe Rogan and Dave Ramsey are NOT small potatoes, Rogan is the #1 podcaster in the world, Ramsey is a giant in the personal finance space.  Conceding this ground to Trump, and not doing an appearance, with two guys who are NOT political and are not going to ask difficult questions, is lunacy.  They are not going to ask highly-detailed policy questions, they are just going to verify that you are a functioning human being.  

In the 2028 cycle, if a Democratic candidate for president is incapable of doing 3 hours on JRE, they will not win the nomination.  In 2028, people are going to want to see the JRE appearance BEFORE the primary process starts.  

Trump was able to do these podcasts, and Harris completely conceded that entire space by running away from it.  

It's not even that young men, and male voters in general, are the dominant audience of these podcasts, it's that her refusal to even appear branded her as a coward who was afraid to do it.  Right or wrong, you don't get to define yourself when you don't even show up.  

Jim Gaffigan yelled at her about it from the podium at the Al Smith dinner: Northern Pennsylvania is heavily Catholic.  The Al Smith Dinner is the biggest Catholic charity shin-dig around.  Harris skipped it, Trump was at least there.  Are you trying to convince Catholics you hate them?  Because that's how you convince Catholics you hate them.  

What's frustrating is that these are all low hanging fruit.  The Al Smith dinner isn't hard, Rogan isn't hard, Dave Ramsey isn't hard.  This isn't an interview at the world economic summit, you show up, tell a few jokes, tell a few stories, answer a few easy questions and that's it.  

If you showed up and bombed, at least you showed up.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"Thank you!  
  
Literally I have been repeatedly downvoted for even the slightest suggestion that Democrats going on centrist and center-left leaning podcasts would help spread their beliefs and personalities to people who do not know or aren't familiar with who they are. You can't expect people to feel confident in who you are if you say or recite the same exact talking points every interview. You have to be loose and confident, but managed and disciplined. You can't say you want to give prisoners sex changes, but you can say you want to fight the billionaire takeover of the United States economy and political system.

The more big names and small names we get out on these platforms to talk about issues like Citizens United, Shelby County v Holder, Republican obstructionism in the Senate of everything, the amount of money that Republicans raise from billionaires to SuperPACs, and why immigration is NOT in any remote way of farming votes from brown people, and is more about combating inflation and ensuring efficiency in labor markets, the better off the message of truth to power will get out.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

I voted blue, but the interviews I watched of hers (60 minutes, call her daddy) did not particularly make her more likable to me. 

I would have loved to see Harris on Rogan. Rogan is known for not pushing back very hard on guests and I think she could have steered the conversation fairly well.

Trump was saying, ‚ÄúOh, she couldn‚Äôt do an interview with you. She‚Äôd have a panic attack, she‚Äôd have to leave in an ambulance,‚Äù and things like that.

Rogan was explaining, no, like he legitimately just wanted to talk to her for a few hours and get to know her. 

As much as I don‚Äôt like the guy, I think he was being sincere about that because that‚Äôs just what he usually does. He just talks to them. He will push back when he disagrees. But, he mostly just talks to people. 

It‚Äôs part of what makes his show kind of a problem when it comes to misinformation. Because he‚Äôll bring in conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers and picks their brain because he thinks it‚Äôs interesting. But even if he pushes back, he‚Äôs still giving the guest a platform.

"It‚Äôs a change in media consumption. 20-30 years ago you watched legacy media largely if you didn‚Äôt attend political events. In some aspects it‚Äôs good as they can be long format and we can see a more thought out approach from a candidate or a humanizing view. The questions are whether or not these podcasts and podcasters are equipped to potentially pose thoughtful or important questions and have political knowledge to test these candidates. That being said we are in an era where most folks want to hear a politician who is human and talks in a non uniform speech, someone who doesn‚Äôt need a teleprompter or an outline of what will be discussed. That does great for humanizing a candidate but often means we will never get great conversation about policy and actual important scenarios these candidates run on. Trump did well because he can talk forever about anything and hyped and butters every podcaster up who gives him a platform. Less and less ppl trust traditional forms of media for providing factual or accurate non biased information and as the millennial and gen z generation get older that method of consumption will continue to change. I‚Äôd wager millennials only know and sometimes pay attention to legacy media because they grew up with it and watched internet become the new beacon of information as children to adults.

Pete can win because he isn‚Äôt afraid to go anywhere. We need more politicians who can show up and be normal,2024_11_12,04_33_33
"It is because podcasts by their nature are more independent.

If you are the Dem establishment and you see a podcast, you are less likely to want to engage with it because you run the risk of your host antagonizing you. If you were the MSM and you were hostile to any of them, you can kiss getting anymore interviews with politicians they depend on for views good bye. Podcasts don‚Äôt have to rely on them to function, though. It‚Äôs not like Joe Rogan had a politician on every single week.

Furthermore, the establishment Dems are so manicured and hyper focused on presentation that you could never throw Kamala on any podcast that isn‚Äôt something like Call Me Daddy. Kamala is an awkward woman who seems like she has no interests and hobbies in anything outside of work. She is the kind of person who would be so concerned about ‚Äúoh my god, how many voters am I losing to republicans if I say that I tried out some weed when I was young and in college?‚Äù that she doesn‚Äôt realize that podcast audiences don‚Äôt give a shit about any of that and just want someone who is genuine.

Trump can do this. He can talk about doing a line of coke on a podcast. He can talk about golf. He can talk about cars. He can talk about whatever the fuck the other person is interested in. In sales, if you want to be someone‚Äôs friend and get the sale, whatever they want to talk about hobby wise, you are going to sit there for the next 20 minutes and fucking wax poetic about how cool cars are or some shit. Trump gets this.

Meanwhile, what do we actually know about Kamala? In fact, do you know how well equipped she was to be casual? This bitch worked in McDonald‚Äôs as a young adult. Go fucking bitch about how awful that job was like every other person who walks away from it. She never could because god forbid McDonalds stops donating to them and the young audience she should be relating to doesn‚Äôt relate to how grueling and awful being in a minimum wage dead end job is. 

Instead, she doesn‚Äôt capitalize on that life experience and she lets Trump overtake her on the McDonald‚Äôs thing because bro actually shows up for a fucking shift on camera at McDonalds and then looks super personable toward the people going through the drive thru window. Forget about how that was all staged, it‚Äôs all about the impression he gave doing that.

This is why they could never and Bernie actually pulls this shit off. At least he shows up on Theo Von and actually manages to connect with the man by leading him to think about socialism on his own.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"Democrats operate under the assumption that they should focus on unbiased media to make their arguments, and refrain from the appearance of ‚Äúcrossing a line‚Äù and endorsing partisan media outlets and groups.

To them, building the media ecosystem that republicans exploit over and over would be inconsistent with their morals, and going on these clearly left leaning partisan shows would be akin to legitimizing organizations like Fox News that have become a de-facto mouthpiece of the Republican Party and shrugs off any attempt towards separation of the media and politician.

">¬†I wonder why it was hard for the Democrats on this?

2 reasons.

First of all, democrats just don‚Äôt wade into media as much. The old argument was, they were too busy legislating while conservatives only had to obstruct. It‚Äôs a different amount of effort. So conservatives literally have more time to tour.

And secondly, and perhaps even more cynically, legacy media industries and businesses are a huge component of democratic donor support. They ain‚Äôt biting the hand that feeds them.

This trouble would be greatly alleviated if the Democrats ran on easily defensible working class principles rather than whatever cobbled up stuff Harris ran on, some of which directly contradicted long standing Democrat stances such as lowering oil production or fighting against rightwing border policies. 

Another thing you see in many of these podcasts that Trump was on was that it was very light on policy and politics. A lot of personal conversations and talking about random topics. What you got to see was Trump as an approachable, friendly person. The potential trouble you can run into with ""left-leaning"" podcasts is that you have a lot of political talk show podcasts that talk left wing politics all the time, which most people would think of when they think of left-leaning podcasts, and that would stop the the sort of friendly, easygoing conversation that Trump had with Theo von or Joe Rogan.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

That makes his show a convenient place for anybody to spout their beliefs because he will be a mouthpiece for basically anything. Had Harris gone on the show after Trump and gave it a half decent effort, there's a pretty good chance he would have complimented her, repeated her strong points or possibly even endorsed her instead.

This often then finds the root of the disagreement, that people are looking at different sources for facts, which moves the conversation forward to that issue.

"\> How a man with basically no strong political opinions of his own became the de facto political spokesperson nwlforca whole demographic, i'll never know.

It's fairly simple.

1-He's not primarily a political commentator. His show is normally just whoever he finds interesting.     
I don't really watch it myself but I will occasionally put it on if he has a guest that might be cool (for example physicist Brian Cox was on not that long ago).      
Since it's not normally a political show people who aren't normally all that interested in politics watch it.

2-It's long form content where people just get to talk.     
Rogan's big skill is that he is really good at keeping conversations going.     
Which means that when someone interesting is on there talking about something you find interesting, they get to finish talking. It's not ""and we've passed 20 minutes so we'll hate to cut you off there. Interesting stuff"". People get to just tell you about their passion until they're actually done talking about it.

People like hearing people talk about stuff they're excited about. Doesn't matter if it's a hunter, a physicist, a doctor, or whatever else.     
It's someone who really cares about something who gets to tell you about it for 2 hours, and that passion is easy to catch.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Because every Democratic primary in recent years has resulted in the person with vastly more votes becoming the winning candidate.

The delegates were free to vote however they liked, and Harris was simply the only realistic option as his VP.

"In a way, that fact might make this a good thing. I am increasingly of the opinion that maybe Americans need to actually see how repugnant Trump is in order to defeat Trumpism. Mass deportations will be terrible for the economy. But there has always been a pretty big chance that Trump will have his economic advisers successfully convince him of that, leading him to do small, symbolic deportations that grab media attention but don't actually hurt the economy, leading people to think Trump's insane immigration policy is good when actually he just didn't really implement it. I don't think Miller is gonna do that. Miller is gonna go full-on military mass deportations. It's going to be terrible and cause a lot of human misery. But it also might tank the economy, causing Trump to lose his weird mystique as an economic wizard, and it might make all those Trump-supporting Latinos who thought ""he isn't talking about me"" realize ""oh, yeah, he is talking about me,""",2024_11_12,04_33_33

>""President Trump was elected by the American people to carry out his agenda, which includes:

>Securing the southern border, mass deportations of illegal aliens (beginning with rapists and murderers), surging resources to process immigration/asylum claims to clear out backlog and end widespread abuse of the asylum system, ending automatic citizenship for children of illegal aliens, and taking federal actions to prevent sanctuary cities from obstructing federal immigration enforcement,

>Restoring law and order across our country, including rescuing our cities from mob violence and left-wing soft on crime prosecutors,

>Immediately stopping the lawfare and persecution of political opponents that is unprecedented in American history and destroying our democracy,

>Granting pardons or commutations to January 6th defendants and other defendants who have been subjected to politically-driven lawfare prosecutions and sentences,

>Abolishing DEI in government and taking action against those companies and universities that engage in racial discrimination,

>Protecting Americans‚Äô right to speech, religion, and the Second Amendment,

>Protecting religious liberties, including investigating and prosecuting the horrific antisemitism ripping through this country,

>Protecting parents‚Äô rights from irreparable transgender surgeries and procedures on minor children, and investigating those who have pushed this on minor children;

>Paving the way for an energy boom and American Energy Golden Age,

>And holding accountable those who weaponized their government authority to abuse Americans.

>These are all positions President Trump campaigned on and that career DOJ lawyers may be working on to accomplish President Trump‚Äôs lawful agenda that was approved by a landslide vote of the American People. DOJ career employees do not set the agenda. In fact, they are required to help implement this agenda.

>Hopefully, they will be as committed to helping President Trump implement his agenda as they did for President Biden. Of course, political leadership welcomes feedback to help improve a project. But once the decision is made to move forward, career employees are required to implement the President‚Äôs plan.

>Of course, no one will push them to implement flagrantly illegal actions like President Biden did with his student loan plan, where he thumbed his nose at the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling and then tried to implement another illegal plan which was struck down. (In fact, the media was cheering on his law-breaking).  I don‚Äôt recall reading any stories about career attorneys being concerned about working on this blatantly illegal action.

>If these career DOJ employees won‚Äôt implement President Trump‚Äôs program in good faith, they should leave. Those employees who engage in so-called ‚Äúresistance‚Äù against the duly-elected President‚Äôs lawful agenda would be subverting American democracy.

>Finally, those that take such actions would be subject to disciplinary measures, including termination.

>I look forward to President Trump‚Äôs team Making America Great Again, especially at the Department of Justice and the FBI.""",2024_11_12,04_33_33

‚ÄúHistorians will have a word for Americans who joined the MAGA Republicans, not because they hated Immigrants, LGBTQ, and black people, but out of a hope for restored patriotism, or a sense of economic anxiety, or a hope to preserve their religious values, or dislike of their opponents, or raw political opportunism, or convenience, or ignorance, or greed.

That word is ""MAGA."" Nobody cares about their motives anymore.

The young woman got sepsis and died. So you think this is fear mongering. It's not. No. It's very real.

 Lavender scare all over again. Make something into an issue which is already not an issue. And in the process make trans folks seem like some sort of dirty disgusting people- othering them.

They fail to see the perspective that it's *not* fun, nor is it popular, to be different in *that* way, especially now.

"Going through the wrong puberty has many physical effects on trans children, and the standard treatment is only puberty blockers until the child is 16-18 (generally 18, but there are exceptions in extreme circumstances), and the only surgeries minors can get are breast reduction surgeries in cases like you suggest.

We also *do* prescribe medications to children for purely psychological conditions all the time: antidepressants, anti-psychosis medication, adhd treatments, etc. Puberty blockers and HRT have similarly crucial psychological medications for trans teenagers. Refusing to treat children who are suffering psychologically because they're not yet adults would be cruel and dangerous.

What you suggest is basically the current standard of care. But just like with abortion access, making laws about that, rather than allowing physicians to treat patients based on their needs and medical standards, can put some patients in very dangerous places.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"The funding a school receives for a student with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) can vary widely based on several factors, including:

1. State and Local Funding Models: Each state has its own funding formula for special education, which can include federal, state, and local sources. Some states provide additional funding specifically for students with disabilities.
2. Federal Funding: The federal government provides funding through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which covers a portion of the costs associated with special education. However, this funding typically covers only about 15% of the excess costs of educating students with disabilities.
3. Specific Needs of the Student: The amount can also depend on the specific needs outlined in the IEP. More intensive services (like one-on-one support or specialized programs) may require more funding.
4. School District Budget: Each school district has its own budget and resources, which can influence how much they can allocate for special education services.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"Let's be clear. Elon Musk isn't JUST a celebrity anymore. He's not even a tech CEO or business entrepreneur.

He's a billionaire, mining and tech magnate has positioned himself dangerously close to the incoming President of the United states. He has a track record of volatile and unpredictable behaviour, he's got confirmed ties to Vladimir Putin and seems to have an unprecedented level of access to political Intel for a civilian in the private sector. And this is a man who's had a string of failed relationships, familial dramas and fall outs with his children. While not all of the above may be his fault per se, it does speak volumes to his ability to tackle complex issues, resolve interpersonal problems and handle relationships with others. All key skills in the political arena.

His erratic notions and behaviours are of public concern because he's put himself in a position to influence the public. Despite never being elected by said public to do so. 

So now that he's put himself on that stage of politics, his personal life, his business decisions, his family dramas *are* a matter of public interest.

The man could very well have access and authority to shape the financial futures of the nation, you should pay attention to someone with that power over you. Because the time may come where people need to make an informed decision about whether or not they consent to be ruled over by a man that doesn't have the temperament and interpersonal skills to handle leadership.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"I mean I don't know that I would go that far. The pandemic response from the perspective of people in hospitals got significantly better when Biden took office, and it's entirely possible that Trump's administration could have fucked up the vaccine roll out. They also almost certainly would have mismanaged the inflation. We would have been absolutely fucked that entire 4 years, and much worse off financially. But, he would have fully taken the blame for the Dobbs decision, we'd be in a recession if not a depression and this year probably would have been a bloodbath for the Republicans 

He could not have run as VP if he won in 2020. The VP has to be eligible to become president, and he would not have been after serving two terms. If that were possible we would have run Obama as VP at some point.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"Sure, I agree that it may happen. But do you understand that he's going to enact tariffs in order to get these countries to stop taking advantage of us? Thus forcing renegotiations? Countries charge American companies a large percentage to do business on their soil. And it's been going on for decades. A good example of this is what Trump did with the leader of France. He threatened him with a 100% tariff on wine and champagne being shipped into the United States‚Äîand immediately saved American companies from being taken advantage of. These tariffs will also, we hope, convince greedy American corporations to end operations overseas and bring business back to the US. If I were Trump, I'd go after Nike first. Steve Madden (the shoe brand), after Trump was elected recently, announced they are bringing back a portion of their business to the USA. So just as an example, the process is already working and it's not even been executed. People hear ""tariffs"" and immediately assume the worst. What they don't do is understand the strategy behind it, and the long-term benefits. And yes, there are pros and cons to everything. But people fail to see the bigger picture.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Also, the cost of deporting all of these people will be insane. You need staffing - which will also mean that there will be more crime elsewhere due to a lack of resources. Staffing, clown show investigatations, courts, holding cells, getting them out of the country (where do we drop these people off?) all will be on our dime. 

Farms will be understaffed because of the pay and labor associated with these jobs. The Idaho Dairymen‚Äôs Association estimates that 89 percent of the state‚Äôs on-site dairy workers are foreign-born. Nationally the number may be closer to 51 percent, according to a survey published in 2015 by Texas A&M.

"From the Opinion columnist Paul Krugman: ""We just elected a president who, if he follows through on two of his central campaign promises ‚Äî across-the-board tariffs and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants ‚Äî will probably cause soaring inflation,"" writes Paul.

The companies are certainly not going to just eat that cost increase. It might hurt their margins a bit if people tighten their belts because stuff is more expensive, but they're not going to keep prices where they're at while their costs go up.

how maga chuds don't understand that (misinformed? gaslit? willful ignorance?) is a mystery to me. it just takes about five seconds and as many brain cells to ask yourself where these people are working and how it might impact the economy if they disappear.

>CoreCivic and Geo Group, the two biggest private prison operators in the U.S., both contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to house detained, undocumented migrants. Their stocks soared Wednesday following Trump‚Äôs election win, with investors betting the companies will see increased profits from a tough-on-immigration administration.

>Both Geo Group and CoreCivic said they currently have excess capacity to accommodate a larger population of detainees. CoreCivic executives noted that they‚Äôre taking steps to prepare to activate additional capacity to meet ICE‚Äôs needs. That could include reconfiguring facilities to accommodate a bigger intake area, they noted. 

>""There is room for an uptick in occupancy from a capacity standpoint and both companies expect an ask from the Trump administration for more beds. The question is how much, and we just don‚Äôt know right now,‚Äù Wedbush Securities analyst Brian Violino told CBS MoneyWatch.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Apple trees do fine, but there's only one harvest season for those and it's like a month at most.

International law only matters when they perceive that it benefits us (which is regrettably an idea not limited to the right, even if it's more prevalent there)

They don't care that a lot of these people are families being terrorized by gangs. Their sons are being pressured into joining. Y'all seen Clint Eastwood's 2008 film Gran Torino? The guy's sister is beaten and raped by her cousin's friends because he refuses to join up with his cousin's detroit ghetto gang. Poverty is of course a major factor in gang activity and crime in general, because for many young men, they feel it's the only escape. They see their parents and others in their community working honest jobs and still barely eeking out an existence and it's frustrating to see, much less imagine for your own future.

Maga dorks are certainly not going to acknowledge the US's role in destabilizing a lot of countries in central and south america (not that all of the migrants are exclusively from this hemisphere). I'm not saying Honduras would be a utopia were it not for the US's global economic policy, but it's a bit ironic when folks on the right call things (like Trump being prosecuted for being a crime boy) evidence of a banana republic.

I like your characterization of the problem of food prices being driven by shifting harvest seasons while maintaining sustainable margins for farmers because it implies many dimensions that touch on the issue, and therefore a number of different requirements to solve. 

Again, reducing this to ""no immigrants, no cheap food"", ignores downstream impacts like undermining fair wages for all, continued social issues from an underclass created by exploitation, and overall lack of humanitarian considerations.

Millions die from rising diseases emerging from lack of oversight, tariffs destroying the economy coupled with mass deportations, and any ""enemies within"" being hunted down by Republicans and their voters.

2) Biden sends people to arrest every Republican who has blatantly advocated for this and throws away the key. If Republicans are OK with Trump being a dictator then show them what one actually looks like. Deport Musk while we're at it, remove his government contracts, throw Trump to the wolves of the justice system, remove the SCOTUS and re-nominate all over again, and then hope when all is said and done whatever is left after can clean up the Republican party back to normal decency to run a re-election.

Anything extra-judicial simply won't fly, not because other countries aren't above that, but because they tend to only be supportive of it where it aligns with their own interests.

"Actually, I think this fatalism kind of fed into this. Our democracy is flawed, but it is a democracy and it was healthy enough to make us the strongest economy and military in the world. It was strong enough to get us the ACA, CHIPs act, improve itself so women and minorities could obtain the right to vote, and eventually gay people could get married. But it is far from perfect. SC justices are allowed to take bribes, we have an Electoral College system and a Senate designed to skew voting power to rural citizens (which coupled with the filibuster makes it stubbornly impossible for urban voters to have any meaningful voice), presidents have immunity now, money is considered free speech, and corporations people... there are a lot of fault lines for sure. But it is (was) a democracy.

AOC did something interesting. She asked people who voted for Trump at the top of the ticket and dems down ballot what their rationale was. The notion that ""we haven't had a democracy for some time now"" is exactly what jumped out in the answers I read. People feel powerless and felt like the system needed a disruption, and Trump had to be the answer. In this case, I fear that the fatalism was actually... fatal. Trump doesn't give the common person MORE power, he redistributes it to the already powerful.

Personally, I feel like the most important issue this whole time was widely ignored: the Supreme Court. It will take a lifetime to undo the damage once Trump appoints Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito's replacements. We saw them reverse protections for voter's rights, abortion, the ability of the Executive Branch to enact and oversee federal agencies, campaign finance reforms, and they made president's immune (but only for official acts, and they get to decide what's official on a case by case basis).

"Perhaps.  That case, in particular, is tricky. And finding teasingmout the truth is even more difficult.  My understanding is that the NIH funded research related to CoronaVirus for experiments by a group called ECOHEALTH. 

So this is where things get tricky. NiH claims that funding was provided to research potentially transferable coronaviruses found in wild bats to humans. 

Apparently, during this research, a strain of coronavirus was created, which showed GOF. As a result, the experiment was stopped due to government regulations surrounding GOF research.

So, the claim is that the NIH didn't fund GOF research. They funded other  research, which inadvertently led to GOF research. (Even if GOF was achieved, it is still debated in the scientific community, but let's say it was.) 

I guess it comes down to if you believe this telling of events. All of the research applications and updates from EcoHealth are available online now, thanks to freedom of information, so I encourage people to check that put and form their own opinions.

"I grew up in the 80s, and saw the changes that Reagan and Bush sr. made. My first vote was for Clinton in 92. In 2000, I remember Bush Jr vs Al Gore, and being told that this election was the most important one of our lifetime, and we needed to vote Gore to save the climate. I did, but thanks to SCOTUS shenanigans, Bush won. He won reelection, because we were still reeling from 9/11, but in 2008, I voted for Obama, who pulled us out of the recession Bush caused. This led to a repeat of good economic growth, for sure, but it also created Trump, and in 2016, it became clear that that election was ""the most important election of our lifetime."" I voted for Clinton, but Trump won. We all know the results. Then, in 2020, Trump decided to run again, with even more hateful rhetoric and we once again were told that the 2020 election was ""the most important election of our lifetime."" I remember feeling like someone had grabbed the wheel of the bus we were all in from Obama, and aimed us for the nearest cliff. I didn't like voting for Biden, but I felt like at least he'd pump the breaks, while another 4 years of Trump would drive us over the cliff entirely. Fortunately, Biden won.

But then, we got to 2024. The most important election of our lifetime, take 3. Trump, take 3. Trump tripled down on the hate, the rhetoric, the malice, the hyperbole and the blaming everyone else for everything he didn't like. He loudly and proudly telegraphed that he was going to persecute ""illegals"" and the LGBT community. He loudly and proudly announced that he was going to raise the cost of everything with tariffs on imported goods. And he happily said he was going to give tax cuts to his friends, while making the middle class pay more. Then, he announced other people that would be in his cabinet, like Kennedy, who wants to dismantle medical protections, remove the department of Education, and kill agencies that are meant to protect us like the EPA. Even though I was not at all happy to vote Biden again, I couldn't see any possible reason why anyone would vote for another 4 years of Trump.

Then, the debate happened. Biden did phenomenally poorly. It was obvious that Biden wasn't doing well. But then Trump said ""if you vote for me, you'll never have to vote again, we'll have it fixed."" That, combined with the attacks on the ""other"" made it clear we were repeating history and not in a great way. There was no way the American people would allow that to happen, right? Then Biden dropped out and Harris took over. At first, I felt that was a good, positive change, and that for the first time in a while, we had a chance to not only hit the brakes on the bus, but actually turn the bus onto a safer path. Instead, the country voted loudly in favor of driving it over the cliff. 

Not only that, but they voted for him in overwhelming numbers. And voted in a Republican senate, and likely a House. This will eventually lead to the already super conservative SCOTUS likely gaining 2 more seats from Trump, pushing the court even further right for at least 2 more decades. The court has already stripped the right of Bodily Autonomy, and has already threatened things like marriage equality and other personal rights. We are headed down a dark path. This time, I guess we'll see if this really was ""the most important election of our lifetime."" It almost certainly will be the last one I vote in. 

I see two paths forward. Either the rhetoric is correct, or it's not. Either Trump will put migrants into camps, outlaw LGBT rights, remove protections that keep Americans safe, encourage further genocide in Gaza and Ukraine, make the rich richer and everyone else poorer, and potentially set himself or his regime up so that there is no oppositional party to speak of, or he won't. If he does those things, in 4 years, there likely won't be another election - something on both sides have promised or warned us about over the past few months. If he doesn't do any of that, and the next 4 years are just him bumbling through his presidency playing golf and running out the clock on various court cases, and he doesn't follow through on the many many threats he's made, we'll likely have another election in 2028, where we'll likely be told it's the most important election of our lifetime. 

I'm tired. If Trump turns out to be the threat a lot of people thinks he is, I'll do my part in defending those who need defending, I'll criticize the things that need to be criticized and I'll continue to protest where it matters. But I don't think I'm ever going to vote again. Either Trump's not going to let me, or it really doesn't matter. Because I have no hope left for the system as it stands, this election killed that in me.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"According to Google sources, when the US gained its independence, the media consisted of newspapers printed by hand in operations that employed maybe two or three people, on a basic press that cost roughly one or two hundred dollars in 1785, which is equivalent to about $3000 to $6000 today. An average wage at about this time was $65 a year in the 1790s, with food and lodging perhaps, which works out to a bit more than $2000 today; so a press cost a few years' wages, comparable to buying a house. 

In other words, the publisher was a small businessman, requiring a large capital investment to get started, but one within the reach of many average people.

Furthermore, a paper seldom reached readers far beyond the limits of the town or city it was based in. There were no gigantic propaganda mouthpieces in the early Republic, and none would exist until about a century later.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Are these things happening in Gaza?

1. Yes. The daily death toll of Palestinians in Israel‚Äôs war on Gaza surpasses that of any other major conflict in the 21st century, while survivors remain at high risk due to hunger, diseases and cold, as well as ongoing Israeli bombardments. [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/gaza-daily-deaths-exceed-all-other-major-conflicts-in-21st-century-oxfam)

2. Yes. Oxfam said the crisis is further compounded by Israel‚Äôs restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza, where only 10 percent of weekly food aid that is needed gets in. This poses a serious risk of¬†[starvation](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/22/entire-gaza-at-risk-of-famine-as-fighting-rages-between-israel-hamas)¬†for those who survive the relentless bombardment, it said. [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/gaza-daily-deaths-exceed-all-other-major-conflicts-in-21st-century-oxfam)

3. Yes. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS) issued a briefing report today on the catastrophic conditions in Gaza, ongoing since 7 October 2023. In line with the elements of the crime of genocide, the report details how Israel has deliberately imposed conditions of life on Palestinians in Gaza that inevitably lead to their ‚Äúphysical destruction‚Äù. [Source](https://cihrs.org/i-didnt-know-if-the-baby-was-alive-or-dead/?lang=en)

4. Yes. According to the Ministry of Health in Gaza and United Nations Population Fund (UNPF) in the occupied Palestinian Territory (oPt), there are an estimated Ÿ•Ÿ†,Ÿ†Ÿ†Ÿ† pregnant women in shelters with no access to adequate food and proper healthcare. Around Ÿ•,Ÿ†Ÿ†Ÿ† women are due to give birth in the next month with more than Ÿ°Ÿ®Ÿ† giving birth every day.  Fifteen percent of them are likely to experience pregnancy or birth-related complications and need additional medical care that is not available.

5. Yes. The Israeli army has abducted Palestinian children and transferred them out of the Gaza Strip, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor said, as part of its genocide against Gazans that has been ongoing since 7 October. The rights group called on Israel to return the children to their parents.

"The guy that said ""If you vote for me, you won't have to ever vote again? We'll have it fixed up and you won't have to do it anymore""? 

The guy that said he was going to use the military to ""punish his enemies"" while implying that includes anyone who votes against him? 

In all fairness, he probably won't stop ME from voting, after all, I'm a cishet passing white male. My rights are pretty secure for the time being at least. But there's a lot of women, people of color, and LGBT people who have serious doubts about whether or not they can vote in the future. JD Vance has already said women shouldn't be allowed to vote, for example. 

Project 2025 wants to move responsibility for prosecuting election related offenses from the Civil Rights Division to the Criminal division to open the door to investigations and prosecute voters and election officials. They also want to use criminal prosecution to intimidate election workers and criminalize disputes. 

In short, Trump and the Heritage foundation wants to either: 

A. Remove voting from the picture altogether, or 

B. Make sure only the people that can vote are the ones that vote for them, and

C. Make it impossible for votes against him to be validated and legitimized. 

In short, he's not going to remove the right to vote from everyone, just the people that vote against him and pretend the rest don't exist. At least, that's what they've said. If they don't do that, well, I covered that in my post.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"This is why our founding fathers put the second amendment in place. To combat a dictatorship and strike down anything that isn‚Äôt democracy. 

Look, I think trump is a despicable human being who serves nobody but himself and those who are in his pockets. But the amount of doom and gloom is just unreal. 

The people voted, they spoke, they elected Trump. That is democracy. 

Furthermore, Trump didn‚Äôt win, the Democratic Party lost. 
They lost because for the last 3.5 years they‚Äôve said Biden was as sharp as a tack. The first debate proved that a blatant lie. He can‚Äôt even string together a coherent sentence. Who‚Äôs been running the country?

They lost because they ran a shit campaign based on identity politics instead of listening the the average American citizen who is struggling to put food on the table because the government is too busy helping everyone else EXCEPT its own citizens.

They lost because placed a candidate that polled at less than 3% support just like they screwed over Bernie in 2016. 

They lost because the same Democrats who have been running on the same BS for the last 3 cycles and refused to change so they might have a sliver of winning instead of taking the gloves off.

They lost because Democrats were too focused on fattening their wallets (looking at you Pelosi) and those of their donors.

Seriously, give me 3 things the democrats have done in the last 4 years that have benefitted someone who was a majority in America (gender, ethnicity, or religion). They were too busy pushing their far left agenda. 

Whatever happened to student loan forgiveness? Yes, I know some were forgiven (175bn). But when Biden launched his campaign, it was full forgiveness. Then it was $40k. Then it was $10k. My family never saw shit. 

What about inflation? What about the border? Lies, lies, and more lies. These things are crucial to the average American. And how are we supposed to have hope when the things that matter the most to us are being ignored or lied about?

I sincerely hope the Democrats get their shit together and listen to the people in their party in 2 years, and again in 2028. But just because Trump won doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the end of democracy. America has survived way worse than this historically, and we will survive the next 4 years.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Going back further in history: North Korea, South Korea during it's dictatorship, Spain, Germany - yes, Germany. Hitler got to power mostly democratically - his party won the federal elections, but there was a series of compromises to actually get him the chancellorship that were not fully democratic.

So basically what you‚Äôre saying is Reddit needs to die? Right?,2024_11_12,04_33_33

Hell no. As is right now our ISPs can collect and sell ALL of our information to anyone they want.

If you want to protect people from misinformation, criticial thinking skills are key, not dystopian solutions.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"I can see two main solutions to this problem. One is to require verification of any account that can post on a public forum, by tying the account itself to a physical email address, phone number, or both. That wouldn't completely prevent all issues, but it would help reduce the exponential proliferation of malicious accounts. There's a reason that you see the vast majority of obvious propaganda content coming out of accounts that aren't verified, and for example on Instagram, have zero posts or only propaganda posts.

The other solution, and I have no idea why this has not been implemented yet, is for advertisers to begin filing lawsuits against the social media companies that they buy ads from, because the ads are based on reach, and these advertisers are not getting their money's worth since they are advertising to a percentage of malicious accounts. In fact, I think these social media sites have a pretty good idea of how many malicious accounts are on the sites. They just aren't incentivized to remove them because it drives up ad revenue. Just look at he half-assed controls reddit has rolled out for controlling malicious accounts. There's nothing even mentioned about account verification.

And I agree with the last point, propaganda should not be protected speech, especially beyond a certain threshold. Already calling ""fire"" in a theater is disallowed. You can actually be prosecuted for that, especially if the resultant chaos causes injury. In that same way, protecting a politician's ability to egregiously lie about things like post-birth abortion and Hatians eating pets doesn't benefit anyone. That's the same level of calling ""fire"" on a national platform.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

The war in Gaza compared to the overwhelming majority of modern wars has the lowest Civilian:Combatant causality ratio which is increasingly impressive as Hamas attacks under civilian infrastructure maximizing civilian deaths. This one fact shows it is clear they‚Äôre working to minimize deaths.

Words mean something and when you misuse a term, you dilute it which is an injustice to actual genocides like the Uyghur genocide or the 6 million Jews who died in the holocaust.

Genocide must have intent.

* Israel conducting roof knocks, dropping millions of fliers prior to bombings, and calling civilians in Arabic to evacuate does not demonstrate intent.
* 2 million Palestinian Israelis (lgbt asylum seekers included) with equal rights living in Israel does not demonstrate intent

These few facts and your Iranian regime narrative fails apart.

Hamas murdering and raping thousands of Jews on 10/7 who have it in their charter to murder all Jews. Demonstrates they have genocidal intent and 10/7 was an act of genocide.

Palestinian deaths are worth money and outrage towards Israel so the terrorist org maximize them.

First, According to Israel, 1200 people were killed on 10/7. So ""thousands"" is a gross exaggeration. Second, you're right - Hamas does want to kill all Jews. And Israel's current regime wants to kill all Arabs. Just because the other side is wrong doesn't make the other side right.

Americans wait two years for this opportunity. Other countries don't even have a president, or the president is chosen through a different process. 

But also, having state and local offices on the same ballot? Absolutely nuts. How can you possibly run a meaningful state or local campaign when federal politics are sucking all the air out of the room? Other federations don't hold federal and state/local elections at the same time.

And finally, Americans just elect *way* more offices in general than basically anyone else, not to mention things like ballot measures.

You end up relying on the primary process to actually pick local officials, and those have even *less* turnout.

The one saving grace is the reason Musk is complaining about this: it's hard to centrally manage an influence campaign at scale across such a large number of simultaneous contests. So Musk put his finger heavily on the scales for the presidential election, but couldn't have nearly the same influence on all the other elections being held at the same time. If the elections were held separately, he could devote his attention to each one and that would give him far greater sway in how the country is run at every level.

"Yes. I agree with everything you just said. But that's the actual problem. 

>Short of decompiling the code actually installed in the machines along with a chain of integrity there's a lot of room for this to be possible

yes. this is the actual concern. I'm not dismissing the possibility out of hand at all. What I'm saying is that the whole ""IF/THEN and WHEN"" stuff is just pseudotechnical babble. 

Knowing that they actually do adjust the system clock and test for that is indeed something I'd like to know. Or even knowing if the machine itself even has a system clock with any concept of global time; I'd assume it does, but that's not actually a requirement for such a system. 

My point was more that the letter never addresses that as a possibility. I.e., you absolutely \*can\* test this if the machine has a system clock, while the whole IF/THEN and WHEN stuff makes it seem as if that's just not even a thing. Nor does it address that we don't actually even know for sure that this systems have such a clock, though this seems possibly easy to verify if the receipts that many (most? all?) of these machines generate provides a timestamp. 

* what's the actual process for testing the machines integrity?
* what's the actual process by which software is installed and updated?
* how is the candidates' data actually entered
* does the machine actual even have a system clock with the concept of world time
* can that clock be altered for testing? 
* is that clock altered for testing?

This is a big part of why I advocate for open source. Because then it's easy to answer those questions. And, of course, you avoid things that at the very least have problematic optics, like this: [https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/firm-close-ties-georgia-stir-concerns-about-voting-system-purchase/HVK4wcNsEAKO0Xa0ptLLKM/](https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/firm-close-ties-georgia-stir-concerns-about-voting-system-purchase/HVK4wcNsEAKO0Xa0ptLLKM/)",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Stein won in NC as governor, but how on earth did he not get literally 100% of the vote versus Robinson.

People split tickets. Always have. Always will. If anything, ticket splitting should give you faith in the process. 

If Casey somehow prevails - fingers crossed - Trump has very little margin for error in the Senate. And Murkowski and Collins have both voted against him numerous times in the past. They were never going to get a filibuster proof majority, but they also didn't leave themselves much wiggle room. 

The House may still flip Democratic. And even if it doesn't, the margin will be razor thin for a party that has been beset by infighting. They may quite literally not be able to lose a single vote.

**2024**

AZ presidential: 3,164,240. Senate: 3,127,227. Delta: 37K. Trump margin: 180K

WI presidential: 3,414,473. Senate: 3,386,788. Delta: 28K. Trump margin: 30K

MI presidential: 5,638,701. Senate: 5,567,193. Delta: 71K. Trump margin: 80K

PA presidential: 6,945,481. Senate: 6,876,603. Delta: 69K. Trump margin: 145K

NV presidential: 1,441,490. Senate: 1,422,838. Delta: 19K. Trump margin: 45K

NC & GA not applicable as no US senate race to compare to. Any in-depth investigation would need to compare all individual congressional district results. NC I did do a check on Governor's race:

NC presidential: 5,631,769. Governor: 5,545,311. Delta: 86K. Trump margin: 190K. This is perhaps to be expected given that Robinson was such a polarizing candidate and therefore is probably the worst comparison.

Georgia had no comparable statewide offices.

**2020**

To see if the underballlot thing is truly unusual, I compared to 2020:

Not all states are comparable, so I picked only those three states that did have statewide races to compare: AZ, MI, & NC

AZ presidential: 3,387,326. Senate: 3,355,317. Delta: 32K

MI presidential: 5,539,302. Senate: 5,479,708. Delta: 60K

NC presidential: 5,524,804. Senate: 5,474,952. Delta; 50K. Governor: 5,502,778. Delta: 22K.

**YoY Comparison**

AZ underballots: 2024 - 37K. 2020 - 32K

MI underballots: 2024 - 60K. 2020 - 71K.

I am not sure I see this as quite the smoking gun that post seems to. It's closest to be true in the blue wall. Especially Michigan and Wisconsin. PA more tighten up in this regard as more ballots come in, especially if Casey manages to come from behind. Is it weird to me that someone would vote for President but not Senate? Yes. But I am also hyper engaged. It certainly doesn't seem to be historically abnormal though.

"I rented a room off a woman who had married really young due to extreme religious pressure from her evangelical parents. She realized at 21, after her husband finally became physically abusive, after years of emotional abuse and her parents supported her abuser that she was in a terrible situation and one night while he was out packed up her car with everything she could fit and drove 2000 miles away. 

It was a couple of years after her divorce that I rented a room off her. I lived with her for a year and during this year I went through the worst breakup of my life. One night while I was sitting in the living room talking to her and some friends of ours about it and I was just absolutely beside myself about it all, and she said ‚Äúyou sound like you need breakup plates‚Äù  

Me ‚Äúbreak up plates????‚Äù 

One of the things she packed when she left was the dinnerware she got for her wedding but she hated eating off it so much after she left, she got a new set. I guess dinner was one of the times her ex-husband would be the biggest asshole. She told me she kept the old set to smash whenever she got angry. But not just smash randomly ‚Ä¶ but kind of more like as a ritual. And I have to tell you this was one of the most calm put together young women I‚Äôd ever seen. She was only 26 but she seemed much older than that. Not because of how she looked but because of how composed she was. 

She let me scream and cry and smash plates in her living room and I swear that did me more good in terms of my breakup and getting over my ex than anything else.

In Medicaid‚Äôs current financing framework, the volume ‚Äì rather than value ‚Äì of care patients receive drives spending.

With an unprecedented opportunity and incentive to share in federal savings, Tennessee will be able to earn the opportunity to reinvest those savings in programs that strengthen Medicaid and improve the health of all of their residents.
CMS is approving this demonstration for a period of 10 years to reduce administrative burden and allow the state sufficient time to evaluate its innovative approach. This approval, which includes robust monitoring and evaluation, empowers the state to better manage costs and target resources when delivering high-quality patient care for more than 1.4 million Tennesseans, many of whom continue to reel from the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

We can't afford to let that happen again if it's in our power. If Sotomayor stepping down would be best for the country, we should say so and hope she hears us.

There's no shame in retiring for the good of the country. That's what Biden is doing, and he's been widely lauded for it. That wouldn't take Sotomayor away from your nieces or from you as an inspiration; it would merely add to her legacy.

All that said, I agree with Bernie here. I don't see a plan right now that would ensure Biden would get to confirm a new liberal justice if Sotomayor stepped down, so it seems like the best bet is for Sotomayor to hold on as long as she can.

> Powell told then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that he would fight his removal if sought by the president, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump was upset the Fed was raising interest rates against his wishes.

> For Powell, the unsavory prospect of a legal showdown‚Äîone he might have to pay for out of his own pocket‚Äîwas imperative to preserve the ability of future Fed chairs to serve without the threat of being removed over a policy dispute. 

> Six years later, Trump is heading back to the White House and the dormant drama of his fraught relationship with Powell is back on display. When asked last week whether he would resign if asked to do so, Powell offered a one-word reply: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He gave the same answer when asked if the president had the authority to dismiss him.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Her anti-price gouging was some of her best received remarks and yet she dropped it because her campaign didn't want to run on it for some reason. I'm not going to make presumptions at this point but you can see where I'm going with this.  

In the end the Dems have the policies they need. They just need to lean into them. They need to care more about their base than those the special interests business groups fund the campaigns. I promise you if they do this they will get the votes they need and it won't matter about the Republicans saying stone election. It will be a landslide in the Dems favor but they have to lean into it and they can't be scared by business interest.  Those businesses need American customers (something that Republicans seem to be hell bent on making extinct).",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Tell me more about how you don‚Äôt understand how DEI works in federal agencies¬†,2024_11_12,04_33_33
"DEI and ""quotas"" are so willfully misrepresented by the media that most people are fucking idiots and don't know how they work, nor do they listen to people that are involved in the decisions.

There's no strict quota and it's not unqualified candidates being picked. DEI initiatives and ""quotas"" only serve to add a level of scrutiny to hiring decisions each quarter to make sure HR departments aren't passing over candidates due to historic racial and ethnic biases because the interviewee was queer, has a black name, etc. There's no ""we have to hire X number of Hispanic people this quarter."" It says ""we're hiring 100 people this quarter and 1000 people applied, we should be extra thorough to make sure HR isn't skipping over say A candidates that belong to an underrepresented minority because of implicit bias that makes them prone to hiring Chad Smith that was a B grade.""

Plenty of A grade Chad Smiths still get hired every quarter and companies that want to remain competitive aren't taking a B candidate over an A candidate. But historically, people in charge of hiring WOULD do that for many bias reasons and DEI initiatives basically are often just quarterly reviews to their hiring process or to semester enrollments.

Was a manager with Xfinity and used to be part of this process.

edit: In short, killing DEI initiatives just basically means removing the scrutiny and oversight to corporate and executive HR hiring decisions which actually means less qualified people will slip through more frequently once again due to historical documented biases in hiring which is typically bad for the company or agency.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"Diversity in workforces has a well established benefit to corporate bottom line.

The negotiator for Afghanistan looked confused. ‚ÄúWe can keep our mountain commandos?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù we replied. ‚ÄúIf you need them for defense then you can keep the mountain commandos. Do we have a deal?‚Äù

"This is exactly what I‚Äôd call bubble journalism‚Äînews that‚Äôs more about feeding people‚Äôs biases than actually informing them. Here‚Äôs why this kind of reporting is part of the problem:
	
1.	Over-the-Top Framing: The article makes Elon Musk sound like some kind of puppet master behind Trump‚Äôs potential administration, but there‚Äôs barely any detail to back that up. It‚Äôs all about hyping drama instead of explaining what‚Äôs actually going on.
	
2.	No Nuance: Instead of digging into the real questions‚Äîlike how much influence private citizens like Musk should have in government‚Äîit just focuses on the headline-grabbing personalities. It‚Äôs way more complicated than ‚ÄúMusk meddling in politics,‚Äù but they don‚Äôt really explore that.
	
3.	Divisive Vibes: The tone feels like it‚Äôs designed to make you either roll your eyes at Musk or cheer him on, depending on your bias. But where‚Äôs the actual balance? This kind of reporting just keeps people stuck in their bubbles.
	
4.	Missed Chance for Unity: This could‚Äôve been a moment to spark a serious conversation about the role of tech leaders in politics, but instead, it‚Äôs all surface-level drama. Imagine if the article asked, ‚ÄúShould innovators like Musk have this kind of influence, and what are the pros and cons?‚Äù That would‚Äôve actually been useful.

TL;DR: Articles like this don‚Äôt help‚Äîthey just stir the pot without giving people real facts or perspectives. We need reporting that challenges our biases and brings people together, not this bubble-feeding junk.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Whether it‚Äôs Tesla, SpaceX, or ùïè   they couldn‚Äôt operate at the level they do without efficiency being a key focus.
Theres also a big connection between efficiency and innovation. Efficiency often comes from finding new, creative ways to streamline processes, reduce waste, and get more done with less. Like Tesla‚Äôs advancements in battery tech and manufacturing didn‚Äôt just lower costs, they also improved performance and sustainability. Efficiency and innovation kind of go hand in hand in making things work better at scale. 
I also have faith that it's a new day for our country. Clearly, people wanted change, and maybe Elon can bring something fresh to the table. Sometimes, it takes a different perspective to spark new ideas and drive progress.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I respect what he has done at SpaceX and Tesla. Those are tough industries. The problem is that private industry is reductive. That‚Äôs why efficiency is so important. Everything you do is ultimately to make a profit for your shareholders. The public is both expansive and reactive. They have thousands of goals that comprise the providing for the general welfare of society. A water company provides water for money. The EPA tries to make sure our water sources don‚Äôt get polluted and that mission expands to meet the threats encountered in that mission. 

Government provides the platform private industry plays on. They aren‚Äôt the players or the teams. They are the league and the refs. 

Take drug development. If pharmaceutical companies were required to do all their first line research they would all go bankrupt. That‚Äôs why first line research is funded with public grants and done at research universities. They don‚Äôt need to ensure all research results in profit. The pharmaceutical companies wouldn‚Äôt exist without the NIH and the FDA. 

When I went to grad school I specialized in two very specific slivers of policy. You learn a lot of general stuff that helps you understand how government functions, but specialize after that. My point is what is efficiency means in government is not the same thing as in the private sector. The public and private sector are symbiotic but they are not similar.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"You‚Äôve made some really strong points, especially about the symbiotic relationship between the public and private sectors. I think the bigger issue is that our government is being run more like a for-profit entity,  but not for the benefit of the people. With all the spending, lobbying, kickbacks, and the revolving door where regulators end up working for the industries they were overseeing, it feels like those in power are prioritizing their own interests over the public good. In the end, people are fed up with this system, and I think someone like Elon, with an outside perspective and a business mindset, has the potential to shake things up. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs a fresh start",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"You know what I find curious.  Slate and The Atlantic both published articles this year about the state of reading education in the United States, articles that argued that a large number of college students even at elite universities are functionally illiterate, unable to understand a couple dozen pages of text, and neither article had any concrete plan on how to fix the problem.

See ""The Loss of Things I Took for Granted"" by Adam Kotsko in Slate, February 11, 2024.

See ""The Elite College Students Who Can't Read Books"" by Rose Horowitch in The Atlantic, October 1, 2024.

What is even more curious is that for the most part, this has gone under the radar of the alt-right, instead of what I would have expected, being the subject of multiple videos digging out even more elaborate sources over the past few decades.

Because I suspect these articles were intended to convey a different message -- that a generation or two of Americans are for the most part going to be useless to compete economically with the rest of the world in a rapidly changing technological landscape that will require massive and constant re-education.  I think the message was sent to the establishment that America's peak military power is now, that there is no next generation, no time, that it is either use it or lose it.

Education in the United States collapsed a long time ago, and no one has any idea how to fix it.  There is no hope to compete with other countries advancing ahead technologically.

"This. People don't realize how recent the anti- intellectual crusade on the right is. 

Eisenhower - my favorite president (would he recognize his party now?) - was a huge believer in public investment. The interstate system is the most obvious one. But he also pumped a ton of money into public education because that's where innovation happens - at good universities. 

The backlash to this started in the 60s because colleges were understandably the center of the swing towards individualism and also backlash to Vietnam. 

Ultimately, as with most of our current BS, the full on attack on public higher education came under Reagan, who has used Berkeley as a useful political foil during his time as governor because it was (and is) such a bastion of liberalism (of course, it's also a bastion of really smart people... Funny that...)

The 70s was when ""conservatives"" realized that education was making people liberal (again, shocking that learning stuff makes you think about stuff...) and so set out to dismantle access to higher education. Reagan really turbocharged this. As governor of CA, Reagan was in a perfect spot to exploit this because California's universities were so outwardly socially liberal. 

State colleges used to be essentially free. Because we - as a country - wanted to educate people for a variety of mostly noble reasons. But conservatives didn't like that because it made people less conservative. So rather than adapting and evolving, as always, they set out to just eliminate what they saw as the problem, which of course was not their own way of thinking. 

This is the origin of student loan debt. Lots of good articles about this but here's one from a similar reddit post. The intercept has a long article as well, but you have to sign up to read. 

Now, I think colleges in the US have a ton of problems not of the GOPs making. Multi-million dollar footballs programs, administration bloat, etc. That's on them. But the fundamental GOP war on higher education because college educated voters tend to vote Democratic is really on another level.

So the politically less powerful but economically powerful blue states are able to more effectively insulate themselves from national political harm, the other states are not. So while by nature of states rights, citizen tax bases etc this is actually fair, it will cause more division and rancor and further increase the economic divide which pushes sane politics driven by policy and reason further away.

One of the major problems in the United States is evidenced by the fact that this guy doesn't have a felony record.,2024_11_12,04_33_33
"The man who has emerged as¬†[the MAGA favourite to lead the Senate](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/11/trump-loyalists-face-battle-senators-rick-scott/)¬†during Donald Trump‚Äôs second administration presided over one of the biggest medical frauds in American history.

Like Mr Trump, Rick Scott is both incredibly wealthy and deeply familiar with legal troubles.

In 2003, his company, Columbia/HCA, once the biggest private hospital chain in the US, was forced to pay $1.7 billion after it was found to have defrauded Medicare.

Then the CEO, Mr Scott departed with a $10 million severance package. In a 2010 campaign ad, he said the company had ‚Äúmade mistakes‚Äù but that he took responsibility, pledging to ‚Äúlearn from it‚Äù.

Now a major political figure in his first term in office, Mr Scott has become¬†[one of Mr Trump‚Äôs most vigorous cheerleaders in the Senate](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/11/donald-trump-cabinet-picks-latest-news/)¬†and compares his legal issues to the four criminal cases against the president-elect.

Back in May, he likened his company‚Äôs $1.7 billion settlement ‚Äì then the largest medical fraud fine in US history ‚Äì to the legal cases against Mr Trump, calling them all ‚Äúpolitical persecution‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt happened to me,‚Äù he told Fox. ‚ÄúI fought Hillarycare, and guess what happened when I fought Hillarycare? Justice came after me and attacked me and my company.‚Äù

Mr Scott has been talked up by members of Mr Trump‚Äôs inner circle,¬†[including Elon Musk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/11/10/elon-musk-public-sector-revolution/), as the Senate‚Äôs next majority leader.

The GOP overturned the slim Democratic majority in the Senate at last Tuesday‚Äôs election, and looks on course for a congressional clean sweep, removing possible barriers to Mr Trump‚Äôs domestic agenda after Jan 20.

Already, Mr Trump has said he will reward loyalty in the Senate, calling on various senators vying for the leadership to agree to ‚Äúrecess appointments‚Äù, which would allow him to¬†[install allies in Cabinet posts](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/11/donald-trump-cabinet-picks-latest-news/)¬†without confirmation.

That idea is anathema to some constitutional traditionalists, who argue that any appointments must be confirmed in the usual way to allow the states to have their say on Mr Trump‚Äôs top team.

For others, the wheeze would allow Mr Trump to avoid time-consuming and controversial wrangling over his Cabinet and appoint allies who may not be popular with Republican colleagues.

One Capitol Hill source told The Telegraph that Mr Trump was concerned about the confirmation of Richard Grenell, who is in the running to be secretary of state, but is seen as unpopular among some senators.

The winning candidate to be majority leader will be chosen by a vote of senators, not Mr Trump, but the Republican presidential winner‚Äôs endorsement will make a significant difference to the shape of the race.

Other contenders include the current Senate minority whip, John Thune, and John Cornyn, a former deputy of¬†[Mitch McConnell, the outgoing GOP Senate leader.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/02/28/mitch-mcconnell-step-down-senate-republican-leader/)

"Left economic populism is the answer. The system hasn‚Äôt been working for working people. We know the establishment doesn‚Äôt care about us, and a lot of the working class sees Trump (whether it‚Äôs true or not) as a disruption to the establishment. 

To achieve anything, we have to build a broad coalition of working class people. Systemic racism and sexism are huge problems, but I think often identity politics is a tool of the capitalist class to divide the working class.

2) Information. The US has kneecapped its own education for decades now and has, in general, lost the information war. The republicans have FOX, democrats have nothing. They didn‚Äôt even ban TikTok and regulated Meta, X and so on.

"On election day I was a poll worker in a diverse district of a blue state. Ballots are private, but people who aren't sure how to physically vote will often show them to poll workers for help. I was absolutely gob smacked by how many visibly Muslim people and how many Hispanic immigrants voted for Trump. These weren't protest votes, people seemed genuinely excited to be voting for him.

Going into this election, I really thought abortion was going to be the wedge issue that won it for Harris.  On female centric corners of the internet, abortion has been a central issue since Roe fell.  But clearly that didn't happen.

This idea that Dems need to speak more to working class interests and present a better economic plan.  Trump is not presenting a coherent economic plan.  That isn't why people are voting for him.

I think inflation played a role.  The average voter doesn't understand tariffs or who passed COVID relief.  Trump's tax plan has always benefited the richest Americans.

I think immigration played a role, particularly in states that have seen an influx from the southern border.

I think a lot of people don't want a female president.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"It‚Äôs clear and was even clear before Bernie Sanders‚Äôs first run at office that working class Americans across all political spectrums are mad. Over worked under paid, watching millionaires and billionaires getting richer by the day and their PTO, pensions, benefits etc slowly slipping away. Then Covid hit and everything changed, it was no longer the same old cycle of corruption and inflation and then election cycle. Corporate greed kicked price gauging into next gear. And even when restrictions were lifted and we all went back to work they not only DIDN‚ÄôT take their foot off the gas they crept prices up more. Corporations were snatching up residential properties, housing and rent was unsustainable, interest rates were insane. Yet the economy is booming, Wall Street looks great, unemployment is at an all time low but you don‚Äôt see it, not if you make less then 100k hell maybe even a million. I own a business in Tallahassee my sales are down 11.2% for the entire year. Artists in my shop (some of which have been tattooing for 20 plus years) all say they‚Äôve never seen it so slow in their lives. Indicators of needs over wants indicators of where the general mindset of common Americans are at right now. Nervous and angry.

Then the 24 elections gear up and Biden makes a surprise move and steps down and Kamala comes in. I myself am surprised but also excited. I think she can turn it around I think she‚Äôs going to side step much of Bidens short comings (like age). She does well at rallies she does well campaigning she‚Äôs reaching many celebrities and her VP choice is a slam dunk (in my opinion). But then comes the debate with Trump, it‚Äôs her time to shine. She does fairly well but it‚Äôs missing something. I don‚Äôt hear anything about the price of food, of housing, of college, of gas. Trumps bumbling and dancing on stage for 40 mins but guess what else, he‚Äôs bringing up the price of eggs and bacon and gas prices. So much of what he says is brain dead and racist and borderline criminal but he‚Äôs saying this like the price of food and promising to fix it day one. So he‚Äôs essentially hitting two areas people are maddest about. The time it takes to change things and the outrageous price of living. If you were to equate inflation to wage ratio on a state to state level it would average about $16.50 a hour. Some states still have $7.80 hour. All while everything you can think of has risen in price. Trump tapped into that anger, fear and frustration of voters he would have never have, that were willing to look past who he was and what he‚Äôs done or would do in hearing the promise of immediate change financially. Do I believe it? Not a chance, he‚Äôs a liar and a grifting con artist but I also don‚Äôt live paycheck to paycheck check and I‚Äôm not blinded by desperation of that magnitude. Trump always had his cult of personality but he raked in new voters that are desperate and angry. The DNC had a chance in 08 with the Occupy Wall Street crowd they were ultimately disregarded, and again in ‚Äò16 with Bernie and we all know how shameful his disparagement of character was by the DNC and people close to him like Elizabeth Warren. Not giving him a fair shake caused a mass exodus of new and excited voters to the depression and hopelessness of them not trying to achieve big goals. Biden was a stop gap in 2020 but everything that has followed that has been so vanilla from Garland as AG to light touches with Ukraine. The DNC is far to use to playing it safe trying not to veer to far left or shakeup their corporate overlords. It‚Äôs high time they embrace working, middle and lower class Americans and adopt some real dynamic agendas to galvanize its base with younger, independent and undecided voters. I don‚Äôt see us losing democrats to this pitch. I only see us gaining more and drawing a hard line the GOP is forced to work with.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"Failing to prosecute the crimes of the right wing (including, but not just Trump) is the biggest single reason.

Even if democrats couldn't win it in 2024, at least we might have had reasonable Republicans like Liz Cheney running instead of MAGA extremists.

Every Republican in Congress who refused to accept the results of the 2020 election should have been expelled from office. Trump's crimes should have been thoroughly, vigorously investigated and prosecuted, putting him in prison as soon as possible, and then every lead followed to get all the co-conspirators, accomplices, and accessories. If that didn't somehow include 5/9ths of SCOTUS, Trump's nominees should have been voided, or the court expanded. 

Democrats play a cooperation game every single time they play, trying to find common ground and compromise. Republicans play hardball and often employ violent rhetoric targeting their opposition as traitors simply for disagreement. Democrats have a reasonable platform but they do not know how to play the game to win by any means possible. They want to win cleanly, and perversely they love to give their opponents every chance to get back in the game and win, like they don't really want to win unless they win an infinite series of contests where they have to win every time, and their opponents only have to win once.

2) Biden should have never gone for a second term even though he deserved it. Palosi has some blame in this as well imo. Now Kamala had to step in halfway through in the election, she had no preparation, no political identity or well thought out strategy she could play.

Everything that came before January 6th of 2021 was a political debate but AFTER that?

The Biden Administration should have had Donald Trump, several Supreme Court Justices, and whoever else in the halls of power that clearly supported overthrowing our Democracy up in front of a Military Tribunal.

FULL STOP

That wasn't ""politics"" that was a clear and present danger to our Nation.

I get that it wasn't comfortable or politically expedient but it was an existential crisis to our way of life.

You go over to a sub like r/QAnonCasualties and you read the devastating effects that this sick and subversive, dark Russian and who knows who else's money disinformation war has created in the lives of average American families.

Meanwhile every single day even the regular news is non stop screaming OH TRUMP HAS DONE THIS!! AND NOW HE HAS DONE THAT!! and unlike the imaginary billions of migrants coming to eat your pets or the kids being given surgeries in school IT WAS A VERY REAL AND VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM...which the Democratic leadership harped on constantly. THEY RAN ON IT IN 2020 and we elected Joe Biden to deal with it in 2020, and that was BEFORE J6, BEFORE the stolen documents, BEFORE the one thousand other things that have been nonstop reported all day every day for four years now.

I do not blame Harris but the Biden administration sat back and allowed an extremely dangerous seditious movement to grow like a cancer in our society and they put some LITTLE folks in prison sure. But did they arrest ANYONE with money and power and influence?? No.

And acting like oh well the courts just can't take care of it was like THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE THE MILITARY COURTS FOR. Exactly what. For moments in history that aren't appropriate for the civil courts.

Four years of Trump followed by four years of GUESS WHAT HE AND EVERYONE ELSE WITH MONEY AND POWER ARE ABOVE THE LAW and we're not going to actually do anything about it so it's up to you guys!! VOTE HARDER!! is where the ""Democrats went wrong"".

It's where the entire USA went wrong.

You don't get to stand behind the Presidential seal and tell us repeatedly how there's a growing populist Fascist movement in our Nation who have clearly conducted criminal acts but it's up to you little folks to take care of it.

You better vote like your lives depend on it because they do!! Was a HUGE part of Democratic messaging for the last four years.

I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT WE ELECTED Y'ALL FOR IN 2020. 

Everyone is AFRAID and EXHAUSTED and the current Administration took exactly ZERO actual steps to put down something that they were glad to point at constantly as a reason we better continue to elect them.

Ignoring every other issue that is going on in our Nation, when you are in charge of the Government and you sit back and tell us that you're cool with leaving it up to us little people, and we don't have the police or the courts or the Military or any of the many awesome powers we've invested in the Government to protect us from this kind of sh\*t, and then you tell us VOTE HARDER OR YOU GET MORE OF THE SAME but all you've offered for us voting harder already is NOTHING...

Yeah that's where the Democrats went wrong.

So I hope they're happy that they looked moderate enough and that they left us to do all the fighting when they had all the power and failed to have the balls to use it.

If this is the end of the USA as we know it then it's not because people on the left didn't try hard enough. It's that WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN LEFT TO FIGHT BILLIONAIRE AUTHORITARIANS AND RUSSIAN PSYOPS alone. We shouldn't have had four years of Trump is untouchable but here's why y'all should vote for us to do nothing about any of it AGAIN.

I am so angry. The Biden Administration completely FAILED US. It would have been rough to clap Trump in irons two months after they took office but it would have been what was right and while Americans still had the insurrection fresh in their minds. 

Instead they didn't want to do the hard thing but that's what a President is for. To make hard decisions that aren't popular when needed.

It's not just ""Democrats"" that are under the microscope here. A massive amount of people are realizing that the Government that we spend so much time and money worrying about when our Representatives are supposed to be getting paid to deal with these problems FOR us are utterly useless in the face of an actual threat.

We have been invaded and they sat back and watched it happen. And now God help us all.

You don't get to allow this sh\*t to just go on and do nothing about it when you had the power to stop it and then wonder gee why don't people believe in us any more?

Because we are HARRIED and EXHAUSTED and BROKEN is why. Because out here in the streets we're being threatened by extremists with violent intent is why. Because women had their rights stripped away and are dying but they did nothing to react to that decisively is why. Because Trump or anyone wealthy are clearly untouchable is why.

Because they did nothing except tell us to save ourselves, is why.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

You want to do forensics on this mess?

Ok.

You should have spent 2 months telling everyone exactly what was going to happen to the nation, to the world, if anyone voted Trump.  This isn't ""oh, Project 2025 is bad.""  No.  This is telling them exactly what events happen and exactly what results happen, and you sugar coat nothing.  You present their future of this nation, of their civil rights, of their freedoms, and of their livelihood.  And then you zoom out and show what the world is like with Trump in power, how Ukraine falls, how Putin takes over land and pushes for more, how militarization grows.  You show what happens to stability in the world as the US pulls out of NATO of the Paris Climate Treaty, and so on.  You zoom in back home to the US and show exactly what attacks on federal departments like the EPA, DOJ, FDA look like.  You show them environmental protections removed and damage to wildlife.  Then you show them their money.  You show them what broad spectrum tariffs look like, how many thousands of dollars more they have to pay, that second job they'll have to get to cover expenses.  Show them what defunding of social security looks like, what the end of medicare looks like.  Show them everything that can go wrong and go BAD for them.

Have them comprehend the level of RISK Trump is to this nation and its people.

This shouldn't have been a message of ""joy.""  Joy isn't the thing that was going to win this election.  The right side has been told for 10 years how bad Democrats are and how much stuff they messed up.  You have to compete against that.  You have to show that Trump is worse than that.  And you have to be graphic and relentless.  You had to make up for 10 years of media in 2 months.  You needed to make snuff films, just go hardcore and make it count.  Shock and awe.  You needed it to be viral and unavoidable.

And because we didn't succeed, the America public now gets to live it.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"Bernie Sanders has, IMO, the correct answer.

Harris was claiming victory over the economy using the usual metrics: inflation, unemployment, stock market.

Yet what people are _experiencing_ is sticker shock at everything. The price of a McDonald‚Äôs hamburger tripling. College and health care unaffordable. Housing costs skyrocketing. And during this time they might have seen a 3-5% bump in their own income, if they weren‚Äôt laid off. Most Americans living paycheck to paycheck while the fortunes of the rich increased 1,000 to 10,000%.

Harris only had one vague solution to this, and that was to ‚Äúcrack down on corporate price gouging‚Äù. That‚Äôs an entirely meaningless phrase and most Americans (stupid as we are!) know better.

The real culprits go hand in hand. Like the game _Monopoly_, unchecked capitalism gives such an advantage to the rich that eventually a very few people own _everything_. They can buy politicians and rewrite the rules to their own advantage. One of the first things they did was neuter the _only_ counterbalancing force we had: anti-trust, or the ability to stop mergers and price fixing, and forcibly preserve competition.

It is _shocking_ how many industries have consolidated down to just 2-4 players, and use all sorts of tricks to hide that fact.

So the problems are income inequality, and the ease with which money buys legislation. And unfortunately _nobody_ in the core Democratic Party has been able to resist the almighty dollar. We can‚Äôt even stop Nancy Pelosi from insider trading.

MAGA just lies about the cause. It‚Äôs those illegal immigrants taking all your jobs and housing! And those woke pedophiles turning your kids trans or gay, or those liberal colleges teaching things we don‚Äôt understand, and those pesky women deciding they want a life of their own instead of breeding the next generation of hard-working ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Americans! And the solutions are simple. Build the wall! Ban everything woke! Deport everyone who looks different or speaks a different language!

Most Americans fell for it.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"It's not rocket science. Working class people have fundamentally incompatible class interests with the capitalist class and the party leadership and donors choose imperialism and serving the interests of the capitalist class over serving the working class.

And there are tons of points where things went wrong, but two major ones were party bosses blocking out Henry Wallace in favor of Truman who dropped nukes on civilians and dragged us into the Korean War without congressional approval and the DLC/Third Way takeover of the party in the early '90s.

This election in particular a supermajority of independents opposed sending arms to Israel and polling showed that 34-39% of voters were more likely to vote for Harris in several swing states had she supported an arms embargo with only 5-7% less likely. And instead of complying she stood in Michigan and essentially told people she was going to keep massacring people's families because other people were still going to vote for her because they wanted cheaper groceries. Right wing liberal voters went wrong here in the primaries by nominating Biden, the delegates went wrong by choosing Harris, and Harris went wrong by refusing to support an arms embargo and instead choosing to lose. 

Nobody wants liberal-interventionist ghouls and genocidaires like Clinton and Harris. Nobody wants means-tested, trapezoid-program, tax-credit bullshit. Nobody wanted financial market deregulation and corporate trade deals. Nobody wants our insane military spending when cutting it to even inflation adjusted '90s levels frees up 325+ billion and just $20 billion of that can completely end homelessness in the U.S. Nobody wants our shitty healthcare system that causes 50k deaths and hundreds of thousands of medical related bankruptcies every year. Instead of actually doing most things working class people want they just keep moving right and rely on ""but Trump"" etc. making blue no matter who people continue to enable them to move right.

"The issue I have with this and similar analysis is that it doesn't work in the comparison to the opponent.    You can't simultaneously say that Harris didn't get votes because ""crack down on corporate price gouging"" is too vague without at least pointing out that her opponent never had a plan at all other than saying ""I'll fix it, trust me, it's going to be the greatest most beautiful economy you've ever seen.""      
  
Cracking down on corporate price gouging is at least a specific action you can take that's within the power of the presidency and doesn't rely on congress.   It's an actual thing that can be done and would help.     

  
I'd actually argue dems should just completely stop giving the actual plans, because they clearly don't matter.     It's a popularity contest, not a science fair.

The problem for the Democrats is that the country has complex problems with no simple solutions.

Harris jumped at something that sounded simple. Frustrated by $18 hamburgers? We‚Äôll ‚Äúcrack down‚Äù on that. Problem solved!

Except they can‚Äôt explain *how*, because few if any ways to do so actually exist. 

* Public companies are _required by law_ to maximize the short-term interests of shareholders. Customers made it clear that they would pay $18 for lunch. Pricing at less than this is ‚Äúleaving money on the table‚Äù, money that shareholders would very much like to have for themselves, and thanks to the SC they can sue to get it.

* Do we implement price controls? Aren‚Äôt those communist? And who decides what the price should be?

* Could we root out corporate money and influence to the point where Congress would finally be willing to bust up near-monopolies?  Didn‚Äôt think so.

Conservatives can promise straightforward solutions because they _make up fake problems_.  Your burger is $18 because of filthy illegal immigrants. A wall will keep ‚Äòem out! Simple! You‚Äôre broke or out of a job because of high taxes on the Job Creators! Easy fix: no more taxes on billionaires. Another problem solved! Easy!

I hear you... I read a comment by another Reddit user a few days ago, and I have to agree with their realization:

We all thought Trump lost the 2020 election because he sucked and people finally realized that. In truth, Trump likely lost in 2020 because *life* sucked (due to the pandemic) and Trump just happened to be President at the time.

What that means is if Clinton had won in 2016, she probably would have also lost in 2020. If Trump had let professionals deal with the pandemic and 400k more people survived, he probably would have *still* lost in 2020.

I'm beginning to wonder if reelection is only possible outside of any significant economic issues at the personal level.

I keep thinking that Democrats should start having a primary every election cycle, even if they have an incumbent. But primaries really aren't going to guarantee that you get a candidate that can appeal to low-information and low-propensity voters, soo... 

Since the economy is tied (rightly or wrongly) to the current administration, maybe something even more extreme: no incumbents. Any new Democrat candidate would need to make it clear that they will deal with the current economic issue(s) that people are facing.

This could allow voters to express their dissatisfaction with the current Democratic President, while still presenting them with a Democratic alternative that would push for *mostly* the same policies, but would give people the choice of something different when it comes to the biggest perceived pain point(s).

Edit: Of course, the success of that will depend on if people are blaming the current *person*, or the current *party*.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

I used to work in environmental policy.  NGO's would always come to us with polls saying some big majority like 76% of people believe in Clean Air.  

We would show them a poll we did that had questions like ""Do you trust the EPA?""  ""Do you feel gas prices are too high?""  ""Should the government seek to reduce the number of SUV's on the road?""

So when you looked at the two polls, you could see that while an overwhelming majority of people believe in cleaner air, but they would reject any way to feasibly carry out the plan in real life.

Like if you proposed a Universal Healthcare plan, someone will ask ""Hey does this cover abortions and does it mandate vaccines?""  Or ""So Trump and RFK jr. (or AOC) will be in charge of this?""

"Cue the Seymour meme. ""Was our campaign strategy out of touch? No, it's the voters who are wrong."" Being the lesser of two evils isn't a good campaign slogan. The New York Times isn't wrong when they say it's a hostage negotiation, not a political platform. 

12 million people didn't stay home for a protest vote. They had a historically low turnout because while political activists behave and vote strategically normal people only turn up to vote if it's exciting and self actualizing. They don't read policy papers and make detailed and informed decisions to pick the lesser of two evils, they get excited or they don't. They're never going to pick up a newspaper, and the Democrats are going to have to adapt to that.

And that means understanding that they cannot run on their opponents being worse than them, or on ideas that half the party sees as literally genocide. It's not enough that the informed turn out on election day. To be effective as activists we need to excite people who aren't going to read or watch anything. When they come in to the proverbial lunch room and see one table arguing with defeated looks and sunken eyes that it's necessary to back even a genocide to stop Trump, and the other talking about all the things they'll buy when Trump makes everyone rich, that's the table that they're going to join. Those are the people who are giving the people who hate politics an engaging experience. And for the half or so of voters who have never and will never do the reading, those two tables *are* the campaign and the election, and the Democrats ran an abysmal race.

Optics-wise, it seems Hamas really didn't have any goals or purpose other than anhiliation of Israel, and if the remaining prisoners were meant to be bargain chips, it seems the window to bring a peaceful conclusion with a return of prisoners probably ended 6 months ago.

"Islam is a religion. Do not conflate it with a race. Everywhere Islam is dominant and in control women live 2nd tier, infantilized lives in which dating is a family affair and being openly gay is bad. I see the left wing attachment is finally ending because more people are realizing this religion is extremely socially conservative and that it always made sense for them to align with evangelicals and other Christians, as they are in recent times. All three of the Abrahamic religions inherently lend themselves to extremely conservative views that love to war monger and I think it‚Äôs time to stop engaging in the idea that these ideas are conducive to happier world somehow. A lot of what holds humanity back is this shit being purveyed, and the fact that religious people are ALWAYS more willing to do what it takes to craft a world on their image than non. Interesting because they‚Äôre supposed to be the ones sure there is something after this world but whatever. Anyways as someone who grew up Muslim there is no racism against Muslims from liberals and left wing people. Those are the minority of left wing people that tell it like it is. They were never going to vote for Kamala and this is why:
1)if Kamala wins, trans and gays and recreational abortion are encouraged but Palestinians die.
2)if Trump wins? trans and gays and recreational abortion are discouraged but Palestinians die. *
As a demographic muslims who actually believe in the religion NEVER get to the point where people see themselves as Malaysian or American or German first, and I think from this point on the political alignment in terms of what parties they look to in the west will make more sense.

This is a moment in time in which a lot of people‚Äôs whose views I mostly agree with are just shocked because their ideas of how the world works and who believes what are delusional.

A lot more of them than there were thinkpieces and articles from activists suggesting boycotting her. As a whole, the way the party approached this conflict took over the campaign, at least in terms of what people were actually talking about surrounding Harris. And for the lunchroom conversations, that's leaving out all of her best selling points.

I think the mistake she made was that she didn't really try to thread the needle. Early on in her campaign, Gaza activists were investing a lot of hope in her already. She sought to distance herself from them, and ruled out any change in policy on Israel, effectively starting this conversation. It would have been better if instead, she'd said something like ""President Biden believes that the war is winding down, and should be over before I take office. If that doesn't happen, then when I take office, we will evaluate what went wrong, and how we help to get everyone through this. I promise that I will be absolutely committed to ensuring a future that will be safe for Israelis, safe for Palestinians, and safe for their supporters at home.""

You can have one group of people excited for Trump because he's going to ban porn while another group of people were excited that he's going to make video games sexy again, and he had both at the same time. Kamala briefly had this on Gaza, where human rights activists were investing their hopes in her for change, while steadfast Israel backers saw her Jewish family as a sign of safety and support. But she squandered it by telling the Gaza activists she was ruling out any change on Israel policy, when she could have just said that she hopes Biden can bring the conflict to an end and she's ready to evaluate where it went wrong if he fails to do so.

He also promised transformational economic change. His approach might be ruinous, but he told people that he understood they're poor now, and that he has an answer. Harris told them they weren't poor, or that if they were it wasn't because of the economy. She didn't let them invest hopes of economic improvement into her. She didn't even acknowledge there was a problem.

But even more broadly they talk to their activists differently. Trump tells his activists that they're special, exceptional, wonderful people, better than everyone else. The Democrats, in general, have a very high standard, where as a voter you are at best adequate and never heroic. For the Democrats, most of the nation is inadequate, and for the Republicans, you can be anyone and if you're one of them you're a part of the solution. Harris needed to tell people that voting for her made them heroic and special people. Instead, she told them that not voting for her would make them inadequate or bad.

Overall, it really has been a failure of the Democrats to acknowledge that they need to run a much more internally positive campaign that tells people that voting for them is something to brag about, not a minimum bar to reach.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"No it wasn‚Äôt lol. It was a conquest certainly, but most of the inhabitants were not displaced, they assimilated to the now dominant culture-which is the normal way cultures spread. Certainly not a positive thing, but not exceptional and certainly not settler colonialism. The Romans were responsible for displacing Jewish people who lived in the region into the diaspora, not the Arabs-if anything, incidents of anti semitism lessened under Islamic rule, as Byzantium would often massacre the Jewish population whenever they retook the region in their constant warring with the Sassanids, and this did not continue under Arabic rule. 

A huge portion of the Jewish population had already been driven out by the Romans at the time of Islamic conquest, and a large chunk of the population at the time of the Islamic conquest were Samaritans, Chalcedonian and Miaphysite Christian‚Äôs, ect. By the seventh century, Jews were a minority of the population. Palestinians are largely the descendants of these people and the Jews who remained in the region after the Roman ethnic cleansing, who adopted Arabic culture after converting to Islam. Not settler colonialism, and much further back in time than what Israel is currently doing and has done. Even then, Jewish people continued to remain in Palestine up until 1948, although not without incidents of anti semitic violence, much like in Europe or other nations at the time.

"Here's the actual definition from the UN [Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide](https://www.un.org/en/genocide-prevention/definition)

Definition
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
Article II

In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

Killing members of the group;
Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

She was the 2nd most liberal senator just behind Bernie. Her 2020 campaign was very far left. People didn't believe that she was a moderate - just 6% of the country thought she was too conservative.

" Democrats got so tired of losing because the working Joe thought they were too soft on POC and other members of marginalized communities, that they chased the Republicans over the cliff to the right. It worked. Clinton was extremely  popular and elected twice in spite of impeachment. 

Of course he then gave us NAFTA, Republicans wouldn't fund the services to help decimated communities, and the great discontent began. 

 (To  be fair -  Clinton also raised taxes and gave us a surplus  , which Bush ~~spent~~ pissed away on hunting for nonexistent WMD.) 

The great discontent brought us Trump. 

And it can be said that trump was elected by a majority not because Harris wasn't focused on the working class enough, but because she wasn't right wing anti immigrant working class enough. 

This, along with being tough on crime , was the type of policy that gave Clinton the Whitehouse - 

>Everyone remembers that in 1986, President Ronald Reagan passed an ‚Äúamnesty‚Äù law. But what most people don‚Äôt know is that in 1996 ‚Äî fresh off the heels of signing welfare reform, and two years after signing the ‚Äúcrime bill‚Äù ‚Äî President Bill Clinton signed a bill that overhauled immigration enforcement in the US and laid the groundwork for the massive deportation machine that exists today.

>Both welfare reform and the crime bills Clinton signed have been relitigated during a contentious Democratic primary, but the 1996 immigration bill ‚Äî the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act ‚Äî hasn‚Äôt.

>There was no single provision of the 1996 law that was as dramatic as the 1986 ‚Äúamnesty‚Äù law, signed by President Reagan, which is why he gets credit for the last major immigration reform. But the ‚Äò96 law essentially invented immigration enforcement as we know it today ‚Äî where deportation is a constant and plausible threat to millions of immigrants.

>It got easier to deport people.¬†Immigrants convicted of crimes weren‚Äôt the only ones stripped of the ability to argue their case before a judge before getting deported. So did anyone apprehended within 100 miles of the border. And IIRIRA required the government to hold more immigrants in detention before deporting them ‚Äî making it substantially harder for them to get lawyers.

>The change to the law was so drastic that after a high-profile deportation of an immigrant over a minor crime led to public outcry, Republican members of Congress ‚Äî including the lead author of IIRIRA ‚Äî wrote the Clinton administration asking them to back down.

Only it turned out he was brought to America as a small child, having been born in Mexico, and his father got a fake birth certificate for him to use here. He had no idea that he's not American and never was. As of last year he was fighting deportation, both of himself and his son whose citizenship was revoked after the fake birth certificate came to light.

"Let's work backwards from the vote results and the messaging that led to it.

The evocative imagery of ""hundreds of thousands of criminals,"" though untrue, was powerful enough to trigger hysteria on a national level and across demographical borders. 

Urban flight, through coordinated price fixing (White Pages), and by Wall St firms propping up AirBnB and buying entire surburban residences, made historically white communties see more brown people over the years. 

BLM marches and subsequent riot damages helped reinforce pre-existing bigotry and prejudice to non-white people. Trump gassing them (painted as criminals) for a photo-op with a bible, reinforced their idea in him as a righteous champion who would be tough on crime (peaceful protesters.)

Remember, that demonstration outside the whitehouse was peaceful until police clad in riot gear started pushing them out by force. Barr's DOJ was responsible, yet also likely saved the protesters from live fire, which Trump was fine doing.

The movement was inspired by no-knock warrants, excessive force by police, unjust actions without good reason or suspicion, and their coverup attempts all over by rogue union leaders.

Right-wing influencers, especially the younger ones, like to hand out fake money to the homeless, and giddly film themselves admitting it. This gets laughs, but when most of the targets are black, then it becomes that black people are to be mocked.

Didn't George Flyodd use a bad $20? Or was it selling loose cigarettes? Or did he jaywalk? Or did he fight back? Man, it doesn't even matter. It's justified action against a criminal and its funny when they scream. Right? You know you know a type like that. They proudly meme it all over their socials.

They laugh when a non-white person is found hanging from a tree, gunned down over a bag of skittles, killed for taking a jog, shot at the door. 4chan mentality is a becoming the norm of the right-wing youth. There's a pressure to conform.

Lack of discipline, lack of empathy, or open hostility from parents drives this immoral superiority complex. Lack of access to quality educators, or time-proven approaches toward education, and attacks by the state to side with such unruly and diseductated and disrespectful parents, impacts the ability to intervene in such matters as would otherwise lead to better decision-making and critical thinking and less to social pressures from their peers.

We move to good vs evil. No longer reliant on great minds who challenge conventional religious order, those who teach and provide access to information without bias are treated as evil. God must be the intervention, God makes right, follow God and can I get an Amen for a holy civil war? The demons are on the left, they are in your communities, they are violent and dangerous, they are indoctrinating your youth.

They are eating your cats, dogs, and pets, right? Let's justify what we need to because only evil people do that, and Trump is the only one exposing it. To obey Trump is righteous. To obey Trump is to bring order. The world is full of darkness and only Trump can save us. To obey Trump is to bring us closer to prophecy..... We are drunk on our own delusions.

There are so many factors driving our conditions that it becomes tough to explain what you are seeing with your own eyes, but it all comes together.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"I remember reading about a southern state - I think Alabama,  that decided to come down hard on all immigrants, not just criminals  - traffic stops on anyone who looked Hispanic, raids, etc.  and of course the immigrants left to pick crops in a different state. 

Well, agribusiness went crazy - their profits were rotting in the fields. But you have to be highly motivated to work in brutal conditions. Locals weren't interested . The state tried prison labor, but that didn't pan out. 

So they quietly rescinded their anti immigrant policy and invited the immigrants back in.

I don't know the answer to this.  Vance says we need to stop letting all immigrants in. He ranted against the legally  hired Haitian workers in his own state. ( They're eating cats and dogs!)  He says they are keeping wages low, keeping housing prices high. I don't get this one - houses are pretty much built by immigrant labor where I live.  As to low wages, Vance invested in a greenhouse in appalachia where the work was so brutal and the wages so low, Americans refused to work there. They brought in migrants. 

People have gotten used to cheap products, cheap food. Is it morally alright to use immigrants that suffer low wages and abuse?   If not,  are we ok with paying 10$ for a tomato? Who knows how much for a roof.  Att hired all immigrants to lay cable in my neighborhood. The people doing lawn maintenance are all immigrants.

So there is a process. Biden and Democrats along with Republicans created a bipartisan bill to deal with the asylum problem. Get rid of the backlog, shut off the spigot when it isn't being processed quickly enough, add more border guards, judges.

This created a climate of hostility that may have forced tens of thousands of immigrants to flee‚Äîand it may also have done real damage to the state‚Äôs economy.

"The biggest problem is asylum. Too many cases, not enough resources. You are right, it wouldn't take much to improve the situation.

If Biden had resources for asylum and the law to turn off the flow it would have helped immensely. And Republicans didn't like that idea during an election.

"Heh. All the tech and finance companies have lawyers that skirt the edge, play the game. 

We hear companies complain that they can't find enough workers that know how to do the job, then American techs get laid off but in order to get their severance they have to train their replacements who make less money.

Many foreign Workers get rotated in and out so it doesn't look like they are permanent. 

Disney and IBM didn't do enough to hide the game - Disney for employees training foreigners and IBM  got caught laying people off and hiring back as contractors with no benefits. The IBM example has nothing to do with foreigners, but shows how corps play with the rules. 

Since then they have gotten smarter. 

What is bizarre is that trump and Vance go so hard at fruit and vegetable pickers who work at grueling jobs for little pay  - but never mention the tech workers who replace great paying jobs with great benefits. 


Tata and Infosys are two of the third parties... There are others. 

Ironically instead of training lower paid junior programmers, tech companies now train the H1B employees who are rotated and have inside knowledge of US tech - which they then go off and replicate. 

This is just how it is - for now. 

But soon enough, AI will take most jobs - and contrary to what people may tell you , it will not create enough jobs to make up for it.

">However, Sir Keir‚Äôs plan could be seen by Mr Trump as an attempt to undermine US foreign policy, which could antagonise him and threaten the relationship

Maybe the toadying little shits at the Torygraph could show at least a tiny bit of patriotism and acknowledge that we are not quite the 51st state yet and our government actually has the right to make foreign policy decisions independent of the United States? (~~Then again, the Barclay brothers who own that rag are so patriotic that they are Monaco residents because they would rather not pay taxes in the UK~~ - see correction below). 

Support for Ukraine has been UK government policy since the invasion, both under the Conservatives and Labour. It is absolutely in our own interest to stand by our Ukrainian friends because that war is practically on our doorstep and Ukrainian refugees are already here. They will stay here if they don't have a country to go back to if, as is likely, Trump will offer the Donbas to Putin as part of his ""peace"" proposal. To think that Putin's territorial ambitions will be over once he's overrun Ukraine is incredibly naive - something that we of all countries should be acutely aware of (cue Chamberlain proudly declaring [Peace for our Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_for_our_time)). It is also absolutely in our national interest to work as closely as possible with our European allies as Trump has [repeatedly threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/how-trump-destabilised-montenegro-with-a-few-words) that under his leadership the US will be too cowardly to stand by its Article 5 obligations. 

If Trump pursues his America First agenda without any regard to the responsibilities of the global superpower status that NATO has helped the US build over the last 80 years, we need to immediately scramble now and acknowledge the *geographical* reality that the safety and security of our country can only be supported by building strong security ties with our European neighbours. That means that we'll have to stop being Washington's poodle and actually put Britain first as well. And that can only happen in a European context. It's not us doing the undermining of our friendship with America.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"""Plots.""

No bias in that wording, hm?

How about ""Starmer tries to prevent Trump backstabbing Ukraine"" as a more factual headline?",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"**From The Telegraph:** 

  
Sir Keir Starmer and¬†[Emmanuel Macron](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/11/07/trump-speaks-to-macron-before-starmer/)¬†are expected to plot a last-ditch attempt to thwart Donald Trump‚Äôs efforts to scale back US support for Ukraine.

The British and French leaders will discuss on Monday whether Joe Biden, the US president, can be persuaded to give Ukraine¬†[permission to fire Storm Shadow missiles](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/09/30/biden-allow-storm-shadows-fired-russia-helsinki-commission/)¬†deep into Russia, according to UK Government insiders.

The Telegraph has been told there are hopes in London that Mr Biden will finally give the approval Kyiv has sought for months in an attempt to secure his foreign policy legacy.

Talks will take place in Paris as Sir Keir becomes the first UK leader to attend the Armistice Day ceremony in the city since Winston Churchill in 1944.

The knock-on impact of the impending Trump presidency¬†[on the Middle East](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/10/whisper-it-but-the-middle-east-may-be-on-the-brink-of-peace/)¬†and the possibility of a trade war with Europe are also expected to be discussed.

The efforts come as world leaders attempt to work out how drastically Mr Trump, who won the US election last week, intends to¬†[change US policy on Ukraine](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/11/07/donald-trump-ukraine-peace-plan-british-troops-buffer-zone/).

Mr Trump talked about¬†[ending the Ukraine war on ‚Äúday one‚Äù](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-election-donald-trump-kamala-harris-november-5-issues/)¬†throughout his presidential campaign, leading to fears he will force Kyiv to accept land lost to Russia.

A senior Whitehall source said: ‚ÄúWe are very keen to make sure we can make the most of the time between now and Jan 20 \[when Mr Trump becomes US president\] and not just put everything on hold until the next administration.‚Äù

Another source said Mr Biden was expected to ‚Äúturn on the taps‚Äù by handing over more financial aid owed to Kyiv in the weeks before he leaves the White House.

Fears surrounding Mr Trump‚Äôs plans for Ukraine were fuelled over the weekend with news that Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley, two pro-Ukraine former cabinet members in his first administration, would not be given positions this time round.

Donald Trump Jr, the president-elect‚Äôs son, said there is¬†[no place in his father‚Äôs administration for ‚Äúwar hawks‚Äù](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/11/10/donald-trump-jr-mocks-zelensky-allowance-run-out/), in another sign a stark change in approach could be coming.

In a post on Instagram on Saturday, he posted a video appearing to mock Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukraine‚Äôs president, over losing his American ‚Äúallowance‚Äù when his father returns to the White House.

In the clip, Mr Zelensky looks unhappy alongside Mr Trump with the caption: ‚ÄúPOV: You‚Äôre 38 days from losing your allowance.‚Äù

* David Cameron (Tory, 2010-2016) Won on pinning the 2008 global recession on Labour, decided to quit after calling the Brexit vote.

* Theresa May (Tory, 2016-2019) Won an election but completely destroyed her majority in the process causing her to sign a confidence & supply agreement with a further right-wing party, effectively lame duck PM as parliament could not agree on a deal on how to negotiate Brexit thanks to the stupid 'red lines' the other party put in place to continue confidence in her. Eventually quit when she realised the date of withdrawal was coming up and nothing was in place.

* Boris Johnson (Tory, 2019-2022) Won election on 'Get Brexit Done', immediately pulled UK out of EU within a month, then Covid hit, became extremely popular until it turned out he was deciding to host sex parties in Downing Street while telling people to stay at home and not socialise which caused half his party staffers quit on him.

* Liz Truss (Tory, 2022) Elected by 100,000 Tory party members, immediately crashed economy by calling for tax cuts for the rich, removed after 50 days in office.

* Rishi Sunak (Tory, 2022-2024) Another lame duck as was stuck in a hard place of trying to turn the economy around while half his party decide to copy Trump's immigration and 'destroy the libs' playbook. Decided to run an election campaign that was so bad he ended up leaving the D-Day memorial in France early to do an interview about how he was so poor growing up he didn't have cable TV.

"> it is the US that provides a majority of the funds for NATO

No, you don't. In terms of direct funding for the running of NATO, [the US provides 15%](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm#direct), the exact same amount as Germany. If you mean the US spends a bigger part of its GDP on its own military than everyone else, that's also wrong. The US spends 3.37%, whereas Poland spends 4.12% and Estonia 3.43%, with the overwhelming majority of member countries spending above the agreed 2% goal. I suppose you mean the US spends more in *absolute numbers* on its military than all the other NATO members combined. While that's true, all of that is money that the US government spends *within the United States* on American-produced weaponry and equipment as well as *its own* active personnel and veterans. None of that money goes to other countries, and crucially, only a tiny, *tiny* fraction of that is earmarked for the defence of Europe and Canada. In 2023, the budget allocated to the European Deterrence Initiative that funds the US European Command was 4 billion dollars, less than half a percent of your trillion dollar heavy defence budget. If you want to reduce your military spending, that's completely up to you guys. Good luck with that, but not standing by your European allies won't even make a dent. The military-industrial complex in the US is a major part of the economy and provides jobs across the country, often in areas that don't otherwise have much industry going, very often in deep red states that will fight tooth and nail if you close down those factories. Every billion dollars that you take away from your defence budget is a billion dollars missing from the American GDP and ultimately, American workers. 

Secondly, I appreciate that your view of our 75-year-old defensive alliance is entirely transactional and you don't care about soppy concepts such as loyalty, integrity or honour, but there are good transactional reasons not to throw your toys out of the cot as well. See, nobody is forcing you to spend that much money if you don't want (again, you're spending it on yourself, not anyone else), but if you reduce your global footprint that also means the rest of us will have to look to alternative means to finance our security needs and we'll obviously not buy American weapons systems in that case. That means we'll have to divert larger proportions of our GDPs towards our domestic arms industry than now, which is money that could have otherwise been spent on all kinds of American goods and services. And frankly, if we do end up as the victim of Russian aggression because the US unilaterally decides to pull out of NATO that will also have an effect on your export industry. Europe buys half a trillion dollars worth of goods from the US every year. That won't be happening if we're kind of busy dodging Russian bombs. 

Nobody, absolutely nobody, says that America shouldn't look after its citizens and veterans. The world famously already pities you for not having a decent social net for your citizens. And it'd be great if you finally diverted some money from your armed forces to a decent universal healthcare system or care for your sick or elderly or to alleviate childhood poverty. Frankly, that should have happened well before you bought shit like your *11th aircraft carrier*. You don't need those and never did - the rest of the world combined only has 9. But it doesn't need to be a black-or-white affair, nor does it have to happen in one go while we're in the middle of a shooting war. Any sensible country would sit down with the rest of us and would work out a transition plan. You'd think that being the only country that ever invoked Article 5 would mean something to the United States, or the thousands of NATO personnel that fought and died alongside American servicemen and women through the last 8 decades. But even if none of that matters, pulling out of NATO (or more worryingly. making your commitment dependent on how your President feels on any given day) is irresponsible and ultimately counterproductive for the United States as well.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

>‚ÄúThe US election result is a setback for global climate action, but the Paris agreement has proven resilient and is stronger than any single country‚Äôs policies,‚Äù said Laurence Tubiana, chief executive of the European Climate Foundation and a key architect of the Paris deal.

>‚ÄúThe context today is very different to 2016,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere is powerful economic momentum behind the global transition, which the US has led and gained from, but now risks forfeiting. The devastating toll of recent hurricanes was a grim reminder that all Americans are affected by worsening climate change.‚Äù

>Much like after the previous withdrawal, cities and state within the US committed to climate action will try to fill the void of federal indifference, acting as de facto representatives at global summits and even engaging with other countries on how to cut emissions.

>‚ÄúNo matter what Trump may say, the shift to clean energy is unstoppable and our country is not turning back,‚Äù said Gina McCarthy, former climate adviser to Biden and co-chair of the America Is All In coalition of climate-concerned states and cities.

>‚ÄúOur coalition is bigger, more bipartisan, better organized, and fully prepared to deliver climate solutions, boost local economies and drive climate ambition,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe cannot and will not let Trump stand in the way of giving our kids and grandkids the freedom to grow up in safer and healthier communities.‚Äù

>Domestically, environmental groups have said they will attempt to rally Democrats, as well as some Republicans, to oppose Trump‚Äôs tearing down of climate policies, which is anticipated to include major cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and weakened pollution rules for coal plants, cars and fossil fuel drilling. ‚ÄúPresident Trump will face a bipartisan wall of opposition if he attempts to rip away clean energy incentives now,‚Äù said Dan Lashof, director of the World Resources Institute.

>However, Trump‚Äôs election victory has been a deeply sobering one for those concerned about the climate crisis. The issue was barely championed by Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, with polling showing that voters considered it a minor priority despite scientists‚Äô warnings of record-breaking temperatures and two devastating, heat-fueled hurricanes that smashed into the south-east US just a few weeks before election day.

>‚ÄúThis should be a wake-up call ‚Äì the climate movement urgently needs more political power because the climate crisis is moving infinitely faster than our politics right now,‚Äù said Nathaniel Stinnett, founder of the Environmental Voter Project, which sought to turn out the vote of environmentalists in the US.

"I‚Äôd agree that the democrats are disconnected, but I‚Äôd also argue the people are disconnected from the problems they‚Äôre actually facing. Climate and economic disasters can both be blamed on the 1% that perpetuate consumption based economies for the sake of continued growth. People are worried about the price of bread, the people that are making bread expensive are the same people that have industrialized food production. The solution is de-industrialization, the end of consumption based economies.¬†People working office jobs providing nothing tangible thinking they deserve to have enough to survive are perpetuating the same systemic problems that the elite are. They may not be perpetuating them to the same extremes, but they still are perpetuating them.¬†

"It‚Äôs definitely easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism. Personally I think it‚Äôs possible, but I know it‚Äôs an optimistic mindset. I think Trump‚Äôs second term could actually get us closer to the end of capitalism than another Democrat term would have. If we attribute the mass waves of unionization and social organization across the country in recent years to Trump‚Äôs disastrous first term, and the complete economic meltdown we‚Äôre expecting in his second term actually does happen, then I think populist systems could emerge out of necessity. People don‚Äôt want to have to worry about basic necessities, and the way to make that happen is by taking control of the means to produce those necessities. Our ability to get those necessities through the means we currently do is likely going to collapse. It‚Äôs definitely an optimistic approach in a way. It relies on the suffering of hundreds of millions of people, and a resulting solidarity among those people. A result of division and hate is possibly more likely, it‚Äôll be up to those of us that actually understand leftist ideology to spread solidarity in our communities.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

If you are a person who has a belief that abortion is a very important issue, but not the entirety of the reason to vote, (AKA the vast majority of people on both sides of the argument) then you could very easily recognize that the worst or best thing that Trump did in regards to abortion was allow it to be decided by state law, which in some cases actually expanded the access to abortion while others curtailing(There has not been a single state as far as I am aware of that has a total abortion ban). So when the media and people rail against Trump saying that he will bring about a national abortion ban, that flies in the face of reality and perhaps people recognized that issue was being blown up out of proportion.

Long story short; people were pissed when Dobbs happened. It occurred ~4 months before the midterm election. Now, it‚Äôs been over two years.

Then, if you compound on top of that that the fact that he plans to deport 15 million illegal immigrants, we would be stretching our labor capacity so thin that there really won‚Äôt be anyone to work these jobs. So we‚Äôve tariffed other countries, causing massive inflation on all imported goods, and we wouldn‚Äôt even be able to produce them in the country like he wants to because there‚Äôs no one to work the jobs.

Then, most rapes are by known perpetrators. And reporting is complicated or impossible. 

On top of that, EVERYONE knows that consequences are more likely for the victim in reporting. Social consequences. And ongoing threat when the perpetrator is not held accountable. 

This has been reinforced by what people have seen. I had a similar experience to Christine Blasey Ford in high school around the same time, except it resulted in rape. I was 16 and only told my best friend. I was so ashamed and overwhelmed that I just wanted to forget. If that motherfucker were to be nominated for the Supreme Court, would I speak up?

"Aside from reducing misogyny + tacit acceptance of rape myths (like the idea that if a woman takes too long to come forward it means anything about her credibility, no offense). and better training for ppl that handle rape cases blah blah...

There's literally only one thing I can think of that would help and it involves overhaul of legalities around rape.

There need to be more opportunities for women to bring forward civil cases (similar to the one Trump was accused and held liable in) OR burden of proof for sex crimes specifically needs to be modeled more after burden of proof in civil suits even in criminal courts.

Between how and where rape usually takes place, and these misogynist rape myths permeating brains on top of it, burden of proof is currently almost impossible to meet for rapes 99.9% of the time.

Even in cases where there is what you would think is pretty hard proof, like a rape kit showing significant genital damage or cctv footage showing a woman practically being dragged out of a bar unconscious by a man she never met before, people STILL do rationale yoga to come up with ""doubts"" that in the end prevent prosecution.  It's honestly pretty insane.

Whereas if you judge based on overwhelming likelihood, it can be really obvious that the rape happened.

Like just because it's theoretically possible that a 16 year old girl would choose to lose her virginity insanely drunk in a muddy ditch with a stranger in such a rough manner her vag got torn up doesn't mean it's in any way LIKELY. Be ACTUALLY reasonable.

But you'll have this man's lawyers digging through her [fanfic.com](http://fanfic.com) account for smut she read when she was 14 that ""proves"" to half-male jurors or some conservative judge that she had always wanted dirty nasty kinky sex with a 30 year old man or something. And it will fly. And not only will she not get justice, her entire sexual history will have been dredged up while she was made fun of and retraumatized.

Atm of course women are usually extremely hesitant to come forward in any significant way. Because they know, and if they try are repeatedly told very dismissively by police and lawyers and everyone else, that it probably will not go to court and if it does nothing will happen.

Also even people she trusts will question her and make her feel like shit, and his buddies and family will tar her and support him unquestioningly, it won't hurt him at all.

And then if she does come out with it publicly and they are unable to provide proof of something that happened with no witnesses (because of course that's how rape usually occurs), she might catch a false accusation charge herself on top of everything. Even though TRUE accusations don't usually seem to harm men at all and we now have plenty of examples of women getting hit with false accusation accusations only for it to be proven TRUE that they were raped much later. Like make it make sense

But people will balk at legalities somehow being revised in this way, because oh no, lower burden of proof, what if some man gets falsely held liable or convicted?

Well that's unfortunately a possibility with all crimes and no one wants that to happen. But doing the utmost to avoid it with sexual assault DOES hamper almost all rape cases to the point of making prosecution like climbing Mt. Everest and does NOT prevent collateral damage to innocent people from how rape is handled by the system.  There is already a LOT of collateral damage being done by the way our legal system handles rape.

It's just that right now that damage is carried pretty much entirely by victims and potential victims, who are later targeted by rapists that have gotten away with rape time and time and time again when they should have been held accountable.  And I at least am tired enough of this arrangement that I am fine with potential-accused (lbr most often men) sharing some of this burden of potential collateral.

I had a man attempt to rape me once and after (yes, I was still in contact with him, it took me a while to process what he had done as it often does for women) he told me that he once raped another woman before me and when she tried to tell on him so many people supported him it made his business grow.

And now a man that is a KNOWN rapist, who bragged about sexual assault and IIRC has the most assault accusations of any president before him (so he has probably done it plenty of times let's be real) is President of the US.

It really fucking empowers them.  One way or another we NEED to find ways to hold these men accountable in some way even if it requires seriously rethinking how we handle sexual assault by law. In this case the law found him liable and even still it doesn't seem to fucking matter.  It's depressing,",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"And? What's your point? trump has raped multiple women and girls. He surrounds himself with sexual harassers and rapist. He's pro rape.

That was evident in the 2022 midterm elections when Republican Charles Herbster faced allegations of sexual violence from 8 women when he ran in Nebraska's GOP gubernatorial primary. Trump already backed Herbster in the primary but went all-in after the women told their story, dramatically escalating his support for Herbster.

>This points to why misogynists and abusers seek each other out, beyond just having shared interests. They prop each other up in the gross belief that it's really cool to be a man who hurts women. In defending each other, they create a politically powerful solidarity. Untold numbers of men who have gone MAGA have done so mainly because they hate women.

"Again, considering rape accusations (especially if they're legally proven false and sometimes even if not see: Trump presidency) do not seem to hold much serious consequence for the accused, I don't think false accusations should hold the same penalty as rape.  In the current legal system I think people should be cautious about false (or ""false""/unprovable) accusations holding ANY penalty. Like I think if someone wants to bring a charge of false accusations against someone accusing them of rape, simply not having enough evidence to prosecute the rape should not be seen as evidence of lying. You should have to prove the deceitfulness and intent of the accusation separately. Otherwise the risk of being falsely accused of falsely accusing because you tried to get your rape prosecuted but couldn't clear the burden of proof hurdle, just prevents women coming forward.

And even just conceptually, slander is definitely bad, but violating someone's body sexually is like orders of magnitude worse and the impacts it has psychologically are usually so much worse. So idk what penalty is most common for slander, but it should probably be something like that, and burden of proof for false accusations should also depend on burden of proof for rape.

I don't really care what happens to rapists as far as extremity of the punishment, like I don't care if they do die or whatever, but I am skeptical of like automatic death penalty sentences etc. ONLY because I think it might incentivize rapists to get rid of the evidence after.  Like I think it might be unintentionally counterproductive and result in people being killed. Also, the more severe the penalty the more cautious I suspect people will even be to acknowledge that what the accused did legally WAS rape, which still = no justice for victims. At this point even consistent legal acknowledgement that that's what happened would be a step forward for victims.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"Donald Trump‚Äôs new ‚Äúborder tsar‚Äù told Democrat governors¬†to ‚Äúget the hell out of the way‚Äù so he could carry out mass deportations in their states.

Tom Homan, a former head of immigration and customs enforcement, pledged to override states who try to block Mr Trump‚Äôs plans for the¬†[largest deportation programme in US history](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/11/10/the-woman-at-the-top-of-donald-trump-mass-deportation-list/).

Several Democratic governors, including California‚Äôs Gavin Newsom and New York‚Äôs Kathy Hochul, have indicated that they were drawing up plans to do so.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen some of these Democratic governors say they‚Äôre going to stand in the way. They‚Äôre going to make it hard for us,‚Äù Mr Homan told Fox News on Monday.

‚ÄúA suggestion: if you‚Äôre not going to help us, get the hell out of the way for we‚Äôre going to do it.

‚ÄúSo, if we can‚Äôt get assistance from New York City, we may have to double the number of agents we send to New York City because we‚Äôre going to do the job. We‚Äôre going to do the job without you or with you.‚Äù

Mr Homan, the architect of Mr Trump‚Äôs controversial policy of separating migrant children from their families, suggested that local police should help with deportations. ‚ÄúLaw enforcement should work with law enforcement,‚Äù he said.

It comes after NBC News reported last month that Mr Trump was considering pressuring local law enforcement to join in immigration raids by threatening to withhold grants.

Mr Homan said the administration would maintain asylum seekers‚Äô rights to see a judge but the court‚Äôs final decision needed to be enforced.

‚ÄúIf the judge‚Äôs order doesn‚Äôt mean anything, then shut down immigration court, take the Border Patrol off the border if there‚Äôs no consequences violating the laws of this country,‚Äù he said.

It came as Mr Trump, the president-elect, also named his long-time adviser Stephen Miller, an immigration hard-liner, to be the deputy chief of policy in his new administration.

Mr Miller was a senior adviser in Mr Trump‚Äôs first term and has been a central figure in many of his policy decisions, particularly on immigration, including Mr Trump‚Äôs move to separate thousands of immigrant families as a deterrence program in 2018.

Mr Miller has also helped craft many of Mr Trump‚Äôs hard-line speeches, and was often the public face of those policies during Mr Trump‚Äôs first term in office and during his campaigns.

Since leaving the White House, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal, an organisation of former Trump advisers fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as freedom of speech and religion and national security.

"Why do you think all the ""cheap labor"" is going to leave the country?

I think the reality is far worse than people are imagining.

So Trump and his pack of scumbags are very eager to start arresting people on suspicion of being in the country illegally. However, you'll notice that they're *not* talking about expanding the number of judges and other officials necessary to take someone who has been arrested and actually release them in another country.

This is a problem, because while Trump may be able to convince the average US racist that any brown skinned Spanish speaker is ""Mexican"", the nation of Mexico isn't going to accept millions of people unless the US can actually prove they are Mexican citizens and follow at least some processes for moving them. And unless the Mexican government cooperates to at least some extent,  anyone Trump deports can just come back. So there would have to be some mutually acceptable practice to do this -- you simply can't deport millions of people to a country that isn't willing to accept them.

So people waiting to be deported are going to pile up much faster than people actually end up getting deported. Which will lead to prisons, camps, and people who spend long but indeterminate amounts of time in a state where they haven't really been ""convicted"" of anything, but aren't free to go anywhere.

So in practice, I think this ""deportation"" plan is mostly going to be an ""expansion of permanent mass incarceration"" plan...which appears to be what private prison companies are figuring as well, considering how happy they are.

And the US already uses prison labor for all kinds of things -- manufacturing, call centers, fighting fires, etc.

Also, Trump is talking about establishing crippling tariffs, so companies won't want to import stuff made via cheap slave labor overseas.

So how about if they just create a pool of cheap slave labor right here in the US?

And *that* is where I'm afraid this is going. This isn't going to actually lead to mass deportation so much as the functional enslavement of millions more people as prison laborers, who will then continue to do the jobs undocumented immigrants have been doing but for even *less*.

Think about it -- a company currently employing undocumented immigrants for a small amount of money can simply turn them in to the Trump administration, earn a Presidential attaboy, and then simply rent the laborer of the immigrants they turned in for even *less* than they were paying them before. It's win-win for everyone except the immigrants, who become slaves.

And that is going to become the absolute worst kind of problem: a constant stream of horrors inflicted on people by a powerful and organized system incentived to keep inflicting and worsening those horrors.

And the worst part is that this isn't some new thing -- it is merely a continuation of what has been happening for our entire lives, except they are adding some more people to the list. This system can easily be expanded and adjusted in incremental, organized ways by regular people who don't agree with it but whose career success involves doing it well enough to earn a bonus and promotion.

Fascism has been described as ""colonialism brought home"", and that is exactly what this is: the US is colonizing itself (or rather, continuing to colonize itself, because once again: none of this stuff is actually new, so much as just a continuation and expansion of existing horrors we grew used to).",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"personally I think we should slowly make them citizens so we can start taxing them more then just the standard Social Security, and medicare stuff.

Mass deportations won't ever happen because it's just too expensive and we don't have the manpower, also it would have to be coordinated with so many other countries that have to accept these people back. The cost is estimated to be 800 billion to 1 trillion over the course of a decade and that doesn't take into account new arrivals that would happen in that decade.

and yes the minimum wage should also be raised because it's been $7.25/hr since 2009. Large companies abuse that low wage and rely on the government to keep their workers alive by providing supplemental income. Walmart workers got more than 6 billion in supplemental income every year.

MAYBE hurting his base will make him reconsider. I doubt it, but the only way this stops is if the people who picked him get mad enough to demand it. So, yeah, I hope they get hurt first.

She's a high profile public figure who probably knows better than to take unnecessary risks.

As for those on the Hill calling for her retirement, again, considering that Manchin plain out refused to approve several judges who lacked Republican support earlier this year, it's hard not to question their wisdom and judgement on this, seeing that the the entire thing would have to rely on not only Manchin but Sinema as well.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Because we share this country with an entire group of people who want a fundamentally different country from what the other side ones.

Objectively:

Democrats want to essentially continue the new deal era America into the 21st century; and even maybe expand it. Republicans want to end the new deal era and bring us back to where America was before that; they want to overturn the 20th century.

Its literally a divide over whether the last 120 years were a good or bad thing; and I don't see how we can continue to even share a country with people who believe the era of social progress, economic justice and political integrity was a *bad thing*.

It is fundamental disagreements of human rights, the fundamental role of government in public life and the foundational culture of the nation we are talking about here, not tax policy or traffic laws.

"The plan to create a national university is straight out of Hungary:

>MCC‚Äôs university-level program is even more intensive. Since 2020, the Collegium has purchased and renovated a number of hotels in the country‚Äôs major university towns, which provide free residential accommodation, supplementary education, and paid work opportunities to six hundred students enrolled in external, degree-granting universities. In addition to their main academic studies, students attend lectures, seminars, and debates at MCC facilities; during holidays, they travel together for recreational trips, during which they learn about Hungarian history. Finally, as students approach graduation, MCC administrators connect them with internships and jobs at think tanks, academic institutions, private companies, government agencies, and foreign-exchange programs.

>The intention of MCC is to create a new national elite. During my time in Hungary, I spoke at the MCC campuses in Budapest and Debrecen. As one MCC administrator explained, the government was making a massive, multibillion-dollar bet that it could train thousands of students to develop deep civic loyalties to the country and eventually take over its political, economic, and social institutions. The students I met at MCC were impressive: fluent in multiple foreign languages, studying a wide variety of liberal and technical fields, and optimistic about Hungary‚Äôs future. Most, but not all, were conservative; every one of them described the MCC program as open to spirited political and philosophical debate. And, they told me, the MCC centers also served as an informal marriage market.

2. Trump fast forwards the coarse Biden put them on and forces Ukraine to officially cede the territory they have lost and cannot hope to regain militarily. If they are lucky they might get security guarantees from NATO, or maybe just the US.

If Obergefell goes, gay marriage will be instantly outlawed in something like 28 states.

The Respect for Marriage Act requires states to recognize valid marriages from other states. But it does not require all states to allow gay marriage and, in fact, most currently have laws on the books explicitly outlawing it, which will activate the moment Obergefell goes.

This leads us to a situation where gay couples have to travel to other states to get married, but their marriages must be recognized at home.

"He said he would seriously consider appointing Supreme Court justices who would overturn Obergerfell (the case the granted gay marriage rights nationwide).¬†

This would do the same thing as overturning Roe v. Wade, effectively bumping the question back to the states.¬†

Colorado and California (for example) had standing amendments in their constitutions that banned gay marriage - if they didn‚Äôt just vote internally to revoke them, and this court case was overturned it would resume these bans.¬†

There is a federal law that protects the recognition of marriage across state lines - I have not heard of any talk about repealing that law, but I‚Äôm worried about the rhetoric I‚Äôm hearing from republican lawmakers about sending even interracial marriage back to the states to decide on.¬†

It would not be surprising if a national ban was a goal in some of their minds.¬†

"Marriage laws and protections vary state to state even in normal marriages.

Example ‚Äú One area in which the states differ is in the area of marital property. Most states, the District of Columbia, and the territories are common-law property states. That is to say, each spouse owns his or her personal property outright, and the spouses may own property together‚Äîeither jointly (with right of survivorship) or as tenants in common (without right of survivorship)‚Äîbut the marriage does not create a marital community, hence there is no marital property. These states are known as separate property states. In a minority of states, however, a marriage creates a marital community, that is a legal entity in which each spouse has a vested interest and that is marital property separate and apart from each spouse‚Äôs individual property interests. The community property states are: Arizona, California, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.‚Äù

"[McCormick is currently trying to challenge 15k to 20k provisional ballots.](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4980694-mccormick-lawsuits-provisional-ballots-pennsylvania/) Casey could still very well flip the race, but it looks like it's heading into a recount territory unless McCormick maintains his >0,5% lead with incoming ballots.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"Very much so. I did ballot curing phone banking to help voters in PA understand how to cast provisional ballots. Some counties in PA mailed out ballots \*on the Friday before Election Day.\* Yes, you read that correctly.

* Ballots in PA **must be received by 8pm on Election Day**
* Many voters (tens of thousands at least) did not have their ballots **mailed to them** (no, not received, **not even mailed**) until Friday, Nov 1. 

Now, with that said, there's no evidence yet that this altered the outcome of any race. But it is critical to understand why provisional ballots were necessary and why they absolutely must be allowed to be counted.

As far as Erie, the data to date shows that Erie shifted \*less\* to Trump than most other counties in PA. So far, it shows a 0.5% shift from 2020, far less than many counties - even very blue ones. So while the situation in Erie is a problem, it's not necessarily one that indicates Democrats suffered greater disenfranchisement.

That's why it's just such a show of bad faith on McCormick's part to demand Casey concede. Voters of all party affiliation were screwed over by these mishaps. Just count the damn ballots. Concession is not legally binding regardless. The result will be whatever it is when all ballots are done being counted. Just let that process happen. And stop trying to disenfranchise voters, many of who \*might\* be members of your own party. 

The hypocrisy here is what really gets me, as always.  If they actually cared about election integrity, this would be the place to actually show that. But, of course, they do not. They only care about winning. When fraud is a useful narrative to contest a loss, they use it. When actually counting votes might imperil their victory, they do not want it.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

"\> I did ballot curing phone banking to help voters in PA understand how to cast provisional ballots

Thank you. I grew up in PA. Your efforts are much appreciated.

I agree with all this completely.

The only thing I will add, as I mentioned above, is that mail-in ballots requested statewide favored dems by more than 20 points. So even if the state shifted to Trump overall, there's reason to expect provisional ballots to heavily favor dems in dem-leaning areas, and as we know, reason to expect the ballots to be counted last to come from larger, more dem leaning districts.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Activists in¬†[states like Idaho](https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/08/15/idaho-group-files-four-initiative-proposals-to-restore-abortion-access-to-ban-state/)¬†have floated similar ideas too.

"> Homan notoriously spearheaded one of the most brutal anti-immigration campaigns during Trump‚Äôs first term: a ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy toward migrants, which meant separating thousands of migrant children from their parents. **This cruel act, meant to deter more migrants from arriving at the southern border, resulted in thousands of children being put in shelters, living inside cages.**  

And they did such a half-assed job of tracking the kids  that over two thousand kids still haven't been reunited with their families. 

Imagine wanting hurt kids in the the hope that this act of abject cruelty would dissuade other would-be migrants.

"Key parts:

Amidst their handwringing, Democrats are asking themselves, ‚ÄúHow did our country elect Donald Trump?‚Äù **But the question they should be asking is, ‚ÄúWhy did so many people reject the Democratic Party?‚Äù**

**There appears to be zero self-reflection by the Democratic Party that could otherwise educate them on why their message ‚Äî or their messenger ‚Äî did not resonate with voters.**

A course-correction cannot be made unless Democrats begin listening to voters and changing the way they talk to them.

**We marched well into 2024 and we were all told not to believe what we saw with our eyes or heard with our ears ‚Äî that Biden was up for the challenge and he would prevail.**

This might have been a good time to check in with Democratic voters to see what they wanted (i.e. to listen).¬†**However, in a clear subversion of democracy, the party anointed Vice President Kamala Harris without ever given voters a chance to speak.**

Compounding the failure to listen, the party struggled talking to voters. **Biden calling Trump supporters garbage did little to correct the ongoing narrative that the Democratic Party talks down to people.**

**Demonizing anyone who supports Trump is not an effective strategy**. These attacks have a ripple effect that extend beyond the red hats and affect the opinions of those who would otherwise be on the fence but feel indirectly attacked because their brother or sister supports Trump.

**Many people I know who voted for Trump last week did so because they felt insulted by Democratic Party rhetoric.** They have told me they did not like being called racist or sexist and ultimately ‚Äî justifiably or not ‚Äî they resented Harris for it. One person told me their disapproval for her was enough to make up for the embarrassment of voting for Trump. 

**Speaking to large swaths of the country as if they are school children is perhaps one of the biggest faults of the national party at this moment.**

The party‚Äôs unwillingness to listen to voters and the tone and words used to talk at them led to an election outcome that was as predictable as it was preventable.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Democrats are scarily close to missing the point of this election yet again. They missed it in 2016, they missed it in 2020 when they only won because of how badly Trump fucked up with COVID, and they‚Äôre missing it again now. People want to blow up the system, and replace it with something that will benefit them instead of the rich and powerful. They are sick of a government that is subservient to the industries it is supposed to regulate. They are sick of the profit above all else mentality of businesses. They are sick of owning nothing and being told to be happy with it. 

So they voted for the people who said they were going to blow up the system. The problem is the republicans are going to further break it in favor of the moneyed interests, not in our interests.

"You can look at Joe Rogan's trajectory to see how the party fucking failed catastrophically for that demographic. 

Joe Rogan endorsed Bernie Sanders in 2016. But it wasn't just that Sanders lost, it was that an entire party-led narrative originated around people only voting for Sanders because of ""misogyny"". 

Now that may have existed. But I was a huge Sanders supporter. And I would love and welcome a woman President. I would be excited for that. But Hillary Clinton was a status-quo war hawk. She was not a good candidate, and she was run as the party-preferred candidate out of the expectation that it was her time. 

In fact, my favorite debate moment in history is when Clinton was debating Sanders, and Clinton was asked about supporting the Iraq war. And she said ""that passed congress 99 to 1!""

And Sanders came in and said, ""Yeah - I WAS THE ONE!""

I mean that says it all. We all know the Iraq war was fucked. And Democrats were right fucking there with the rest of them. We watched them fail to prevent this horrible clusterfuck, never apologize or reconcile with it, and prop up a candidate who lead the charge as their nominee. 

And then sideline and turn their propaganda apparatus around on the singular voice who was nearly always on the right side of history.

While Bernie didn't generate enough enthusiasm to win the primary, he represented a significant chunk of party enthusiasm especially among younger voters who were tired of hearing their grandparents' party refuse to change its messaging. 

Joe Rogan began a hard-right drift around the same time the party egregiously mishandled its influx of new, interested voters. 

Now, nine years later, those people have watched politics descend into a clusterfucking clown show, and they have watched Democrats run *exclusively* on ""stopping Trump"" without articulating what they're goig to do once he's gone that isn't simply *milder* tax cuts for the wealthy and more war in the Middle East.

Harris was extended an invite to speak on Joe Rogan, and declined. 

Now, personally *I* think Rogan is a useless fucking meathead, but you know who doesn't? Tens of millions of voters. These are not the ""abortion is the devil"" people. These are mostly younger people who feel disillusioend with politics and are so desperate for companionship and humna contact in a world we have fucking broken, that they want to listen to this guy prattle on about nonsense like every conspiracy theorist gym rat. 

Harris should have taken that. But she's not good at three-hour talk sessions that will require a deviation from her messaging - *and that's what people don't like*. 

Harris knows the genocide in Gaza is wrong. But she can't say that, because the DNC is trying to appeal to people who think genocide is bad, while still taking all the donations and funds from people who are A-OK with it. 

Now clearly a vote for Trump is far worse for people living in Gaza. That's basic logical fact. But people do not make decisions on logic. They make it on emotions, and you cna't be a mature political party and pretend otherwise.

Do you know what emotion is proven to be the *most* painful, the most difficult to endure for a human being? 

Betrayal. 

And listen to me. People. Make. Decisions. Based. On. Emotion. They just fucking do. 

So when Harris speaks out of both sides of her mouth on Gaza, her *supporters* are going to feel that lie. They're going to feel it, and be hurt by it. 

And they're going to want to hurt back. By not voting. 

You can scream all you'd like that they're just making things worse for Gazans by installing Trump - but people don't fucking work like that. 

If Democrats' entire messaging is about how horrible and monstrous Donald Trump is - and people feel betrayed by Democrats - what do you think they're going to try and do to hurt the people they feel betrayed them? 

This is all so painfully obvious and it is a lesson that Democrats have failed and failed and failed and failed to ever learn.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

It would have happened regardless of whether it was Biden or Trump from 2020 to 2024, because that is how coming out of a pandemic and global macro economics works.

Harris had a plan to bring the cost of housing down, it was a multiple pronged approach. 1) give first time home buyers a $25k tax credit. 2) build 3 million new homes (thus increasing supply, one of the biggest reasons for housing prices being high). 3) she was going to go after corporate landlords, and generally (any company that price gouges, such as food companies) which would help the renter market. Trump had nothing of actual plans for housing outside of saying ‚ÄúI can fix it‚Äù. Yet voters just didn‚Äôt give two shits to be educated on the topic. 

The cost of used cars was initially due to Covid and the impact it had on semiconductor production, namely because Taiwan was locked down, production cratered. No semiconductors means fewer new cars, to which people turn to used cars. After they opened up again used cars remained high due to price gouging. Which again, Harris had a plan to deal with price gouging. People not understanding why/how it started or that Harris addressed it is on their own ignorance.

Right. But... who initially chose to run again in 2024, rather than stepping down as they promised to do at the end of their first term? Who chose to put the VP of the current administration up as the sole candidate for the 2024 race?

It is an impossible situation that the Democrats purposefully and intentionally created for themselves. Every step of the way was their intentional, purposeful choice.

Because they didn't anticipate how mad voters would be because they are not accustomed to listening to voters, and never really have been.

And so they figure, if they're lying about everything else, maybe they're lying abut how bad Trump is.

"> You don't think labeling large swaths of people as racist, bigot, incel, misogynist is harmful rhetoric?

People keep commenting this as if it is automatically true but never back it up with actual evidence.  Please show how a mainstream cohort of Dems called a ""large swath of people"" those terms.  Otherwise, it's just feelings.  And feelings can be valid, but, if they are divorced from reality or created by propaganda, people are going to point that out.  

Yes, I think at least 1 voter in 75 million was swayed by this idea.  Trying to claim that Dems are calling people all of those things has been a core part of right-wing propaganda for a decade now.  But that doesn't mean it is true.  However, I do think that someone hearing every day from the right that the left are saying mean things will start to shift low info voters over time.  But, again, that doesn't mean it's an objective truth.

And, if shitting on people on social media actually swayed people massively, we'd have seen more Harris voters because there was at least as much social media content trying to shit on Dems.  There's clear studies about right-wing content getting outsize amplification by algorithms, and we have seen a massive amount of right-wing content be incredibly hateful (see I can just make claims too) so that must mean right-wing hate is everywhere.  So why don't more people vote accordingly?",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"Yes, I completely agree that Trump gets the ""tear it all down"" vote, but that is different than the ""Dems are mean to us"" vote.  The policies that made the average American frustrated with the current economy (meaning the past 10 years) is not something specific to the Dem party.  They're arguably more to do with neoliberalism and the GOP's economic policies, anti-union behavior, deregulation, etc than anything else.  It's hard not to see that the Trump protest vote represents a very real unhappiness that is also incredibly misguided.  But, when you are unhappy and someone is offering easy answers in tandem with non-stop misinformation about how everything is shit right now, it seems like the easy answer so people get sucked in.

Hillary ran on converting coal country to jobs of the future and they rejected her.  I know that was not an easy sell for them since it felt like an end to their history, but that doesn't mean they were correct in their choice.  Government is how the working class combines their power to overcome the negative forces of the wealthiest actors within a capitalistic system.  The irony of them electing a billionaire grifter who promises to tear that all down (with very obvious policies that benefit the wealthiest) cannot be ignored.  We've had a massive conservative economic influence for decades, including from the centrist left, and they voted for more of that?  This is why people say they're in for a rude awakening.

There is definitely an information gap for voters, which is why these ""Dems were too mean"" claims fall so flat.  It isn't that Dems are actually saying mean things on any real level.  It is that low info voters are told that Dems are saying mean things by charlatans trying to manipulate them and aren't able to see through it.  So, I completely understand the situation.  I just don't agree with the conclusions of people like Trump who want to claim that only they understand the plight of the working man.",2024_11_12,04_33_33
"Yes, there could be multiple factors.  But we consistently saw that the economy led the way.  Meanwhile, the GOP's trans attack ads were universally detested.  That points to voters caring about costs far more than all the culture war BS, which means the ""Dems told people they were racist and sexist"" claims don't seem to represent most voters.

No, I don't feel smarter when I call out people trying to rewrite history to claim that actually the left were the mean ones and push a slightly rebranded version of the exact same right-wing media boogeymen we've seen for 10 years now from people like Christopher Rufo, Tucker Carlson and all the rest.  This is ""Dems won't let you say 'Merry Christmas' anymore"" and ""CRT means white people should hate themselves"" and ""if you use the wrong pronouns you go to jail"" and all those other lies, but with even less specifics.  Just vague ""Dems were mean and this election proves it"" astroturfing.  It doesn't make me feel smarter because you don't have to be smart to spend time thinking about things and realizing that it's mostly fear-mongering by people with a direct financial incentive to get viewers hooked on hate.

Until everyone accepts that we‚Äôre all voting for an authoritarian statist no matter which candidate it is, we‚Äôre going to continue down the path we‚Äôre on, and to hell with the individual who you are conditioned to hate by the media propaganda you consume.

Even the prospect of more money in pockets will increase the voter base, and then once he establishes the losss of citizenship law, he can continue to pass things that will make it undesirable for birthright citizens to want to be here.

The same idea is put in practice with immigrant holding centers. You make life so unbearable, you get the immigrants to voluntarily leave",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Aside from a continuous stream of lies, the tool of choice of the inbound administration is to dehumanize - immigrant- vermin, Haitians eating pets, PR a garbage can, sooner or later they‚Äôll amp up rhetoric on any one not on board.

5. The inbound circus really only cares about money and power.  Use your pocket book and make purchasing decisions wisely.  Don‚Äôt like Bezos - don‚Äôt buy from Amazon, you get the drift.  

6. Putting a rapist in power has emboldened the worst elements. If you have women in your life you care about, be there for them.  Ensure their safety any way you can.  Urge them to take whatever precautions are necessary to protect themselves.

"> Right now is the phony war. The plans will be telegraphed but not acted upon.

I agree. A lot of this is just supposed to be a mindfuck that goes nowhere but makes people mad, despair, etc.

Look back at Trump's first term and how he endlessly talked about building a wall.... And ended up with just 50 miles of new border wall.

Most of the damage is inflicted through words and rhetoric. Deflecting, ignoring, recognizing it for what it is is critical. 

REAL things and bad situations will happen... And that is WHY people need to keep their mental and emotional defenses up - just ignore the bullshit intended to bring you down - so that they are ready to respond to the REAL things and haven't been beaten into complacency or submission. 

I already see so many people taking the bait and feeling despair... And it's a self-defeating, self-limiting prospect. Trump and friends will say all kinds of terrible things but only a fraction of them are actionable. Self-defense against the rhetoric ensures that our day to day lives continue to be enjoyable, and that we have the strength to fend off the real stuff if it happens.

"That is the one thing democrats will not be able to do, at least not better than republicans. Because what these people want are easy, simple assurances. Trump can make them because there is a well-oiled machine that will parrot it for him and defend him. 
That simply does not exist to that extent on the democratic side. That is why Harris had acknowledge difficulties and try to explain complicated issues. If she hadn't, her own machine would have criticised her.

And even if she had done it, a lot of MAGA men would not see it in the first place, anyway. That is one of the biggest problems here. The dems lost the propaganda war, in many areas because they refused to even engage in it. 

Yes, they need to adjust their content, too. But even if they did burn down their establishment and brought the best and most popular policies it will mean Jack if they can't even reach the ones they want to court.

As long as your standard MAGA male believes that ""Harris has no policies or positions,"" her actual positions and policies simply do not matter one bit. It is nice and important to improve said policies and positions of course, but for those demographics, Trump never ran against the actual democratic party to begin with. He ran against the pronoun-obsessed, men- and America-hating version of said party that is being fabricated for them.

Again, I am not saying that introspection in that area is not imperative. Just that it has to be accompanied by changing the media landscape or it will not work.",2024_11_12,04_33_33

Fat lotta good it's going to do them when the extrajudicial arrests happen. Cowards to their last wimper. The point of no return was rolling back campaign finance law, but stopping the count in Florida in 2000 and denying Obama his Scotus pick in his last year of office were times when the Dems needed a fucking spine to actually do something. 

Trump staged a fucking coup. That was a time in which I think most Americans would be a-ok with a little bit of rule bending to make Trump and the MAGA apparatus suffer some actual fucking consequences. Nope, instead, they capitulated to our endless appeal system.
