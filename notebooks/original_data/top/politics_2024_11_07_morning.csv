"The one american politician where I believe without a shadow of a doubt that he ONLY cares about the people, and not about his own ambitions

Some good fucking news,2024_11_07,00_28_37
"If you liberal motherfuckers hadn’t spent more energy on running him out of the primary in 2020 than you’ve spent on caring about the children in Gaza, we would not be where we are today. This is the democrats fault profoundly and completely. A party ran by yuppies who care about nothing but terminally online cultural issues",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"This probably belongs on the conspiracy sub, but I still think Bernie would have won a presidential election if given a fair chance. Polls showed Bernie would have beat Trump in 2016. But  the Democratic party pushed Hillary on us instead even when polls showed she would lose to Trump. And now they pushed Kamala and here we are again. Trump only wins elections when you put him against women as his primary opponent",2024_11_07,00_28_37

IF they had let him or Kamala have the nom in 2020 instead of gifting it to Biden, you would also have free healthcare right now is Bernie or free healthcare coming in 6 years time with Kamala. 

Dems fucked your country, never more so, than over the past 8 years. Its partly on them for the rise of Trump. He platformed on draining the swamp. Bernie actually would have drained that swamp. 

And now what are we looking at, four more years of Trump? Oh the fucking joy. Cant wait to hear more about more is early morning tweets from the toilet as he tries to push out the previous nights cheesburger.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

How old is he. Unlike certain people we know his mind is sharp. But I think he needs to retire,2024_11_07,00_28_37
"He might be the US' most popular politician, I think because even people who don't like his positions understand he's a real human being who means what he says. He is the ""ideal"" politician, which is a shame, because that same independence puts a ceiling on his influence.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Hopefully they stop relying on abortion to flip white women to the party

Dumb ass Democrats clung on to abortion like idiots when the writing on the wall was clear it's the economy stupid. 

Furthermore states like FLA an MO have demonstrated they can vote for trump while supporting abortion through state level referendums. 

For example FLAs got to 58npercent of a needed 60 to overturn the abortion ban there. And Missouri literally succeeded. 

Like trump said, abortion is not the firebrand issue the Dems thought

And the vote shows that white women can vote based on their pocketbokk and still support abortion access....further trump said NO National Ban and return the issue to states to decide. As he predicted and I mention some were more liberal than we assumed 


Then as a black man I think how in our circles we talk about reparations. The say No reparations the best I can do for you is abortion.  Abortion just isn't the big issue


2. The disregard for the Palestine issue. No explanation needed

3. No plan for migrants. Spends years calling trump racist and ignore calls tomshut down border only to have Biden do it in the last half of 24. Signalling republicans were right all along. 

4.  Then I think of young men. When I went to college in 2013, all that rape culture, toxic masculinity white privilege stuff was just coming out and we found it a little weird then too. Ten years later, kids who grew up with it from their toddler years to now are over it . Manospnere people and Rogan not feeling it. Young men went trump 

Speaking of that Bernie Bros 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 

5. Latinos didn't care about trump attacks on migrants. The ones who can vote are already citizens 🤷🏿‍♂️. Why would they care about people who ""skipped the line""

6.. I could go on but this election effort from Dems just seems incompetent. 

I was poised to see trump lose popular but he shellacked her. This is a clear mandate. As a Kamala voter, I support Trump's win and hope he does well to help us all do better.

I grew up in Vermont. When Bernie was first running for representative a school project was to research the candidates and give a speech about their stance on important issues. This was in 1988 so before the Internet so I did some research in the papers but also called the campaign office so I could get it straight from the horses mouth. I was lucky enough to get straight to the horse himself and got to talk to Bernie for 10-15 minutes about his beliefs and how important that a high schooler like me was getting involved in politics.

People would have voted for the old white guy who was grumpy about big money interests and passionate about wanting to improve living conditions over the old white guy who was a braggart about his riches and full of hate in every speech.

Bernie’s message was exactly what the country needed to hear. If people heard Bernie talking about how we are all brothers and sisters and that a nation is judged by how we treat the most vulnerable folks among us, the country would have come together more instead of splitting further apart.

Bernie was saying at his rallies and news appearances that “I care about your children as I hope you care about mine” and that elderly people shouldn’t have to cut their medicine in half to make the prescription last until they could afford a refill, and that he is sick and tired of seeing unarmed black men being shot.

Gallup polls consistently show that 40% of voters identify as independent compared to 30% who identify as Democrat and 30% as Republican. As an Independent, Bernie was able to bring people in to the Democratic Party that didn’t consider themselves Democrats. As a general election candidate he would have grown the party beyond its base.

Edit: People don't seem to get it, being a socialist in the heart of capitalism is playing politics in ultrahardcore. He was the only socialist mayor in an America Reagan won by a landslide.

Roosevelt or Abraham Lincoln when it comes to impressive/great American leaders/politicians. Yes, he's not as influental as the other examples, but as you said, that's also due to the platform he's campaigning on (social democracy, in America viewed as socialism). Despite cancer like Fox News poisoning American democracy for decades now he still manages to steer the US in a more civilised direction.

Also, that Robinson guy was so catastrophically bad as a candidate that polls were showing him losing by like 15-20 points.  If he was only moderately bad he might have driven Democratic turnout to defeat him…..but it’s been obvious for weeks he was going to lose like 55% - 40%.  And Stein is pretty moderate.

"Basically while I won't say the other states don't matter, nothing in polls indicates that they are close, so news outlets feel comfortable calling them early.


Barring a monumental error in polling, most states are not going to be a surprise. Democrats tend to do best in the northeast, and the west coast - and polls have not yet closed on the west coast, so no one's going to call the races until the polls close but no one, not even Trump, think he's got a shot at winning Washington, Oregon and California.

Essentially, the states that have the opportunity to really ""decide"" the election (because they are statistically very close) are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 

This is why they're referred to as battleground states, because they are so close that no one really knows for sure which direction they'll go. And again, while other states DO matter, what they will vote is more-or-less taken for granted, and as such, the above named 7 states are really the ones that will be the difference maker one way or another - the results in those are the ones that you need to pay attention to.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

America as a democracy is slowly crumbling before our eyes, but the world will go on.

The Good:

1. We democratically elected a President. There was no violence (although if the Dems had won, Trump was certainly going to incite more violence). Historically speaking, people get the elected leaders they deserve.

The Bad:

1. Competent Government: There is no question that Kamala would have presided over a competent Federal government. She had sound policies (which btw were incredibly centrist) that are supported by a majority of Americans. Trump will install political hacks and sycophants in all levels of government. How do I know, check schedule F. We are in for bureaucratic nightmares.
2. Economy. The US economy by all measures is the best of the developed world since COVID, by a long shot. Stock market indices are good, inflation has cooled, unemployment is at its lowest sustained levels in years, ,manufacturing jobs roared back under Biden. So essentially Biden took a shitty economy (which BTW was not all of Trump's fault, but he does share quite a bit of blame, his taxation policies have continued the hollowing out of the middle class by transferring the tax burden from the super rich down to lower economic brackets) and landed it perfectly (with help from the Federal Reserve). Trump's policies will have some pretty negative long-term consequences for the U.S. When they say tax cuts, everyone making under $360,000 will see their taxes increase, only those making over $360,000 will see a decrease in their taxes.
3. Environment. Regulations designed to protect human health and welfare will be eroded. When you get pancreatic cancer from PFOA/PFAS I hope you buy a MAGA branded colostomy bag from Team Trump.
4. Education. They are going to continue to devalue education, expect the quality of education in this country to decline.
5. Health Care: We already have a health care system that is in shambles. No western country pays more for health care and has worse outcomes. If you really want to understand why I would highly suggest reading ""America's Bitter Pill"" by Stephen Brill.

The Ugly

1. Hate. America embraced hate like it has never embraced hate before. First election of Trump, yeah, I'll give you a pass for electing him, but second go round, you know exactly who you voted for and why. Don't kid yourself, there have been white nationalist movements in this country going all the way back to the Know-nothings, but MAGA is that on on JP-5. It is cruelty to those that are the most vulnerable amongst us, people of color, immigrants, the marginalized. Those people will lose the most. A President that called large swaths of American citizens ""the enemy"" and turned American's against each other is now going to be there for the next four years.
2. Constitutional Government. Americans elected a President that has continually shown is willing to break the law and ignore the Constitution, the Guardrails are off. The adults that were in the room that recognized the importance of the constitution are gone. All bets are off, we have Full Monty Trump and it is going to be day-after-day constitutional ass-wiping for the next four years. He is who is is, and he will do what he says is going to do, he has also packed the court with ideologues that have skewed versions of the Constitution and the limits of executive authority.
3. Russia. The biggest winner in all of this. While MAGA was popping corks and DEMS were in tears nobody noticed that Russia actively attacked our election. They attacked in the lead-up and they attacked it on election day. This happened and really it should be the lead story. It is also hugely problematic that Twitter (X) is also being used as a propaganda tool for the Russian government. When Musk had shortfalls to purchase, he relied on outside investors including some Middle Eastern and Russian, to front the money. With Musk's contacts with Putin, this is incredibly problematic. I find it interesting that the MAGA crowd, who is virulently anti-communist, is okay with Musk's cozying up to communist and a Presidential candidate that has had multiple off-the-record conversations with Putin. I am not saying that Musk or Trump committed treason, but they are sailing perilously close to the fucking wind here.

There is much more but this is the sad truth. The national media is also to blame here, but probably not for the reason's you think (especially MAGA). We live in a nation that has fully embraced fear and ignorance, we will reap what we sow. Americans are asking the wrong questions. Do we want to live in a country in which the richest control access to the truth? Do we want an economy that destroys the middle class? Do we want to continue to degrade the environment?",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"She is at 66.8M at the *current* vote count. The final tally will be somewhere between 66M and 81M because there are still a good chunk of uncounted votes out there. 

Only 54% of California votes have been reported and Harris is currently at 5.6M votes there. She is going to get roughly another 5M votes there once they count and report all of them. Washington is at 62% reporting and she has 1.5M votes there, which means she will likely pull another 500k or so there. Oregon is at 73% and she's sitting at 940k votes, which means she likely has another 250k incoming. Arizona is 61% reported and she is sitting at 1M votes, so probably another 400k there. Colorado is at 75% reported and she has 1.3M votes, so probably another 400k there. These are probably the largest outstanding batches, but there are going to be 5 and 6 figure vote batches for her from all the other states.

She isn't going to match the 81M from 2020, but she's going to beat 2016 by a hefty margin. Her final vote tally will likely be in the mid 70Ms.

If you actually try to listen to working-class conservatives concerns and viewpoints, their worldview is no longer aligned with reality. They really think the Democrats are a shadowy cabal of ultra-rich elites pulling the strings to impoverish society...when in fact it is generally republican megadonors doing that exact thing.

People want this. It doesn't matter what the Dems ran, because what people want is what its billionaires want it to want. They gave it a Trump in clear mental decline, convicted of felonies, post insurrection, legally liable for sexual abuse, plainly, clearly responsible for absolutely nothing of positive effect to the general population at any point not just in his tenure as President but his entire career as a public figure. He ran an appreciably terrible campaign that only ever got worse the longer it went on.

He won the popular vote.

America does not want to be a Democracy anymore. It does not matter what the other party runs, because America wants to be an Oligarchy. It wants to have a brand sold to it by billionaires, and it wants to feel good by buying that brand.

Kamala just didn't get the same voters as Biden.

We basically reverted back to pre-2016 voter turnout which is to say - fucking abysmal.

"It's really an issue of how the US structured their school funding and territories (largely around segregation and wealth strata). Your poor neighborhood school failed because its only allowed funding from the local taxpayers, which are deflated due to the poor area. Your rich neighbor's property taxes go to their school, which only they can attend, and so they get a better education by virtue of living in the right part of town. 

Other nations fund schools nationally, and the quality of education in both neighborhoods would be roughly the same, with only private schools for the wealthy being able to create a ""wealthier learning environment"" and so giving every student a fair chance. 

No Child Left Behind was just another conservative mandate to harm education where it pretended the US system didn't exist, and then demanded all schools that received federal funding grants perform or lose the money, which was ironic because losing the money guaranteed they would never reach passing again on their own. 

TLDR - NCLB was written by conservatives to screw education for the already lower-middle-class-and-below family intentionally. Its no wonder the wealthy neighborhoods don't suffer from it.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"""Voters who signed up for Elon Musk’s million-dollar voter giveaway are suing the Tesla Inc. chief and his America PAC, claiming entrants were misled about how winners were picked.

A day after surviving a legal challenge in Pennsylvania, Musk’s daily sweepstakes was hit Tuesday with fresh claims in federal courts in Texas and Michigan.

Jacqueline McAferty of Arizona alleged she never would have signed the America PAC petition and handed over personal identifying information if she knew the winners weren’t picked at random and she had no chance of taking home $1 million. In reality, the winners weren’t picked at random, but were carefully selected to be spokespeople for the pro-Donald Trump political action committee.""

So long as there's no binding arbitration clause in play it seems like a very strong case for a breach of contract case - we know the set amount of money in play that was denied to the claimants and know that none of the claimants had a chance to win any of it, so split the total between all of them.

"So... the tale of Elon Musk goes back before most people knew his name, and after daddy's mine money.

Musk was one of the core people at PayPal back in the late 90s, and he had a vision -- he wanted to make ""the everything app"" and call it X.  Does this sound a little familiar?

He was fully convinced that he was right, and kept pushing the company to do it his way.  But he always wanted to use a stack that *could not possibly work* in that day and age, and would have been a total rewrite of basically everything.  Does this sound a little familiar?

Edit: ~~So he effectively staged a coup within PayPal while someone was on their honeymoon.~~  He started *forcing* his changes, and they ousted him while he was on his honeymoon.  Does this sound a little familiar?

He got kicked out of the company.  He was effectively given a ""fuck off fee"".  They wanted him gone so badly *they paid him to leave*.

He is still trying, nearly 30 years later, to prove that he was right all along.  He needs to prove that they were the dumb ones, that he was the smart one.  It's why he's convinced his daughter hates him because she was radicalized (not because he's shitty to trans people), as well.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

I don’t care how “clear” he claims this law to be, it is untested and therefore by definition not clear since we don’t have much relevant precedent to base these circumstances on.

The 2nd part about the pollsters is just objectively false. Must required that people signing the petition be registered voters. That is by definition an incentive because the voter was the one who had to take action to register and then sign the petition. Random pollsters calling from a list of people to pay for surveys being filled out provides no such incentive. The very fact he’s trying to use this as an example shows me he’s a paid expert, and not being objective.

 Everything in me despises Trump's politics, but the Democratic party hasn't been able to effectively relate to lower class middle Americans for some time. Calling key voters an ""inbred family in the middle of nowhere"" just pushes the elitist and dismissive narratives that have pushed so many key voters away from the Democratic party. To add to this look at the poll results right now, Trumps also winning the popular vote. While the electoral college sucks, theres a problem here that can't be pinned on the college alone.  

 I'm almost equally frustrated with the Democratic party with this election. This should have been an easy win, but since Obama left office Democratic party leadership has been weak and completely unmarketable to moderate voters. 

 To win people away from Trumpism the Democratic party needs to move away from this elitism and towards more moderate and obtainable goals. To be honest I think they've done a great job with this over the last election cycle, but it was far too little too late.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"If the topic continues to come up - you can always give them a visual example.

Gin up a decent-sized batch of ballots - neutral, of course - think ""Team Triangle"" vs ""Team Hexagon"". Give one side a few more votes, but not very many. Then split up the votes among the class - hand a relative few each to the vast majority of the students, that are heavily weighted towards one side. Split the rest among just a few students, but heavily weighted to the other side.

Have a pair of students take in results as each counter finishes - one receives and writes them down, the other one does the calculations to update who's ahead as close to live as possible.

This will show them in a way they can grasp why and how the votes can change, and so suddenly, as various precincts finish tabulating and reporting.

Edit: To help fold in absentee ballots, seal a few smaller, but significant, batches of votes in envelopes. Tell the students that these represent vote-by-mail, but they can't be opened until ""the state allows it"" - which is you. So at some point about halfway through the process, drop these envelopes onto students' desks and tell them to add those to their list.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"100000000%

Prices will not come down (stopping/lowering inflation means stopping/slowing the RISE in prices not LOWERING them and those prices are here to stay as it’s a global issue)

If he’s serious about his tarrifs, prices will mostly go up

The government will be more useless than it has ever been unless you’re a friend of Trump’s

Mass deportation will not occur, just a blanket dragnet on people of color and harassment of their rights

It will be far more difficult to immigrate here

Hate crimes will spike (they did during his last administration, why wouldn’t they again with a campaign even more racist and dehumanizing than the last one?)

Protests will probably turn more violent as Trump has no one to talk him down from deploying the military against them like in his previous admin

Pollution will increase, city infrastructures will decay, public health will be threatened

1000s of career civil servants who have an expertise in their fields (lot of scientists and doctors) will be fired and/or replaced by Trump loyalists who have no clue what they’re doing

Unions and workers rights will be challenged and likely weakened as Trump judicial appointments make new rulings

Abortion and birth control access are a big question mark imo, Trump really kinda went his own direction against the party line on it, but his judicial appointments will most likely make access to both of those harder depending on the state

Our nation’s influence will be weakened as foreign actors prey upon Trump’s ego and deep insecurities

China will fill the void we leave behind if Trump really goes for the isolationist foreign policy his supporters seem to want, people don’t seem to grasp that foreign aid is not really “foreign aid”, it’s an investment that helps us get something we want from a nation in exchange for an extremely small percentage of our budget

Bibi Netanyahu will get a greenlight to do whatever he wants, so the situation in the Middle East will probably get worse before it gets better

Depending on the emergency, most states (especially those with Democrat governors) will likely be on their own to handle the crisis just as we saw during covid and bc the Federal appointees will likely be people without any real experience/conspiracy theorists loyal to protecting Trump’s image over us, many Republicans also seem to not be in favor of giving FEMA the funding it needs on the Federal level

God help us if RFK Jr. takes over the Health and Human Services Department

More Gripen, more Rafale, more Eurofighter will be sold throughout Europe and less F-16 and F-35. Eventually Europe will come up with its own stealth fighter.

I personally don’t think they’re up to it.  The people they have in office have gotten fat off of endless posturing that if only they could apply their vision and fulfill the values of their ideology we’d have a better life, a better country.

I've dedicated most of my life to working to make our country and the world a better place.

This election showed me that the country just doesn't care or want what I have to offer anymore.  I don't think we are that stupid as a people that we don't know what just happened--we threw our democracy in the garbage bin because the price of eggs was too high.  I suppose the US had a pretty average run as far as the rise and fall of empires goes--will never compare to the Egyptian, Greek, Roman or British Empires, but we had a 250 year run.  Its just a shame that we willingly gave it all away for such stupid reasons.

**America Deserves Donald Trump. The World Doesn’t.**

The president-elect has no philosophy or policy, and his incoherence about global relations is not feigned.

November 6, 2024 at 8:25 AM EST

By Andreas Kluth


It’s his world now.

Every country gets the government it deserves, it has been said, and America now gets a second administration led by Donald Trump. But the rest of the world did not vote in the US election. Does it deserve what comes next?

And what exactly is that? The planet’s most important relationship is arguably that between the world as a whole and its most powerful nation, even if it’s no longer a superpower, hyperpower or “hegemon.” That relationship, much more so than in Trump’s first term, is now in flux, adrift, undefined.

Trump campaigned on a vacuous premise that he will deliver peace through “strength” without ever spelling out the sources or objectives of that strength. When he was president, he has bragged, “We didn’t have countries fighting each other, they wouldn’t have done it without my permission.” What a joke.

Come January, we’ll find out if Trump’s fellow strongmen ask for permission from his White House as they make their moves in geopolitics. Russia’s Vladimir Putin, with his KGB-trained mind, has always known how to flatter and manipulate Trump, and that’s what worries Ukraine. China’s Xi Jinping has taken note of Trump’s inconsistent statements about Taiwan, and is ready to wage the trade war that Trump promises to launch.

North Korea’s Kim Jong Un already knows Trump from three summits and a brief exchange of “love letters”; as a direct result of that failed flirtation, he went full-bore in building nukes and missiles to threaten South Korea, Japan and the US. The mullahs in Iran probably do fear Trump — but they may now follow North Korea’s strategy of self-protection with nuclear weapons.

America’s allies, meanwhile, have no idea what’s coming but fear the worst. Trump has, after all, threatened to pull out of NATO and to abandon partners if they don’t buy enough chips or cars or steel from the US. Not least, anybody who cares about international law and the United Nations has reason to despair: Trump doesn’t understand the UN as an institution or an idea, and he disdains what he doesn’t understand.

It’s become de rigueur among Washington’s foreign-policy “blob” to affix “isms” to Trump’s foreign-policy style, like MAGA buttons to lapels. He’s a nationalist, they say, or an isolationist, mercantilist, realist, unilateralist, and so forth. All partially true — and all beside the point.


The person who has best captured the man’s worldview is John Bolton, a notorious hawk who did a stint as Trump’s national security adviser. The critical point is that Trump has “neither philosophy nor policies,” Bolton says. Trump’s decisions on national security are entirely transactional, he writes, spread on the map like “an archipelago of dots, unconnected by chords of logic, salience or results.”

The optimistic spin on Trump’s approach is that it’s a new and amped version of the “madman theory” that was once attributed to Richard Nixon (although Machiavelli long ago suggested that it can indeed be a “wise thing to simulate madness”). By that logic, America’s foes and friends alike will be docile out of sheer fear: What might this man do, with or without a nuclear button?

But the madman theory — never properly elaborated or tested — assumes a leader who has a compass and a mental map, and feigns occasional derangement tactically to navigate to his strategic destination. Trump has neither compass nor map. If his foreign policy seems incoherent bordering on mad, he may not be feigning. America could actually find itself adrift in his archipelago of dots, also called the world.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"🇺🇸 Today, there is no “they,” only “we.” We cling to that illusion of division like it’s the last life raft, pretending we’re not all slowly sinking into the same sea of chaos. Aren’t we supposed to be Americans? Or is that just something we slap on the Fourth of July and forget about once the fireworks are over? As author and activist Arundhati Roy put it, “The war is not over; it is not even beginning; we are all in it.” (Roy, Field Notes on Democracy, 2008). It’s hard to pretend we’re separate when we’re all in the same sinking boat.

At some point, we sold our future for pocket change—sacrificing any long-term hope for the shallow comfort of a few extra dollars today. A cheaper tank of gas, a little tax break, maybe even a handful of crumbs to make us feel like we’ve won. And yet, most don’t see how deep Project 2025 and those “innocent” tariffs will cut into their lives. We’ve become a nation so wrapped up in our own smugness, we’re too distracted to notice the slow-motion disaster heading straight for us. As journalist Chris Hedges said, “We are a society that is on the edge of ruin, and the people are too distracted by the drama to notice.” (Hedges, America: The Farewell Tour, 2018). The kicker? The ones who cheered it all on are going to be the first ones to feel the sting.

If this is MAGA’s promised land, then sure—bring on those falling prices, the affordable gas, the groceries that magically cost less. But my gut tells me that’s about as likely as pigs flying. The idea that one person can “save the economy” while conveniently ignoring the rest of the world is almost adorable—like watching a toddler believe that closing their eyes means they’re invisible. As economist Joseph Stiglitz aptly noted, “Markets are global, and the idea that a single nation can somehow insulate itself from global forces is delusional.” (Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited, 2017).

When the reckoning comes, at least we’ll have the privilege of saying, “we told you so.” Not that it’ll make a difference. I can already hear the chorus of MAGA voices scrambling to point the finger at everyone else, even though they’ve got the Senate, House, Supreme Court, and Presidency locked down. Watching them contort themselves to blame “the others” when they’re the only ones with their hands on the wheel will be an impressive spectacle—if it weren’t so painfully predictable. As political commentator Thomas Frank observed, “Blaming the elites is a convenient way of not facing the reality that we, as a society, are complicit in this mess.” (Frank, Listen, Liberal, 2016).

This country’s moral compass is so broken, it’s practically a modern art piece. We’re hanging on by a thread, and any hope of a miraculous comeback feels like a bad joke. Whatever storm is coming, we rolled out the welcome mat. We earned it—every dark, twisted moment of it. As historian Howard Zinn warned, “The problem is not that we are too few, but that we are too few who are willing to stand up.” (Zinn, A People’s History of the United States, 1980).  🇺🇸",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"A lot of the blame goes to democrats.

Given that this was a must need to defeat Trump election, the democrats screwed up.

1. Biden should have never sought re-election in the first place.  We could have had an actual primary season and chosen the best candidate to defeat Trump.

2.  Given the sad truth that the country still is racist and sexist in many ways, did we really think fronting a black woman candidate (particularly one that did not distinguish herself as VP) was a path to victory?    Her sex and her race should not matter, but sadly it does.  If this was an absolutely must win, then we should have taken that in account.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

Now, anyone armed with Google and Occam's Razor could debunk absurdities like Biblical literacy within seconds, and it kinda worked.

2. Atheists became viewed as ""well actually"" insufferable nerds, despite being right. What it really bumped up against is the notion that in any social interaction, facts don't matter.

"We really need to teach economics as part of compulsory education. As someone with an economics degree, it was so frustrating to see people support Trump based on fundamental misunderstandings of how the economy works, especially the fact that the executive branch has very little impact on inflation if the Fed retains its historical independence, which was the case with the massive COVID monetary stimulus.

Also, if the Fed lost its independence and becomes beholden to the executive branch and starts adjusting interest rates to decrease inflation purely due to political concerns, say hello to the unemployment line! Adjusting interest rates and maintaining the appropriate balance between employment and inflation is delicate as hell, and we really don't need politics fucking that up all the time. That's how you end up like Venezuela or Argentina.

And what's doubly frustrating is that the Fed wouldn't have had to respond so dramatically (or rather, for as long as it did) if Trump hadn't completely fucked up the federal response to COVID as badly as he did, meaning that inflation might not have been as bad if the Fed didn't have to maintain low interest rates for as long as it did.

"> *The key to understanding the Trump era is that the real divide in America is not between left and right but between pro-system and anti-system politics. Pro-system politics is the bipartisan consensus of establishment Democrats and Republicans: it’s the politics of NATO and other military alliances, of trade agreements, and of deference to economists (as when they say that price gouging isn’t the cause of inflation). Trump stands for no fixed ideology, but rather a general thumbing of the nose at this consensus. The main fact of American politics in the post-Obama era is that an ever larger majority of Americans are angry at the status quo and open to anti-system politics.*

Yes.  This is what the MAGA-sphere has been saying since Bernie was thrown under the bus.

Most people care about shit like this. We could still push many great progressive policies through in America if we just also catered to the average mostly uneducated person.  Why can't they just learn to spin the policies that many of us agree with into words and phrases that the average joe can understand... they use such college text book politicians while the average person can understand the frustrations of  an idiot like Trump but not from someone like Kamala who gives off an air of superiority even though i'm certain democrats werent purposely trying to make her and their candidates seem like that.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"I whole-heartedly reject this argument.  Thats not to say Democrats aren't to blame, but focusing on that lets the American electorate off the hook.  We knew exactly what donald trump is, what he does when he has power, and what he plans to do with it again.  And we voted for it.  This was more than just a vote, it was a statement on the moral rot of our national character.  

Policy or messaging tweeks, coalition triangulations, pivots, even an entirely different approach to selecting a nominee...None of these are any match for the forces that won last night.  Democrats were offering policies within the framework of a democratic republic.  America didn't reject the policies, they rejected the very framework in which they were offered, the framework that has existed for nearly 250 years.  No Democrat was going to win in an environment that was this hostile to democracy.  Americans dont want a politician, and they dont want political leadership.  They want to burn it all down and make their fellow Americans suffer 

Only a deeply sick and disturbed country could elect donald trump.  Tax credits, health care offerings, and jobs for people without college degrees aren't going to cure that sickness.  Its going to take a lot more than policy to cure these deep social ills that are only poised to get worse with trump back in charge.

As much as Democrats choked, its time to stop blaming Dems for the fact that so many americans want fascism.  People are responsible for their choices.

voting for donald trump is a grotesque moral failure on behalf of this country and each and every person that voted for him.  The people that made that choice deserve the blame before the Democrats.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"THANK YOU.

I didn't know a single person excited for Kamala IRL. Everyone I knew said she was going to lose and she did. Put up an actually electable person who can talk, has real opinions, actual policy beyond talking about their opponent and how bad they are, and has a chance.

I refuse to believe she was the best person the DNC had for the job. She was the one the elite donors wanted, and they fucked the ENTIRE COUNTRY due to their hubris.

Half the r/politics board is still 'KAMALA WINS X' stories. This place has become a horrific echo chamber with no ability to accept the reality of the situation. Telling everyone ""SUCK IT UP AND VOTE FOR THE BAD CANDIDATE, OR DO YOU WANT TRUMP?"" clearly isn't a working strategy. You can't shame people into voting if they can just stay home. 

There are better candidates. Run them. Don't run a bad one and you won't have to spend the whole election cycle propping them up. It was clear she wasn't ready and her policies weren't her own.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"Look, it's completely fair to say that the Democratic party could've done this or that better.

But at the end of the day, I really don't think Kamala was a bad candidate, nor do I think she ran a bad campaign. She didn't win, but that doesn't mean she was bad or did a bad job.

It's frustrating that more people didn't go out and vote for her, but it's also very frustrating that Republican voters continue to bend the knee for Donald Trump.

I'm sorry, but I don't know how anyone with any level of decency can look at this choice and think Trump is a better candidate. He's a rich old asshole that acts like a toddler, he tried to overthrow the government because he didn't like that he lost the last election, he whines about unsubstantiated election fraud, he's very openly misogynistic and bigoted, and he fetishizes dictators. Sure, Harris may not be ""perfect"", but between the two, it should be a no brainer who is the adult in the room.

But instead, Republican voters continue bending the knee to Trump because they like when he acts like an internet edgelord, and they scream about ""Big Macs cost $1000 now, it's all the Dems' fault, rawr!"".

Are there lessons to be learned here for the democratic party? Sure. But let's not pretend Harris was a ""bad"" candidate simply because she wasn't perfect. If people still look at Trump, the nearly 80 year old rich asshole con man criminal bigoted insurrectionist, and go ""That's my guy!"", I think it's pretty clear that there's something very broken in the minds of a lot of people.

In any case, it doesn't really matter any longer. Odds are, this was the last proper election. We've pretty likely thrown away democracy in favor of installing a giant toddler wannabe-dictator as our king.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

You’ve heard it all through this election cycle that minority groups like Black men have just been completely left behind over the years, working class support for democrats has just consistently eroded yet is paved over by endorsements from labor union elites, and democrats have consistently entertained the same dark money that has flooded conservative politics while batting an eye at the double standard.

This party has been perfect at attracting support on the basis that “we’ll get it right next time” and has consistently taken that for granted.

The Democrats apparently lost 15 *million* voters between election cycles, as measured by the popular vote, while Republicans numbers were basically the same, or within a few percent.

That's TRUE but it's not going to get the job done.  You can't concede ""I need everyone else in the nation to be better people"".  You need to find out why they're so drawn to this guy, or at least, why so many weren't drawn to yours.

The answer is that we are selfish and self centered.  You may wish we weren't, but we are.  Trump looked at those people and said ""I will make YOUR lives better"".  This is of course an insane lie, but that doesn't matter.  He let them feel like they're being seen. He told people ""I see your struggle and I will fix it"".  

The Dems have made their platform all about fixing OTHER people's struggles.  And wagging their finger at you about why you should care about them.  You should care about trans kids and immigrants and Ukraine.  

And yeah.  You should!  But at the end of the day most don't and that isn't going to change.  ""Other people will suffer"" will never be as good a platform as ""I will stop **your** suffering"".  We just aren't a compassionate enough people for that.  

Campaigns from the left need to find a way to tell people that ""I will stop **your** suffering"".  Not the suffering of people I don't see or feel.  The people in my household.  The way they lost votes in strong union states to a self professed union buster is a massive indictment of how far the left has fallen from making the working people feel seen.  

You don't even have to mean it.  Trump certainly doesn't.  But that's the message you have to get out.  It's how Obama won.  He gave those people hope for change.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

Bottom line is propaganda and misinformation work because our electorate is disengaged and uninterested in nuance and detail. We are not lead by principles and ideas, and we aren’t worried about how what we do today will show up tomorrow. We’re just coasting on the idea that things will work out if we keep up the positive vibes, and we just have to soldier on in the meantime, because what’s the alternative?

People are sick of getting beat up economically and they sick of having to deal with people that make them question their worldview, and no, they are not going to take the time to parse and understand real problems and real solutions.

"This may be a dumb question. But without all the votes in how do they determine who is a winner and loser for each state? Looking at the data on google they use historical data to pre determine the results of a state online. If only 40% precincts have reported for a state how do they know a states results with certainty?

I can see this with a number of reporting precincts correlating with the number of remaining voters becoming a mathematical impossibility for the vote to swing back to another candidate.  But then when I checked Mississippi on the map on google it had 4% of precincts reporting but had already given the state to trump? 

I’m just asking because I feel like this is part of why people think a states vote was defrauded. Like we’re getting ahead of ourselves a bit before all the results are in. As with Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona last time the deciding votes weren’t counted for days. 

I’m just hoping someone smarter than me can explain this for me.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Take this as a straightforward observation, not a prescription. White Democrats often miss that pushing LGBTQ+ issues has ended up being a net negative among Latino voters. You have to be practical about what actually matters to them. The ""Latinx"" label, for example, has seriously backfired. For the vast majority of Spanish speakers, who take pride in their language, this term was never an issue—until it was pushed on them.

Yes, there's real progress, with around half of Latino voters now backing same-sex marriage. But ""Latinx"" is a major unforced error by Democrats. As a native Spanish speaker who’s been around Latinos my whole life, even the most progressive ones I know react to ""Latinx"" with a serious eye-roll. The typical response? “White people really need to stop.” While the term wasn’t initially coined by white people, once they saw a few Latino voices championing it, it was quickly weaponized, irritating the majority of Latinos even more.

Is this single issue costing Democrats the election? No. But it’s a perfect example of unnecessary, tone-deaf social blunders that are alienating their own base.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"It’s not a dumb question. 

The news places call it because they have access to insane levels of data that is regulars don’t.

They have exit polling per county. They have Cambridge Analytica. They have phone polling. They have years worth of information ready to go. 

It is literally just that. They know how unreported counties are voting and how much of that vote is likely to head to one or another college vote. When the percentage tallies are clear for one candidate, they call it. ",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"They take a lot of data into account. It’s not just historical data, they also use polling, both before and exit polling. They also know roughly the amount of voters, where they’re located, and how they’re predicted to vote. Basically, at a certain point they find it mathematically impossible to overcome: you don’t have enough votes left to make up the difference.

Most races like Mississippi are essentially already determined.

And for the record: Georgia and Pennsylvania were never called early. In fact, Georgia isn’t out for Kamala right now even if it looks bad. The majority of the remaining votes are in Atlanta which leans heavily blue.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Female turnout in the US election is set to be high, according to early exit polls that could prove to be a boost for Kamala Harris.

Early data shows women accounting for some 53 per cent of the vote, six points ahead of men, and one point up on the last election.

In another possible boost for Harris, voters think the state of democracy is the most important issue at this election

Ms Harris has put abortion and the threat to democracy posed by Donald Trump at the centre of her campaign.

The exit polls showed 35 per cent of voters say the future of democracy in the US is a top concern, ahead of the economy (31 per cent), abortion (18 per cent) immigration (14 per cent).

Millions of voters across the US have flocked to polling stations with reports of record turnout in a number of states, including key battlegrounds such as Georgia and North Carolina.

Those of us in the working class in what the left refers to as ""flyover states"" (many of us can't even afford to fly, richie rich) look at states like California, NY, etc. and see the cost of living in such places. That is attributed to Democratic party policy.

"> Exit polls are conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool on behalf of a consortium of media companies: CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC. They get their name because interviewers on Election Day are stationed outside roughly 500 polling locations throughout the country, where they conduct surveys with a randomly selected sample of voters who’ve just cast their ballots. The polling locations were themselves selected through random sampling, meaning the resulting interviews should be representative of Election Day voters across the state or nationally. The interviewers call back to report their results several times throughout the day – which means that the early numbers will likely change as more data comes in.

2) Fear on lack of security 

3) specialized high schools, African Americans are for cancelation of entrance exams. 

There was a dem rep trying to explain she was not for migrant shelter and was basically told to get lost.

Edit: a couple more thoughts

1) NYC have several Chinatowns, I was actually referring to the one in Brooklyn. 

2) Migrant shelter have been a huge weight on local's minds as well as crime. There have a huge pro-gun movement for the same reason. My wife work with a local media, and she struggle to find any supporters there.

3) Election in all Chinatown have moved rightwards from the 2020 BLM/Asian violence spree. And dem's solutions just wasn't that popular culturally. 

4) the Brooklyn Chinatown's state senator just got flipped by a Chinese Republican ex cop with less than 10k, against a Taiwanese woman with over 500k in the war chest. (Google Steve chan). 

5) and of course, some feel the need to thank Republicans for ending Affirmative action. (The Asian dad vote, heh)

There's also a lot of people who would rather see something taken from someone else than someone be given something they won't get.

I'd also argue that the left tend to pick their battles poorly and fight around fringe issues and what the majority want to hear is that they can get a job, get paid and put a roof over their familes while living in comfort.

"Emperor Norton made 'proclamations' supporting church-state separation and opposed state Sunday laws.

He supported women's right to vote.

He believed in the right of the people to fair taxes and basic services (such as well-maintained streets and public transportation). He supported technological innovations that improved public welfare.

He issued two proclamations, in 1869 and 1876, calling for the dissolution of the Democratic and Republican parties.

He issued decrees calling for the construction of a bridge or tunnel to connect Oakland and San Francisco. These decrees were prescient, as the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube were eventually built. 

And In 1872, he issued a decree that levied a $25 penalty on anyone who used the nickname ""Frisco"" (I firmly agree with this).

However, members of a San Francisco businessmen's association, the Pacific Club, established a funeral fund that provided for a handsome rosewood casket and arranged a dignified farewell. Norton's funeral on Saturday, January 10, was solemn, mournful, and large. Paying their respects were members of ""all classes from capitalists to the pauper, the clergyman to the pickpocket, well-dressed ladies and those whose garb and bearing hinted of the social outcast"". The next day, the *San Francisco Chronicle* reported, under the headline ""Le Roi Est Mort,"" that some 10,000 people had come to view the emperor's body in advance of the 2 p.m. funeral.

Kinda weird this is even an electoral district tbh,2024_11_07,00_28_37
Was anyone surprised? DC has voted Democratic in literally every election since it gained the Presidential vote in 1964 with the 23rd Amendment. Even the hopeless ones like [1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_United_States_presidential_election) and [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_United_States_presidential_election). Which is why the Republicans are terrified of ever giving Puerto Rico statehood and the Presidential vote.,2024_11_07,00_28_37

"No Jon, we are tired of always having to fight. And this just proves that most of America is exactly what we are fighting against and there is a level of apathy in the non-voting population that does not care one bit. 

That said, there are a few ways I will conduct my business to make it harder for the coming oligarchy to reign; for starters, delete Twitter.  Just don't give that platform any ad revenue. Tank its user base and let those corporations find some place else to go. Elmo does not need more help than he can get.  

Hoard money.  Just save as much money as you can. Buy local, buy used when applicable, learn to do things yourself as much as possible.

Take care of your health.  Eat right and exercise.

We don't know how much fuckery the right is going to do to elections going forward, but if you can move from a red state to a swing state, maybe try for that, but if you truly feel vulnerable and can manage it, move to a blue state.  The issue with moving from a red to a blue state is it further stratifies the divide between how many red states there are versus blue states which then sends more power to the Senate towards the republicans. There are far more red states than blue states.

Lastly, just love your loved ones. Hold them and protect them.  Cherish all the good times you will have going forward, and yes, even amongst the coming misery, there will be good times as well. Value those moments. This malaise will last for a bit, but eventually you will recenter yourself.

"Fight for.... what exactly? The idea of American exceptionalism?  Well I hate to break it to Jon, but American exceptionalism isn't a history of exceptionalism at all.  It's a history of greed and mistreatment.

We're a nation built on slavery, war, civil rights violations, and over consumption.  Our main benefit over other nations seems to just be that we're on a continent that's difficult to invade that is resource rich.

Know how everyone is real worried about climate change right now?  The US has topped the charts for worst GHG emitters per capita on the planet for the past 150 years straight.  We are the world's foremost cause of climate change.  But we Americans are better than the rest of the world, we're exceptional, which is why we've all decided to give up flying for vacations, give up driving SUVS, and we all agreed to limit our HVAC and hot water use to what's tolerable rather than what's perfect.  Oh and we've all limited our consumption of beef of course!

Wait... we've all done those things right?  It's not just me?  Nah, the vast majority of us have done absolutely none of those things because we're Americans, exceptional Americans!  We're the best.  We're the good.

How about modern wars since WWII?  Vietnam.  Korean.  Iraq.  Afghanistan.  Ukraine.  Israel/Gaza (a genocide, not a war).  The US has either directly taken part in these, or has at least had their hands in all of them.  We're exceptional at war and killing.  Our military spending is more than the next 10 largest military spending nations!

We also have a long history of foreign regime changes to those who are more willing to support our bid to mine / buy their resources... can't forget about that!

Oh right right, it's not our international or planetary policy that makes us exceptional... it's our social policy!  A history of slavery and civil rights violations, but that's in the past.  We're not currently still dealing with racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and sexism!  We're far too exceptional for that. /s  

When Democrats, the party of good, had a super majority, the last time being in 2009 during Obama, they couldn't be bothered with codifying abortion rights, or real single payer universal healthcare, or reparations for ancestors of slaves, or immigration policy, or even helping the little guy instead of corporations during a recession.  They did pass Obamacare real fast though, which seems to have done almost nothing to control our healthcare costs that are among the highest in the world.

How about this election... it seems we've elected Trump again, a geriatric convicted felon, rapist, fraud businessman who in his last term attempted to lead an insurrection and destroy US Democracy, and whom his own administration cabinet doesn't support.  Funny enough, as far as I can tell, many of his supporters don't even care about politics or know anything about actual policy... many are literally just voting for him to troll the US and the liberals / establishment / elite.  They're upset, they're angry, and they want to own the libs / establishment.  That's the extent of it of their justification for voting Trump.  That's a sign of being exceptional, FYI...

Oh right, Democracy... THAT's what truly makes us exceptional.  Except that the electoral college is clearly corrupt, and our winner take all system is also easily corrupted to give results that aren't representative of the voter demographics, whether districts are gerrymandered or not.  Other nations do representation far better than us, where every vote truly matters.  In the US, if your district votes 50.01% to 49.99%, and you're on the 49.99% side, your vote automatically gets counted as going to the other candidate as if you supported and voted for them and their policies.  Isn't that nice everyone?!

Meanwhile, those people who fight against the two party system, and for real change, or stand up to a given party and demand changes, they're listed as the problem by the status quo voters.  Those that have continuously voted for the status quo, leading to the US largely stagnating in social policy while our politicians fleece us financially by passing every policy the corporations and super wealthy want them too, they're the folks who are clearly the most exceptional.

I get it, I see why Jon wants to push a message of hope... but his message of hope is based on the misguided idea that the US is actually exceptional.  It's not.  If anything, the US has been a virus on this planet... completely engulfed by personal greed and a capitalistic system that has us living outside of the bounds of what this planet and its life and people can sustain.  If we're exceptional at anything, it's exceptional at taking and destroying.

I look at my fellow countrymen worse now and that's what makes me sad. I could understand voting for Trump in 2016, it was an FU to politics and politicians by a people struggling and feeling unheard. Maybe even 2020, harder to define but ok. But after he lost and tried like hell to have people steal the presidency for him. He wanted Pence to just declare him president, install fake electors, called up states to ""Find me the votes"" after all that, people think he deserves a second go around. That's what's keeping me up. 

America would elect someone who would tear up the constitution for self gain because they think the price of eggs is too high. That little push we need to potentially elect the world's next monster is so small it's haunting.

"What's has been frustrating to me this election cycle is just how short people's memories are, how unaware of the rest of the world American voters are, and how people think that globe-spanning complex issues can be solved instantly and anyone who can't solve it them literally overnight has ""failed"".

I can't tell you how many voter interviews I've seen and *real actual people I've talked to* who said ""yeah I don't like the way Trump talks, but everything was cheaper when he was president."" And that is literally where the thinking stops. I'm not joking, that is the end of it. There is no critical thought about *why* or *how* prices changed. There is no recognition of economic trends. There is no consideration of other policies - maaaaybe immigration depending on their media diet.

Everything about sexism, racism, etc yes that can be true of his base and makes up contributing factors. But the people who actually decide the election are the ones who might swing either way or who might need to be convinced whether or not to vote; to soooooo many of them the election boiled down to ""eggs are expensive now and they weren't before"".

Nevermind that the whole world experienced inflation. Nevermind that that cost of living has gone up everywhere (I'm currently living in Canada, CoL is *much* higher here than where I lived in the States - is that Biden's fault too?). What matters is that when Trump was president things were cheap and when Biden was president things were expensive, so if Trump is president again things will be cheap again. Nevermind that the events which *led* to this happened under Trump, because again the electorate literally cannot comprehend that anything can happen on a timescale beyond a couple days (slight /s).

I'm not downplaying people's struggles - shit is expensive right now. It can be hard to get by. And part of me wants to be charitable because it is *hard* to try and understand politics when you are trying to feed your family while your bills go up faster than than your paycheck. But for too many people they began to feel the economic aftereffects of covid during Biden's term, and Biden couldn't stop global inflation instantly with a single word so he failed.

"We are feeling the effects of global warming right now, and the people hit hardest (Texas, Florida) went even farther right because they think that the Democrats are responsible for some reason.  I don't think his actions toward hastening the end of the world with climate change are something that Republican voters will understand even as they lose their homes again, and again, and again, and food prices climb because yields are lower.  Once potable water becomes more scarce, MAYBE they will budge, but by that time I don't know if we stand a chance of continued existence on this planet without a huge die-off.

States with abortion bans have been seeing plenty of women dying and reduced access to healthcare (especially emergency and pre-natal healthcare).  That's already being felt pretty hard and those states still went right.

The economy will be OK for the next couple years as the Democrat policies continue.  His economic disaster is unlikely to be felt for 3-4 years or slightly longer.  This is going to be a problem blamed on whomever follows him (just as the economic fall-out from his disastrous Covid response was blamed on Biden, how the mortgage collapse was blamed on Obama, etc.).  This happens every cycle - Republicans inherit a thriving economy and tank it, Democrats come in to a mess and fix it, but the fall-out of either doesn't really become apparent until into the next term.  Trump, with a 4-year break, will make all of the problems worse, but that's probably going to be blamed squarely on Biden.

The cruelty is the fun part with the deportations, so I don't think that's going to sway MAGA at all.

Europe is on the other side of the globe - American nationalists don't care.

"Article:

Former President Obama on Tuesday urged the country to be patient as election workers count ballots to determine the results of the election.

“It took several days to count every ballot in 2020, and it’s very likely we won’t know the outcome tonight either,” Obama wrote on the social platform X.

Obama encouraged the public to “keep a few things in mind as you make your voice heard today.”

First, he said to remember that “thousands of election workers around the country are working hard today,” adding, “Respect them. Thank them.”

“Don’t share things before checking your sources,” he added.

And finally, “Let the process run its course. It takes time to count every ballot.”

More than 82 million voters cast early ballots this year, which is slightly more than half the total turnout in the presidential election in 2020, according to The Associated Press.

States have different rules dictating when and how ballots must be counted. Some states have changed their rules since 2020, which could change the timing of when results come in.

In 2020, the race was not officially called for days after the election, leading experts to preemptively warn the public against expecting to know the results of the race on Tuesday night. Experts also warn that early poll returns do not necessarily indicate the trajectory of the entire election.

Vice President Harris and former President Trump are entering Election Day in what polls indicate could be the closest race in recent history.

According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling aggregate, Trump and Harris are tied nationally, with 48.4 percent support each.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"It looks likely that Trump has won.

The basic truth is this: Capitalism has failed to provide prosperity for everyone. People have struggled for years and the government as we know it now, just was unresponsive. People gave government “one last chance” with Obama and with “Hope and Change”. But nothing did… people still had less money and less opportunity. Trump came in and listened to those people and those people now, have selected an autocrat to make things right.

Whether Trump will, is another question. Personally, I think we are seeing the end of an Era. The Golden Age of American prosperity is gone. We are now in America’s Dark Age. Where ignorance reigns and persecution is the rule of law.

Trump won, but the US has lost. Americans are about to enter extremely hard times. Because Trump really doesn’t have the answers.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

when you add into how addicted most are to their phones and screens, and what appears to be a severe decline in intelligence when you look and listen to teachers talking about how much students are struggling in schools with basic reading and math, it paints a not great picture for American’s youth becoming dumber and dumber, feeding the uneducated into a pipeline where they’ll listen to people like Musk, Rogan, or Trump and just buy into their bullshit.

"We have to realize that **we misunderstood millennials and Gen Z men.**

We thought they were going to be the informed, connected generation with whom messages around love and empathy would engage them. 

That has good effects with educated women, but that’s not what the millennial and Gen Z men want. **They want unapologetic boldness and contrarianism.**

Thats people like Joe Rogan, Pat Macafee, Aaron Rodgers, Jake Paul, etc. We cannot deny that those types of people are massively influential with young men.

The common message that they have that aligns with Trump is “they may not be right, but I respect that they have the boldness to say what they believe and confront and question everything.”

If democrats can tap into that feeling, they’ll dominate. Until then, Trump, Boebert, DeSantis, Cruz and countless like them will continue to own that message and keep winning with it.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

And I hated that I, as a Millennial (late-30s), thought that. Because that's how Boomers treat(ed) us.

But I have a couple of close GenZ friends. And I see the almost absolute apathy they have. I had to convince both of them to vote in 2020. One of them still wasn't (""Why what's the point? Nothing changes.""), until his dad literally dragged his ass to the polls with him. This year they voted without me needing to harass them, but still asked them a few times, ""You guys are planning to vote...right? OK, just making sure.""

Which is in such contrast to what my friends and I were like when we were their age, mid 20s. We were idealistic, thought that we could change the world, etc. We were excited to vote. Well, not everyone always voted; I've always been an outlier. But regardless, we wanted change. And even though we're older and more jaded now, I feel like Millennials largely still have that spark in them. Though maybe I'm just biased.

They are terrible at messaging about the economy when every data point shows they are the better choice and it is starting to erode their base. And polling clearly shows that social issues do not translate to democrats votes if a referendum in Florida can get 55+% but Trump wins by 10 it is a losing issue. 

Dems need to radically change messaging focus on the economy and stop ignoring any area that of not a major city, a suburb.

Long-time Democrat voters remember all the shit the ousted Republicans did. You're not going to win over the people who think you'll govern like a conservative by promising a Republican a cabinet seat. Likewise, dropping policies your party prefers in pursuit of imaginary rogue voters from the other party isn't going to motivate your party. They wanted to straddle the line of pro-abortion and anti-abortion, which isn't assuring to people on either side of the issue. If you're one of the people who didn't want to vote over Gaza, and you're hesitant to vote for her because you believe Biden has enabled the war, an endorsement from the architect of the War on Terror is not reassuring.

Whatever.

The fact that these delusions are so blatant this time around just lends credence to the theory. People turned out for Biden but not Harris. They're as close as the same as it gets. Except for her gender and race...

And just anecdotally. People will do anything to mental gymnastics away sexism. A lot of guys straight up get offended when you imply women have problems in this country? It's crazy. I guess they see it as the suffering olympics. For example I'll talk about how women have worse outcomes in medicine, how doctors STATISTICALLY believe women less often... and men will deny doctors have a problem. Even though the statistics prove there is sexism in medicine. They don't want to believe it. They say ""well I had a doctor dismiss me once, so it's not a gender thing."" Not understanding what ""statistically more likely"" means. It's frustrating.

"There is no good way to look at it other than most of America chose to be both selfish and cynical, and I include a substantial amount of non-voters in this.

To me this is no longer a reflection of how many voted for Trump. He's going to get about the same or less than 2020. That was honest to god a very beatable total. It's a damning repetition of 2014, where not enough people cared to listen to basic facts and stop the worst from happening. Where Democratic leaning people who knew better decided to be angry and cynical more than listen to their better nature. Trump's base didn't change much, About 40% of the nation chose to not care about it at all.

Harris did very little wrong. The Dem activists who campaigned for her did very little wrong. Social media is already a mess of people blaming one another, arguing over the middle east, race, gender all of it, and I've shared both progressive and ""moderate"" views on all these issues throughout my life.

"I don't understand how but he's going to win. I thought for sure enough people in this country wouldn't want someone like him again. He's only gotten worse and worse the last four years but he's surged this election and all this support, energy, and enthusiasm for Harris has translated to an absolute cathartic result.

I'm really not sure what to make of this. It's not that it wasn't always a close race but I don't get the wild margins Trump is winning by. Millions of votes in FL and TX and hundreds of thousands in other places, making up huge margin gains in New York. It's like Trump magically gained 10% of the population's vote despite the insurrection, the felonies, and everything else.

I had more faith in our country but history is doomed to repeat itself. This is going to be an election with ripple effects for a generation.

Edit: There was no magic 10%. Trump performed just as he did in 2020. It was the Democratic vote that didn't show up by the millions. That should be a wake up call that Democrats didn't have the pulse of the nation and Harris didn't have the support we were led to believe.

It does not matter her politics or policy, or that abortion was on the ballot. She is a woman and they don't like her. It should be mentioned there are tons of men that think the same. More so. 

2. Trump provided an immediate enemy. He ran on immigrants being bad. Whether you agree or disagree it does not matter as Harris failed to provide and immediate external threat to the public (outside of Trump) and instead ran on ""Not Going Back"". The public is angry and is seeing everyday in their social media feeds that influencers are living lavishly and billionaires are going to space. They want a concrete enemy. The DNC has failed spectacularly in providing this while the right literally names boogey men who can be vilified by the public. 

3. The media. They never took Trump seriously. Sane washed him. Add to that the largest megaphones are conservative...

My biggest takeaway from this election is that we are officially in an oligarchy. We may be sliding into an illiberal democracy, but you can bet that every billionaire took notice at what Bezos, Musk, and Thiel did and they will most certainly do the same in all elections for the next generation or two.

It doesn't help that the media doesn't have any balls to tell it like it is. It's all click bait and hyper angering and doom scroll material with no accuracy or truth. Just optimising for ad revenue from both sides.

I've watched all of Trump's rallies and NONE of them showed any evidence that this man was sane or capable of doing anything better than the last time. And this was me disregarding all of his earlier shenanigans during COVID that got millions of people killed.

"Actually these two things helped to undermine democracy in the USA! 

1) the Removal of the Fairness doctrine in 1987 which originally was a policy introduced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1949, aimed at ensuring that broadcasters presented contrasting viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance. The doctrine required broadcasters to provide fair coverage of all sides of a public issue. It was officially abolished by the FCC in 1987.

2) Permitting corporate funding of political candidates, the landmark Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010 significantly changed the landscape of campaign finance in the United States. The Court ruled that corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited under the First Amendment. This decision effectively allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, leading to the rise of Super PACs (Political Action Committees).

I would add a third important decision by the Supreme Court helped to chip away at democracy and pave way to autocracy.  The Court declared that a President is immune from prosecution when exercising the ‘core powers’ of the presidency. The ambiguity or interpretation of core powers will be determined.

> About a dozen Donald Trump campaign aides spoke to Tim Alberta, a staff writer at The Atlantic, about how their candidate strayed from a hitherto on-message campaign to embark on a series of offensive, threatening and self-defeating verbal adventures that have left his team utterly demoralized heading into Election Day.

> “I think that there is a real fear that the bottom [of Trump's campaign] has started to fall out here at the worst possible moment and that they are closing in about as weak a fashion as you possibly could,” Alberta said. Many aides in the Trump campaign, he added, feel like they're ""crawling or limping through the [finish line] tape,"" and they know exactly who to blame.

"There is an extremely loud minority on the left that is perpetually online and thinks that every Democrat believes exactly as they do. 

This happens on the right as well on sites like X. 

There was a massive miscalculation made by the Harris campaign in which they hired people that were also too online, and that resulted in Harris losing the moderate vote. 

Trump ran to the middle at the beginning of his campaign, and Harris rushed to do the same with a lot less time to campaign. 

Trump is now winning in a landslide, and he is winning the popular vote right now by over 5 million votes. 

I think this was mostly a binary choice on economic and foreign policy issues. Harris pushed abortion, but people care about living costs and war more than that. 

No matter the reasons for the economy, Harris had to dig herself out of a hole on the issue. With foreign policy she had the Afghan pullout and wars in Israel and Ukraine to overcome. 

Democrats need to take a step back and decide their way forward, because looking forward at the 2030 census is bad for them. You are looking at a minimum 12 electoral votes being moved from blue states to solid red states due to population migration.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"A mostly on-point, albeit inherently national media sane-washed, summation of Donald Trump’s 714-day coast-to-coast Stay Out Of Jail tour (formally, his 2024 presidential campaign, announced Nov. 22, 2022)

> Over the course of the 2024 contest, Trump railed against undocumented immigrants, standing on a debate stage and falsely accusing Haitian migrants of stealing and eating their neighbors’ cats and dogs. He mocked Biden for being old and mentally infirm, and he repeatedly mispronounced Harris’s name and insulted her intelligence. At times, he echoed rhetoric from Nazi Germany and, more recently, falsely declared himself “the father of IVF” and promised to protect women, “whether the women like it or not.”

> A week ago Sunday, at what was supposed to be his triumphant Madison Square Garden rally in a city that had never fully accepted him, Trump’s speech was overshadowed by a comedian who appeared before him and described Puerto Rico as “a floating island of garbage.” Trump was livid, saying the comment — and ensuing days of negative headlines — was an unforced error in the final days, two people close to him said.

> Yet for much of the campaign, Trump offered a message of xenophobia and misogyny and racism, of cruelty and darkness and hate. If he wins, it will be because enough of the nation embraced that message, too. And if he loses, it will be because enough of the nation voted against that message — and Trump himself.

"The *only* topic he managed to touch on that had *any* meaning to actual voters is the immigration issue. To say that there remains a significant problem with illegal entry and illegal overstays isn't inherently wrong. This problem does exist, and even Harris' campaign  has acknowledged it. 

But Trump's problem was a) not mentioning that *he* was the reason Congress didn't pass the immigration bill that would have addressed this issue, and b) he chose to frame it as ""ALL those brown immigrants you see are evil dog-eating illegals and I'm going to DEPORT THEM ALL!!!1!"" which, I believe, alienated more voters than it gained.

In literally every other topic, he bombed spectacularly, or didn't address at all. He spent much of his time ""weaving"" stories about fictional serial killers or bitching about microphones. None of this was helpful, and none of this could have gained any more voters than turned out for him in 2020 when he was the incumbent.

-Fellated a microphone.

-Referenced his lowest political moment (the Access Hollywood tape) in a speech. Needlessly reminding everyone what a rapey douchebag he is.

-Called Nancy Pelosci and Michelle Obama a bitch.

-Said he wouldn’t mind if someone shot the reporters and media crew at his rally.

-Felt the need to ensure everyone he had never read Mein Kamph. (It’s ok, we know Donald. We have tape of your best friend for 10 years Jeffery Epstein saying you are functionally illiterate.)

-Declared voter fraud without evidence again.

-Tried to own Biden calling him garbage by failing miserably to open a garbage truck door, simultaneously displaying his age, stupidity and incompetence.

It was a historic campaign. The worst campaign in US presidential history and the results will show it. Don’t be surprised when his reasoning for the eLeCtIoN bEiNg sToLeN is that some polls showed him leading or at least close when the reality is that it will be a total blowout in Harris’s favor.

don’t get me wrong, kamala is the lesser evil (imo), and it’s a strong sigh of relief if she does become president. that doesn’t neglect the fact that she has evil motivations.

she has made it to the top position in the corrupt swamp of politics. she, as other politicians perfect the art of the con until they make it as top dog. it looks like she is now top dog.

"Every sane (and half sane) person knew Harris was a terrible candidate, yet this entire website, but particularly this sub, acted as her main cheer squad on the internet. 

The Democrats are now looking at losing perhaps 7 senators, as well as the White House. Not looking like they'll gain the house, either. This is all on Harris and the brain-dead idiots who blindly accepted the VP with a \~20% approval rating as the Democrat nominee without any push back. 

Had the party membership pushed hard and loud for a real primary to replace Biden, Harris isn't the nominee. Literally anyone else who expressed interest couldn't have done worse than Harris. She looks likely to have lost every swing state, a bunch of senators, and turned a quite a few deep blue states a much lighter shade of blue in the process. She lost Florida by a larger margin than she won New York and Illinois, for fuck's sake.

This would have been a Reagan-esque wipe out for the Democrats had the GOP nominated Haley. Vance definitely helped Trump by being young, well spoken, a veteran, and having blue-collar credentials, but Trump is still Trump. Harris is genuinely worse than Mondale.

"I hesitate to say this before polls close, but people are decided... 

I would agree he's cynically made no effort to put forward a platform. He has no ideas. He's lazily and impulsively taken to his podium and rambled aimlessly with low energy for months and months. His ramblings center on his own ego and id, as they always have. He's insulted and threatened people, public and private. He's disgraced himself, which has become all too normal and accepted for his campaigns. 

Worst in history. Yes. Somehow trumping his own ugly, deranged performances in the past. 

But you're giving her a little too much credit. Kamala has applied herself competently. She's avoided gaffes. She's pulled together policy agendas in relatively short time in reaction to being handed the baton mid-season. All that is commendable.

However, that's not the best campaign in history. You're getting carried away. 

Obama was quite a bit more effective at winning hearts and minds. He didn't have the benefit of his opponent being the most repugnant human being on earth. He hadn't been VP for 4 years. He was the underdog and rose meteorically because of his rhetorical skill, his agreeable, common sense and sensible persona, and a massively innovative campaign leveraging the internet (during the onset of Web 2.0 days) in unprecedented ways, basically writing a new playbook for every political campaign of the following 18 years. His team combined data science and grassroots mobilization and globally recognizable branding to get our first African American president elected. He was a fucking rock star.

Kamala hasn't come anywhere close to that. She's borrowed some of those moves, which have been refined over almost 2 decades, and she's wisely followed his lead in approaching controversial issues with caution and consideration. But she has barely broken through all the noise Trump creates. She's going to be a great President (assuming the country doesn't fuck this up) but she's largely being propelled by people's hatred of Trump because even though she has made the effort to explain what she stands for, most people don't feel like they've heard her. And that's not the best campaign ever. It's unique due to circumstances, but it's not superlative.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

He needs his supporters to feel heard, to feel angry, and to feel empowered. He needs to come across as irreverent, as disrespectful, and as a transgressive antihero. He’s done well by all of these intentionally low standards. If he loses, a frightening number of people are still going to be hungry for someone that delivers on these metrics.  ",2024_11_07,00_28_37

He was sunk because the DNC establishment wanted their candidate.

Similarly, I think Biden's cognitive decline was hidden until after the primaries and then he was thrown to the wolves because the powers that be wanted their own candidate. If Biden was removed earlier (or decided to step aside), I think RFK would've swept the floor with someone like Kamala. She did horribly in her first attempt.

They had 4 years to secure things and prevent this from happening. And just fumbled. 

- Didn’t invite Elon to electric car conversations lol. Pushed him right. Stupid mistake. 
- Terrible border policies. Just terrible.
- No ability to end wars
- Left interest rates too high for too long and suffocated the economy 
- Didn’t have a real primary. Played games with RFK’s campaign worse than they did with Bernie. Pushed him to Trump. 
- Ran biden when clearly he wasn’t great. And then snuck Kamala in with no primary. 
- Kamala sucked at campaigning. Didn’t go on podcasts. Didn’t have any clear policies. Kept saying she will allow new companies to deduct 50k. That was like her only vocal policy which made no sense. 
- Democratic mayors and governors just suck to allow migrants and homeless to take over cities. Total chaos. And then throwing so many free benefits toward them while regular Americans got pinched. Just terrible. 
- Backing trans men in women sports is just against common sense
- Vaccine mandates for healthcare workers who already had COVID. Dumb
- Defund the police. Just terrible policy. Shitting on cops while crime is high lol. 

Democrats did this. The entire democratic leadership needs to be shown the exit and a fresh more common sense group needs to take over.

You could say the same about this sub lol trump is 100% winning but if you only look at this sub you'll think Harris won by a landslide,2024_11_07,00_28_37
I think it’s more cause they called 2016 states so early for Hillary and their jaws were on the floor at the end of that race.,2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Queens, the most diverse area of the entire country where there are more than 200 languages spoken, shifted right by TWENTY ONE points. I live here, many long time NYers and immigrant communities are very, very angry about what they have seen as unchecked immigration. 

There’s also a sentiment that Dems refuse to listen to voters. E.g. the denial (on Reddit this was EVERYWHERE) that Biden was too old and unfit. The “people who don’t vote for Dems are all racist, sexist shitheads”. Maybe actually listen to voters and how they’re feeling.   
  
She lost major ground across most PoC groups and Trump gained big in those areas. Not to mention the male issue. Young men see women getting college degrees at a 2:1 rate, women out earning men, and dems refuse to speak to them.  
   
Astead Herndon of the NYT did a thanksgiving ep last year with his black family in Chicago, and the young males he spoke to were pro Trump because they felt that Dems were all about black women, but nothing for men.  
   
This is a crazy result, and the answer is not retreating to an echo chamber, the Dems need to shift hard.  
   
Also, NJ is nearly a swing state now. Trump lost by just 4.7 points. Goodness.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"I don’t think it’s totally unreasonable. VA was always very likely to stay blue, and it’s gunna be primarily democrat votes coming in later on as the more urban areas finish their count.

As of 10:15 EST it’s basically a dead tie in VA with 68% of the vote, and you can expect democrats to continue growing more quickly",2024_11_07,00_28_37

Hillary and Biden were both centrist, corporate-friendly assholes and Kamala outright refused to move to the left of that out of fear of losing moderate Republicans who were not gonna vote for her anyway.  I know reddit has enjoyed her campaign but honestly, the moment she decided to drop the ""weird"" label as part of their messaging, it was them giving up doing anything different that would get people excited again.

"Biden was never supposed to be a two term president, just a buffer until the Dems could find a suitable candidate. He was the candidate in 2020 because he had a good shot of winning again Trump since he was Obama’s VP and he wasn’t seen as a very extreme democrat so he could appeal to a lot of voters.

But instead of sticking with their plan the Democrats decided to let him run for reelection and come the summer his mind was far too gone to make it. So once he was convinced to drop it went to Harris since she was the only person that really made any sense, being Biden’s VP. They took Obama’s VP and he won so take Biden’s VP and hope she can win.

But she is a terrible candidate, far worse than Biden was in 2020, far worse than Trump is, and somehow managed to perform worse than Hillary Clinton, who I thought was the worst Democratic candidate we’ve had since Mondale.

But in pretty much every single state she has done worse than Hillary. Trump is expected to win every swing state on the map and, while he didn’t win and wouldn’t have, got frighteningly close to Virginia and New Hampshire, and now I think the margin of victory in New York is under 10% for Harris. Single digits in New York is insane. She hardly won Minnesota, which is where her running mate is from. That should’ve been an easy win. I wonder how this election would’ve played out if she had chosen Josh Shapiro, though after this I’m imagining at best she gets PA and Trump gets MN.

And not only did she do worse in easy to win blue states, but Trump ended her in red ones. In 2016 and 2020, he won Texas by 9 points and 5.6 points respectively. This time, he won it by well over 10 points (I wanna say close to 15). Florida was even more insane, he flipped it in 2016 and won by 1.3 points, and won in 2020 by 3.4 points, and this time he won by 13 whole points.

He also has a very good chance right now at winning the popular vote, and the Senate has gone to Republicans, the presidency has gone to republicans, and the house is close but it could very well go red majority. This was a landslide victory for Republicans and Trump, and she was destroyed.

Outside of the results, the only thing I know now is that the careers of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are virtually over.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

And would anyone upset about that messaging be happy with such insanely targeted policies like tax breaks for small business startups, or vague statements like saying we need an ""opportunity economy""? This messaging was terrible and I can understand why people would feel unenthusiastic even if I personally still wanted her to win over Trump.

John Deaton, the person that ran against her, alleged she gave Gary Gensler, SEC chair, questions ahead of time of a senate hearing.

> WILMINGTON, Del. - Delaware state Sen. Sarah McBride won the state&#039;s only House seat Tuesday, NBC News projects, making her the first openly transgender person elected to Congress.

> Jake Carpenter, 42, works in finance for a college near Lincoln, Delaware, and said he met McBride at a meet and greet in August, when he asked her, &quot;What have you promised, and how have you done it?&quot; She walked him through the policies she worked on in the state Senate, and &quot;She won me over,&quot; he said.

> McBride said that while she was voting Tuesday, she was reflecting on how powerful it was to vote for Kamala Harris for president; Lisa Blunt Rochester, who won her Senate race and will become the first woman and first Black person to represent Delaware in the Senate; and then herself.

Democrats tried to sidestep the economic issues and failed altogether to hit super important points like the fact that Trump was the one to spark the economic mess by accruing a $7 trillion debt. How could that NOT have drastic consequences?  Yet, this was barely mentioned in Dem campaign ads, which consistently only made vague references to the ways Kamala would fix the problem. 

Meanwhile, the Republicans spent a veritable fortune on anti-trans ads and ads that fed on the problems caused by migrants.  Democrats had a very poor handle on the pulse of the nation; they blew it by not understanding that the vast majority of Americans are terrified of migrants and vehemently do not support the trans community.  People care about their pocketbooks; they don’t give a crap that migrants come here to escape horrific conditions in their countries of origin or that trans people want hormone therapy and surgeries. This is laughable to most people and only likely to incite anger. The Republicans recognized this while the Dems apparently did not. They have four years to acknowledge these facts and plan accordingly — assuming there will even be a democratic voting process left in four years. People are likely to challenge this statement but by doing so, they only push the issues deeper under the carpet, from which they will re-emerge in ugly ways if not properly managed and addressed.  

Meanwhile, Musk (seeking to escape prosecution for statutory rape) goes on TV and rants and raves about these issues and gets everyone fired up while somehow managing to make everybody forget about his true motivation and emerges as a brilliant tactician (not to mention $12 billion richer this morning).

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-president-project-2025_n_6725104ae4b00acf55d9c521

“On the very first pages of Project 2025, the authors equate being transgender with “pornography” and declare it should be outlawed. Under Project 2025, the newly named Department of Life would be required to take a “biblically based” stance that families consist of a married mother and father, and the agency would make it easier for religious adoption and foster care services to refuse to work with LGBTQ+ couples. The plan also takes aim at various legal precedents and policies that have protected and expanded LGBTQ+ rights over the last decade. Project 2025 recommends reversing the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which protects LGBTQ+ people from workplace discrimination and has served as the foundation for cases involving gender identity. It further supports eliminating the promotion of gender-affirming care for minors nationwide.
Several states have enacted policies that provide a glimpse of what Project 2025 would look like on the national level. In Texas, one city recently banned trans people from using public restrooms that don’t match the sex assigned to them at birth, and the state’s attorney general has sued two doctors who provide pediatric trans health care. Several other states have made it nearly impossible for trans people to update their gender marker on driver’s licenses or birth certificates, and the future of gender-affirming care for all people rests upon an upcoming Supreme Court challenge of a Tennessee law. Legal experts have warned that Trump’s victory, and a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, could mean few roadblocks to stop him from making Project 2025’s vision of torching civil liberties of LGBTQ+ people into a reality.”",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Back when I was a Democrat, we were trying to get gay marriage to be legal. Trans wasn’t even a thing (let alone a political issue), and if it had been, 90+% of Democrats would have been against it.

Today, over 20 years later, pretty much everyone on both sides of the aisle accepts gay marriage, and trans rights is the issue Dems are pushing for.

Maybe in 20+ years you will have a similar reaction to those trying to legalize pedophilia.

If you think giving kids puberty blockers is acceptable, why not also allow them to freely engage in sexual intercourse? Both will leave long-term scars, just of a different nature.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

Anyway fun anecdotes aside the most common usage of this term now isn’t some hot take down of sexism. It’s basically a meme started by drag queens. And peddled on social media. Completely irrelevant for the most part. But I don’t know the OP maybe they are crazy and legitimately think there was some mustache twiddling super villain scheme in a naming convention 🤷🏼‍♂️.

I was just saying that I think it's important to celebrate trans achievements, and yes, it may not matter to most people, but then they shouldn't care about this news, for them, it would just be another new person in Congress. If they're uncomfortable with the word ""transgender,"" they're unlikely to vote Democrat. How did I help Trump win?

"Trans people have never existed anywhere near on the scale that we see today. That is a pretty easily verifiable fact.

It is a bizarre social contagion. You have to be a “dumbass” to not see it for what it is.

Your comment regarding equating genuine medical use with voluntary use is just patently stupid. Even in some very liberal countries, the use of puberty blockers as treatment for trans teens has ceased. The data is just not there to conclusively prove that this should be the standard treatment method.

I can assure you that there are many doctors who believe that this puberty blocker thing is absolute insanity. Case in point, my aunt is a retired pediatrician who specialized in reproductive development and growth disorders. She voted for Harris. But, this is one of the issues she vehemently disagrees with the Democrats on. But I guess she is just a dumbass, right?",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"No, it did, there was polling on it.

If you are OK with that, I guess keep doing the same thing.

It is clear that the activists have done far more harm than good, upending a long-term trend of greater acceptance.  This is likely because of silly positions on female sports, school excesses, and the constant emotional-blackmail about children leading to a massive uptick in sterilization.

Meanwhile, regular trans adults have to watch acceptance roll back because certain male athletes decided they were super special and got to compete against females.  We see how that is working out for regular trans people...",2024_11_07,00_28_37

After you pump the trump make sure you dump the trump before you become a trump chump,2024_11_07,00_28_37
You should explain to all of us how it does work.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
That wasn’t their point. Read the rest of the sentence.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
"If I remember correctly, (don’t quote me) you have to notify the SEC at least 2 business days *before* selling shares, because you are considered “insiders”. This is specifically to prevent pump and dumps like the above commenters believe to be happening. Which from my investment experience, big wigs like directors and CEOs typically make big insider sales for tax purposes, not because they are getting out or the company is tanking. 

Contextually speaking, to add some validity to my case, you can actually check on [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/djt) to see the short interest for Trumps stock. Over an hour ago maybe around the time of the article, there were 0 shares available to short. What that means is, institutions borrowed every single share that was available to be borrowed, and sold them, because their outlook is that trump will lose the election resulting in his stock price crashing. So when they buy back the shares at a much lower price than when they sold, they pay what is owe and collect the difference. 

There is absolutely no fucking way in ANY parallel that trump is stupid enough to try and sell his shares the day of the election. He would have had to at the *LATEST*, inform the SEC on Friday, that he would be dumping shares today. Imagine if he fucking did that lmao.


Edit: If you already knew all this I apologize and did not mean to insult you.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Thanks for the reply. My question was a request to be informed of the SEC notification rules. You did a good job of explaining them. 

My understanding is that for member of Congress they can report after the fact so I wondered what the regulations were for Trump. 

Having the big players short the stock does not bode well for Trump's election chances.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"You mean highest, right?",2024_11_07,00_28_37
And you continue to miss the point.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
"Actually the big players are having their short position completely destroyed as we speak. DJT is currently up 38% (was 41% 5 mins ago) and he appears to be in a pretty decent lead. With Elon next to him, infamous in the investment world for price manipulation, the big wigs should definitely have known better than to try and bet against them. 

Back to your initial question, as Trump is not currently holding a position in office, but is a majority share holder of DJT, he is legally required to inform the SEC before making a big sale. This is the key distinct difference between the two. Scumbags like Pelosi can sell or trade and are not required to notify beforehand *unless* they are a majority shareholder. Meaning they own 10%+ of the company via shares. I believe because of the STOCK Act or some shit, Gov officials have up to like 40-50ish days to disclose their financial transactions. 

I imagine most Congressman would never pass that threshold cuz it would interfere with their insider dealings. Hell Nancy Pelosi has come really fucking close herself even recently. Offloading idk how many thousands of shares of VISA like 2 weeks before a DOJ probe hits and it shits itself. 

Now, having said that. If Trump *does* win, he is not allowed to manage his own investments including such things as DJT. It’s a conflict of interest and typically they are given over to a blind trust where somebody else manages the account for them; and in a lot of cases the person managing the account does not know who it actually belongs to, and vice versa. The person in charge of the President’s investments are unknown to almost everyone as well. I actually find it pretty fucking interesting tbh lol.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"It’s so simple, follow these steps to lose your money",2024_11_07,00_28_37
Don’t worry about it lol. Ignorance is bliss for some!,2024_11_07,00_28_37
I understand the point perfectly. OP said it's probably not him dumping his shares but rather other entities. This would be true of anyone who might be concerned about consequences but it's clear that Trump does not care about consequences as he has escaped any real consequences up to this point in time. Please explain why he would care about the SEC or anyone knowing at all given the current situation.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
Billionaires love this one simple trick,2024_11_07,00_28_37
"Because, if he filed with the SEC to announce he would be selling shares of DJT, the latest he could announce it would be Friday. Of last week. Now idk about your background as mine isn’t in politics, but to *me* it seems pretty no brainer to not announce to your shareholders and people that will be voting for you in the election, that you are in fact rug pulling them, *before* they vote. The possibility of them not being happy with that and changing their vote would be too high of a risk for him to take. Especially over some measly shares that were barely a percentage of his net worth 2 weeks ago. 

While normally I would agree with your sentiment of him not caring about the ramifications of his actions, in this specific instance it is entirely in his best interest to in fact give a fuck about ramifications of possible bad faith dealings.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

I am just depressed this election isn’t a landslide for Harris. Looks like nothing moved the needle for Trump support since 2020,2024_11_07,00_28_37

Something about the way the preferences are spread out across the country and the way the two sides tend to vote means there’s a ‘red mirage’ phenomenon early on that makes it look like the Rs will take it, then as the west coast checks in and more mail-in votes get counted the numbers swing back towards blue.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"No swing states called yet. The U.S. covers many time zones. So east coast states report and are called earlier, with states with smaller populations getting called first.

As larger counties and west coast states close their polling locations and report votes, the popular vote and electoral votes start to swing in the democrat’s favor.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
in the last election the early results heavily favored the republicans too.  This being due to the fact that states count the votes of the people who voted on voting day first and then count the ballots from the early voters.  So basically it's still far too early to tell if that trend will hold for the dems or not.,2024_11_07,00_28_37

0 have been called.,2024_11_07,00_28_37

This is pretty much to be expected so far.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"None and they won't be for a while. All the states that have been called are safe bets for each party so as soon as a reasonable number of votes are in, and as expected, they call those states.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

Missouri called it for trump with only like 25% counted.,2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Likely because huge blue counties have not reported a lot yet.

Georgia is interesting because a bomb threat to several strong blue counties forced them to keep the polls open a little longer.  I don’t know how much those blue counties have reported yet, but something like 25% of the vote still is out, likely in those blue counties.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"And Vermont gets called with 0% reporting. There are people very good at math that can calculate the very likely trajectory of outcomes. When they are close, they don’t call it. When they are obvious, they call it.

Calling Colorado is less about how much is reporting, and more about what data is available based on the amount of known data, and pre/post polling. The latter of which gets adjusted for corrections based on historical data.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

This is shown by the fact all the
Other elected officials from that area are Democrats and polling from that are is extremely lopsided.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"So a lot of if hinges on population centers. For example here in Pennsylvania, most areas go for Republicans but in cities where there are millions of voters vs a few hundred thousand in rural and suburbs, tend to go Democrat.

So in CO of those not counted, most are likely from cities where Democrats generally win by a larger margin.

In most states this is a common trend: rural areas tend to vote red for Republicans and urban areas and cities tend to vote blue for Democrats.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"In America, cities don't get proportional voting support resources.  So, people have to stand in line for hours and votes take forever to be counted.  

So, anything still to be counted will almost certainly for Harris",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"It's where the votes are still outstanding. The split between urban/progressive and rural/conservative is pretty stark in America. 

In other words, if lots of his vote is in and he's losing, he's fucked.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"He needed to do much better to have a remote chance against the TSUNAMI of democrat votes that will come in from the cities. This is part of why trump whines about voter fraud. The early vote is all from small counties because of course they can count faster- there’s like 10% of the votes of say Denver. 

If trump is trailing and all that’s left is heavily dem counties, then he has no shot.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"If the counties yet to report lean significantly dem, it’s probably considered near certain by their model.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

The areas that have been counted already are the low-population red-leaning areas. The votes remaining to be counted are from the densely-populated blue-leaning areas. Put that together and you can tell that Harris is only going to run up the score from here.,2024_11_07,00_28_37

You can't blame Biden for inflation in Greece.  But unfortunately the average American has about a 3rd grade education and zero critical thinking skills, combined with extreme propaganda from the country's largest news source.

"1. A list of Trump's actions that attacked public lands:  
    https://www.npca.org/articles/2171-the-undoing-of-our-public-lands-and-national-parks

    >President Trump and the officials he appointed systematically undermined, degraded and outright attacked the laws that protect our public lands, the agencies that manage them and the irreplaceable resources these places safeguard for the American people. 

2. https://www.americanprogress.org/article/anti-nature-president-u-s-history/  

    >President Trump has removed protections from more U.S. lands than President Teddy Roosevelt protected as parks and monuments.  

    >President Donald Trump has thrown in reverse the United States’ proud, bipartisan record of nature conservation. Unlike every modern-day U.S. president before him who helped build up America’s awe-inspiring system of public lands and waters, President Trump has pursued an agenda aimed at removing protections from vast swaths of public lands and waters. In fact, President Trump is the only president in U.S. history to have removed more public lands than he protected.

3. https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-2-0-would-bring-whiplash-to-interior-department/  

    >Former President Donald Trump has promised on the campaign trail to take a sledgehammer to the Biden administration’s energy and environmental policies.  That means the Interior Department — a vast agency that oversees public lands, the national parks, Western water conservation and endangered species protections — is sure to witness drastic policy shifts if Trump reclaims the White House in January.

4. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/sep/28/trump-oil-national-parks-wildlife-election  

    >Indeed, early plans suggest that Trump aims to radically remake the Department of the Interior, which oversees more than 500m acres (200m hectares) of public lands, manages the country’s national parks and wildlife refuges, and is responsible for protecting endangered species. Whereas Joe Biden made safeguarding public lands and the transition to green energy a centerpiece of his time in office, Trump and his allies would reverse many of Biden’s policies, remake the civil service and implement a new agenda focused on slashing regulations, weakening environmental protections, and expanding oil and gas development across the American west.

5. https://suwa.org/trumps-assault-utah-monuments-leaves-millions-acres-limbo/  

    >President Trump’s repeal of Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears National Monuments on December 4, 2017 represents the single greatest attack a president has ever launched against America’s federal public lands. With the stroke of a pen, Grand Staircase was slashed by 47 percent, with about 1 million acres remaining, and Bears Ears was decimated, its 1.35 million acres reduced by 83 percent to just 229,000 acres.

6. https://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/editorials/article294668454.html

"It's really what it comes down to when so many voters say that the economy is the number one issue for them.

By almost every traditional metric, the US economy is very strong and have been performing well at a steadily increasing pace over the years since the pandemic. You folks recovered industries from COVID and have managed to handle inflation faster and better than almost every other major economy. Wages are high, unemployment is low, businesses are thriving, stock market is doing great etc.. The statistics don't lie, and to claim the US economy is ""bad"" is to misunderstand macroeconomics.

But, as you very well point out, there's a lot of working and middle class Americans who aren't seeing this wealth. Their rents, mortgages, grocery and gas prices have gone up, and they're finding it tougher to manage their finances day to day. I think this is something Democrats have to understand in their messaging: telling people that they're wrong about the economy when their wallets are bleeding come across as arrogant and disdainful.

And the truth of the matter is, any Dem candidate would have to deal with this. Incumbents are getting crushed across the globe, largely due to unhappiness with inflation and rising costs. Had Trump been the incumbent, he'd have to deal with that blowback too (likely not as harshly though due to his extremely devoted base).",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Yes. Rural counties are more red and have lower populations so the votes are counted a lot faster than the dem leaning counties with large cities and high population. Pretty much always have more republican votes counted early and more democrat votes counted later. Same with mail in votes which are more likely to be democrat and some states don’t allow to be counted until all Election Day votes are counted, but that should be less extreme this time. And then in general polls close earlier on the east coast and there are more red states there

You can basically add about 80 EC votes to the dem candidate right away as the west coast has states that are deep blue and haven’t even started counting. Polls are closing there in like 30 minutes.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

Millennials were pretty evenly split with a slight edge for Harris. 49/48. 

Gen Z was the inverse of Gen X with 54/43 for Harris, but made up less than half the proportion of votes as Gen X. 65+ made up 28% of the vote, 45-64 made up the largest group at 35% of the total vote. 30-44 was 23%, and 18-29 was 14% of the vote.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

Listen to the new UK tories leader speak, Kemi Badenoch, and then listen to Kamala speak. There are no 'tactics' involved in putting up someone who can't answer any question without some rehearsed script running in their head. Especially when they can't get the script right

>In my role as Vice President, I mean, I’ve probably worked very hard at making sure that, umm, I am well versed on issues, and I think that is very important. It’s a mistake not to be well versed on an issue and feel compelled to answer a question.

I’m sure they’re going to love Trump when it comes to Muslim policy….,2024_11_07,00_28_37

"People are going to finger point for weeks and that’s fine, go nuts.          

  But my takeaway from this election is the only way for America to move forward is maximum pain. People need to feel pain and understand exactly who is doing it to them. Republicans need to cook for like two election cycles for people to understand that apathetically swinging the pendulum back and forth isn’t going to make anything better for them and protest votes/nonvotes get them exactly what they deserve.         

It’s cold and callous as fuck but that’s what America is. America deserves exploding deficits, America deserves their civil rights to be impeded, America deserves to lose their place as leader of the free world. We have been horrible stewards of all of it. So it is now time to pay up. 

 Edit: To all of those who disagree, pulling a lever for the good guys every two years isn’t a ticket to saying you did enough. We are a nation. When we, as a whole, can’t  teach and convince the masses to stay off of the darker path that’s on ALL of us. Sorry to fucking doom it up this morning but the time for doom has been thrusted upon us. We all share the blame for what happens next.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"We have one half of the country is clueless and doesn’t understand that what they voted for will not improve their lives nor get them the outcome they desire. It’s sad, but true, but I don’t know if they will ever learn. But perhaps if things get bad enough they might change their tune. 

There is blame to be shared: media for sane washing and normalizing the rhetoric, the double standard the two candidates were measured against. The amount of foreign interference and misinformation on social networks, news, and podcasts.  Our country is not as progressive as we thought and the Democratic Party needs to really rethink how they run for office, etc.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

This was never going to be a reliable voting block for the left they are often as conservative as Evangelicals. But they pretty much screwed themselves now instead of trying to work within the party where they had some Support and sympathy they decided burning it down was better.

"I was raised Muslim, did a lot canvassing Milwaukee, michigan, I chose Dearborn for the final few days, drove from Illinois to get there. Let me tell you I was lucky if I got 1 out 20 people to say MAYBE to Harris. Best I got was maybe, our Arab speaking canvassers had higher success rates, but still very difficult. I tried my best pitch how harris isn't only not a alternate non-evil option, but why she is a better shot for long term Palestine statehood. Nothing, lots of apathy, frustration, anger, especially Arab men, women at least would give me the 60 seconds to speak. I am very angry at this community and anyone who didn't vote Harris, period. It hurts extra when you have culture similarities and they don't trust you. But let me tell you, some or a lot of these people know a friend, family member, or friends friend that has been affected by israels atrocities in Gaza and Lebanon. I cannot just look past that even in my anger.  Canvassing Dearborn, MI was one of the most emotionally taxing and ""dangerous"" political or social activities I did. Worst I got was some verbal spats, but never anything physical (thank goodness).  I tried America. Writing this makes me almost wanna cry.  


P.s. the Dearborn office didn't open till last 3 weeks, apparently Harris campaign fought against it (possible lost cause, not sure? Reason), until some grassroots Muslim organizers pushed for it.

There are almost 2 BILLION Muslims in this world. There are roughly 20 million Jews.

Harris missed the mark entirely with the Arab vote.  She thought she could sell them a ceasefire, but it was never about the Palestinians.  Those same voters who stayed home yesterday know that Trump is going to give Israel a blank check to do whatever it wants to do to the Palestinians, up to and including literally murdering all X million of them.  The voters in Michigan do not give a shit.  What they really want is to extend their religious control over their own communities, the exact same thing Muslims do in every country they settle in.  Adapt western liberal values?  That doesn't comport with Islam; Sharia law does.

If the left actually truly valued the western liberal values it professes to believe in, the Democratic Party would be an expressly anti-Muslim party.  Islam is incompatible with western liberal values.  Period.  We do not need to be tolerant of intolerance.  And if there is any silver lining at all to this election, it is that there is now at least no more reason to keep pretending that Islam is not a massive problem for the west to deal with.  

I think people on the left will be shocked by how widely-supported Trump's eventual Muslim Ban II turns out to be.  The Democrats would be wise to read the room, especially now that Arab/Muslim voters have abandoned the party in the critical moment where they would have mattered.  Now they don't matter, and that can actually liberate the Democrats.

""I'm against any ideology that subjugates women"" is a much easier position than ""I'm generally in favor of equality for women under the law, however, I recognize that certain religious groups want inequality under the law, and I am not against those religious groups because to promote my own values would be intolerant of their contrary values, and I cannot be intolerant of intolerance.""",2024_11_07,00_28_37

But many traditional Muslims and Arab Americans have social views that are deeply conservative.  I guess enough time has passed, and they're starting to shift back to their conservative roots.

I'm considering making plans to move out of this state in the long run. Pennsylvania use to be reliably blue for years until the past couple of election cycles.

Not if they have one member undocumented in the family. The project 2025 guy has already said this.  Whole families.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
It’s not conceited.  It’s true and shows up in polls and population studies time and time again.  ‘Educated’ and ‘technologically literate’ are group descriptors without judgement.  The fact that those groups tend to skew liberal is a well-known fact.  Stop thinking about your feelings and look at the data.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
"Sure they do.  The vast majority did not think Harris was a shoe-in.  You can always select a few people’s thoughts and try to make a straw man out of it.

It rang of 2016, but given all the evidence that Trump is not a good person, I believed that most Americans would see that.

"Folks, remember:

1: Basically no major cities have reported in yet in most states - they're huge and take time outside a couple of exceptions. Harris is behind right now...and then NY will finish counting and suddenly she'll leap ahead, a few smaller states will finish and Trump will go back etc. etc. Happens all the time since like...FDR?

2: Florida was never really in play and this is specifically by design by the GOP; not only do they have a true believer in DeSantis but he has actively been trying to make the state a worse place in order to drive out anyone more liberal/progressive than a Confederate General. If it wasn't for all the tourist trap places setting up shop way back when, FL would probably be one of the poorest, most abandoned states in the US and they know it.

3: Everyone thought Biden was losing too; until he suddenly wasn't. Calm down.

**EDIT:** Point 4: This was always very likely to be a close election with a good chance of Trump legitimately winning, even if myself and others think he won't. When it's a razor's edge like this, little things going wrong (or right) can tip the balance, so best laid plans and all.

There were 2.384 million outstanding votes in NC.

1.193 million of those outstanding votes were in counties where Harris is leading with about 60% of the vote.

So about 50.05% of the outstanding vote are in democratic strongholds. It will be close, but I'm hopeful she'll pull through. Trumps lead will hopefully disappear as as the higher population areas that take longer to count come in.

"Email from Simon Rosenberg 11:41pm:

The Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon just released this statement:

Team,

As polls close across the country, I wanted to give everyone an update on what we’re seeing. As we have known all along, this is a razor thin race. Thanks to this amazing team, we have seen incredible turnout across the Battleground States, and the closeness of the race is exactly what we prepared for.

While we continue to see data trickle in from the Sun Belt states, we have known all along that our clearest path to 270 electoral votes lies through the Blue Wall states. And we feel good about what we’re seeing.

In Pennsylvania, we overperformed turnout expectations in Philadelphia, and overperformed in our early vote expectations in Bucks County. We don’t have Election Day results from Philadelphia, but we do know that we overperformed turnout expectations there, and have seen specially high turnout in places with large non-white and student populations. We expect to see higher turnout in Philadelphia than in 2020. Outside of Philadelphia, we have limited data on turnout and support right now, but what we do have is tracking with our expectations. We are awaiting more results (like everyone else!), and hope to get a closer read in the coming hours.

In Michigan, we are awaiting a significant amount of votes to come in. The City of Detroit won’t be reported out until roughly midnight, but we have seen strong turnout throughout early vote and Election Day there. Other results in Michigan are harder to parse, since results are coming in more piece-meal than elsewhere.

In Wisconsin, we know there is a significant amount of vote remaining in Dane and Milwaukee counties, and we are seeing signs of strong performance in the WOW counties, where we have partial data. We don’t expect complete results from Wisconsin until tomorrow morning between 3 am - 5 am.

Polls just closed in Nevada and Arizona so, as expected, it will be a while before we have more information from both states.

We’ve been saying for weeks that this race might not be called tonight. Those of you who were around in 2020 know this well: It takes time for all the votes to be counted – and all the votes will be counted. That’s how our system works. What we do know is this race is not going to come into focus until the early morning hours.

We’ll continue to keep you all updated as we get more information. This is what we’ve been built for, so let’s finish up what we have in front of us tonight, get some sleep, and get ready to close out strong tomorrow.

JOD",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Now we’re at the part of the election where everything starts to move real slow. So let’s break it down. 

The most sensible path for Harris to win (which was agreed upon by virtually all pollsters) is Maine, New Mexico, Nebraska-2, Virginia, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.

Virginia and New Mexico just called for Harris. 

Maine is absolutely crawling right now. We probably won’t get their results tonight. 

Michigan is not looking great but still a long ways to go. Still several hundred thousand votes in Wayne County that need counting. By no means time to panic. 

Pennsylvania is for Trump but he’s running out of votes. The vast majority of votes left are from the Philly metro, that will be at a minimum another +200,000 vote margin for Harris. There are still large Harris chunks in Pittsburgh and in Cambria County. Trump’s last gasp is York County- which has been a Republican stronghold for half a century. But Trump’s margin here so far is a fraction of what it was in 2020. I don’t know where the counted votes in York County have came from, but if this pattern continues, that would probably win Pennsylvania for Harris. But if the Philadelphia turnout was as high as advertised, she’s got it.

Minnesota will likely be called for Harris soon. She’s up almost 150,000 votes and we’re yet to count from Ramsey County yet. 

Despite being predicted to go to Republicans, NE-2 is looking good for Harris. She’s up 20,000 votes with most votes counted. 

Harris has a healthy lead in New Hampshire. About 26,000 votes. It should be enough but we’re still waiting on some Boston bedroom communities- namely Salem, Bedford, and Hudson. These usually lean Republican, but usually not by +10,000 vote margins, and Bedford flipped blue in 2020.

Wisconsin is a bit tricky because its precincts send results a bit at a time, so when it says that 76% of votes are counted, it means that approximately 76% of each county’s votes are counted. Some early and late of course but it’s a good bit more evenly spread than other states. Harris is down 100,000 votes. But there is one straggling county moving slower than the rest: Milwaukee. Conservatively, a +150,000 swing from Milwaukee’s remaining votes should help. 

But there’s a problem. When Biden won Wisconsin, he pulled decent support in two Republican-leaning suburban counties: Racine and Kenosha. He didn’t win them- he pulled roughly 47% in each, but that was enough to win the election. Harris is pulling 47% in Kenosha, but only 36% in Racine. If that trend doesn’t improve, it may be the election. 

If Wisconsin doesn’t move for Harris, the she must win both Arizona and Nevada. Nevada probably won’t be releasing counts for another few hours- most pollsters have it in a dead heat. Trump has about an 11,000 vote lead, but Harris is definitely in play. She’s putting up better percentages than Biden so far in Maricopa, Pima, and Coconino County- but I will caution that these counties are gigantic and it’s not easy to tell where these votes are coming from. 

So, to conclude. It’s not a disaster. It’s not what anyone hoped for. But it’s not a disaster. This was predicted to be a close race that would come down to the wire and that’s exactly what happened. 

We can talk about the vibes of this election and it’s importance, but at the end of the day it’s a game of turnout. And the turnout in several swing states- most particularly Georgia, were significantly lower than in 2020. That’s the problem",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"well all of you keyboard economic gurus that claim to know everything and literally have drank the Kool aid the Republican party has spread out since 2016.

You forgot that economy 101 class that no matter who is in charge what goes up must come down at some point 

Looking at the election results today it is sad that so many un educated people literally have fallen for the bait that the Republicans have put out 

The poor and working class will be impacted the most by all the changes this next group will bring 

not to mention they will deport millions of people many of them that came here legally because of the wars and certain death threats they faced 

Yet these same people are doing jobs that many lazy rich people will never do themselves 

But don't worry soon the working class will be working 60+ hours a week when overtime is done away with because they campaigned on no taxes on overtime. 

That is because overtime laws will be changed to ensure employers have workers and they are making money 

oh yeah another thing student loan forgiveness plans they will be gone for good and department of education will be eliminated 

Pell grants will also be done away with, if you don't have money to go college you will either take out private loan or just not attend. 

This nation today literally took a step backwards to like 1825 and no longer will women have a voice nor will minors 

Soon you will see laws changed to allow children as young as 14 working in factories again and it will be expected that if they are not wealthy that is what they are doing in their teens

I am so sorry for my children both of them that now are at legal draft age. 

It is very likely that in their lives that they will see the total collapse of this nation 

I am glad i only have maybe another decade or two to live as my health will never last working 60+ hours a week for twenty more years. 

I am turning 54 and already working two jobs to support my family and put one of them through some classes at local tech school. 

I am not rich by no means even working all that but now looking at  a convicted felon as our President and Republicans having majority the people like me that don't even make $79000 a year busting my tail will now have to work until like 75 or death",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"The media was complicit in Trump’s return and do not be fooled by any remorse you may read or hear about. They got rich off Trump and are happy he’s elected.

Do you remember your coverage of the first debate with Biden, where headlines were SCREAMING about him being mentally incompetent and old, and giving next to zero headline coverage about the thousands of things that Trump has done that were much, much worse? You and your owners are sacks of shit who I hope are the first to go if there is a revolution.

The press in this country, run by the richest assholes ever, are what is destroying us. They get away with telling blatant lies every single day. They only tell one side of a story, never both, they just ignore things they don't want ""their"" people to hear about.

"The media got drunk on their power during the pandemic, arguing that it was for the greater good to suppress discussion.

What really bothers me is I see so many on the left patting themselves on the back for being knowledgeable and rational, when it is impossible to have a discussion with them that explores even the slightest divergence from the current fashion in thought.

I predicted all the way back in summer of 2020 that eviction moratoriums would lead to an eventual and perpetual increase in rents of about 30%, absolutely destroying the lives of the lower 60% in income.

"The media is responsible for all of this in multiple ways.

Disinformation is widely available and in every corner of the internet. The only way to counter that is with posting facts, sources, etc. However the biggest failure of all has been the media. Can't really post a link to a Washington post article or some other website that has a paywall to view it. People are not going to pay you whatever you charge a month to view facts. People are just going to keep searching until one of the sites shows them information and most likely it could be a right wing or fake website. 

One of the things I was doing on TikTok this year was just that. Finding comments, posts full of disinformation and commenting, replying with screenshots or videos of the facts. Can't really do that when I would need to probably have $100+ a month loss in all the new orgs subscriptions. I tried my best to find free sources for information, but it's wild that a few times I can find the best article, but cannot actually view it.

But the media will most likely suffer the worst of this presidency. See the below link. This was from CPAC 2023 with Steve Bannon promising to usher in project 2025 and starts saying the days are numbered for a bunch of MSNBC reporters and calls them each out by name. WTF did he mean by that vague statement? Who the hell knows, he is out of jail and looking for revenge along with Trump, so you know he is already calling Trump to fulfill this wish list and Trump will honor it as Bannon went to jail for 6 months for Trump.

The latter is misinforming the living fuck out of people and it’s having a ripple effect impacting all kinds of shit, not even just politics.  The news does this too, the extent depends on which news sources they watch specifically.

Back to the topic of social media and people being terribly misinformed, (this is all anecdotal btw) I know some people in high up government positions who are seeing colleagues who should know better consuming all kinds of bullshit.  My friends have told me they’re greatly concerned about the future of this country if this continues and it will.  The level of stupid shit some of our own officials are consuming is wild.

I’ve been to physical therapy off and on throughout my life and so I’ve gotten kinda close with some PT’s.  In recent years I’ve heard crazy stories from therapists regarding growing amounts of people with health issues who think they’re going to cure their problems with supplements or some other nonsense.  Some instances were people with conditions like diabetes where they eventually put themselves in dangerous situations or even got themselves killed!  My PT’s were saying that while people have shown this behavior before, they have never seen it get this bad until recent years.

And then there’s people working in schools dealing with kids who are spewing nonsense as fact consuming tik tok’s or whatever it is they watch.  There’s stories like this everywhere and it’s only getting worse.  I’ve heard it from friends who are working in the education system, and there’s tons of discussions about this online.

This problem is pretty fucking massive and the trolls and those who wish to push this BS are outnumbering those who aren’t for this.  And I imagine there’s a lot of people like myself who gave up on social media platforms like Facebook which probably helped feed into the problem in the end as the number of bullshitters stays strong while those would try to oppose them have dwindled cause they’ve given up.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

Those two days of speeches were so emotional that even the boys were crying in class. I am 23 now and those words from the survivors will forever be cemented into my mind.

The fact that people think that his appreciation of Hitler is not a big deal, or even think it’s a good thing are absolutely despicable and completely deranged.

Dumb ass Democrats clung on to abortion like idiots when the writing on the wall was clear it's the economy stupid. 

Furthermore states like FLA an MO have demonstrated they can vote for trump while supporting abortion through state level referendums. 

For example FLAs got to 58npercent of a needed 60 to overturn the abortion ban there. And Missouri literally succeeded. 

Like trump said, abortion is not the firebrand issue the Dems though

And the vote shows that white women can vote based on their pocketbokk and still support abortion bans..further trump said NO National Ban and return the issue to states to decide. As he predicted and I mention some were more liberal than we assumed 


Then as a black man I think how in our circles we talk about reparations. The say No reparations the best I can do for you is abortion.  Abortion just isn't the big issue


2. The disregard for the Palestine issue. No explanation needed

3. No plan for migrants. Spends years calling trump racist and ignore calls tomshut down border only to have Biden do it in the last half of 24. Signalling republicans were right all along. 

4.  Then I think of young men. When I went to college in 2013, all that rape culture, toxic masculinity white privilege stuff was just coming out and we found it a little weird then too. Ten years later, kids who grew up with it from their toddler years to now are over it . Manospnere people and Rogan not feeling it. Young men went trump 

5. Latinos didn't care about trump attacks on migrants. The ones who can vote are already citizens 🤷🏿‍♂️. Why would they care about people who ""skipped the line""

6.. I could go on but this election effort from Dems just seems incompetent. 

I was poised to see trump lose popular but he shellacked her. This is a clear mandate. As a Kamala voter, I support Trump's win and hope he does well to help us all do better.

"It’s not even an “economic downturn” ffs. Low unemployment, record stock markets, inflation finally down. Pretty much every metric points to the economy being objectively good right now.

People have forgotten what a true economic downturn is, and I’m not talking about few months followed by a quick rebound with COVID. I’m talking a real recession with record unemployment, a return to inflation, a crashing stock market, and companies and jobs disappearing. That’s what we’re looking at if Trump and Elon get what they want, according to many economists.  He has no actual credible policies to solve the only bad economic metric: higher cost of living and a housing crisis.

Then we’ll elect a democrat (assuming we have another one of those elections) to clean up the mess left by the previous republican, as is tradition. Who will get voted out in 2032 in favor of the next moron that the republicans rally around.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

You imprison C suite execs and managers that hired them. You make the idea of employing someone without documentation business suicide. Without income or homes they'll by and large self deport. 

But does anyone ever suggest doing these actions? No. Because that would be a solution to a political wedge issue. Texas has been all red top down since the 90s. If they had wanted to fix the ""immigration"" problem they would have by now.

"Yes, that’s how inflation works. Inflation means that prices go up but never down. If they went down, we’d have *deflation*, which is usually a symptom of a severe economic downturn like a depression. The fact that people don’t understand this is a failure of our nation’s education system. Inflation increased following COVID, on a global scale and due in part to how fast the global economy rebounded and supply issues. They were able to bring it under control without causing an actual recession, which is remarkable.

And as for the housing, the housing crisis has existed longer than the last four years. 

The fed controls interest rates to manage both inflation and the strength of the economy. They *had* to raise rates or else inflation would get worse. If anything, they were slow to raise them and then slow again to cut them. Worthy criticism, but again, nothing to do with Biden or Kamala Harris.

It really is frustrating and frightening how people don’t understand any of these basic economic concepts. They just see rents and groceries go up, and blame the president in power as if they’ve got a “price goes down” button.

 It’s a powerful rhetorical technique but democracy is not going to end.  That’s not how it works.  Iran has democracy.  Israel has democracy.  It’s not a binary thing.  What happens is institutions slowly degrade, that’s what democracy ending looks like.   Not a violent revolution, it’s Jeff Bezos cancelling the editorial because he’s worried about federal contracts.  It’s Nixon being pardoned.  It’s death by a thousand papercuts.

Both sides haven’t been democratic. Really not a fan of the way the Democratic Party selected Harris for the people and obviously we know the issues with the the way Trump has acted,2024_11_07,00_28_37
"That’s the problem, or some see her as the threat because “communism/socialism” blah blah. 

If the economy was important, people who read would know she was a better candidate. We don’t have to assume how it’s going to be under him, we had 4 years of experience already with that.

In terms of health, women’s rights, education, gay rights, we know how it was under him.

In terms of world politics, republicans lately have been talking about Ukraine a lot, well we know what he tried to do to them, and his relationship with Putin.

When it comes to Gaza, we know what he thinks.

All of these are points where fair weather dems clutched their Starbucks cups and decided, well I’m not so sure about Harris and either didn’t vote, voted for someone else, or voted for Trump and that’s why he’s about to win. 

People can say that it’s that the dems didn’t put up the best candidate. But the fact is the media has been anti democratic for many years now. Biden faced lots of questions about his mental capabilities. Trump zero. Harris has been questioned about her policies. Trump zero. It wasn’t a fair fight, and especially not with twitter, and other social media outlets and AI shenanigans. 

She was popular. I haven’t seen enthusiasm like this since Obama. But trump win a lot of black and Latino male votes, and white women I’m pretty sure (data will tell later) still voted republican because “the economy” and other nonsense like that. 

Republicans are a party of reactionists who only care when something happens to their immediate tribe. Where democrats are a party of progressives trying to fix a problem for people before it becomes one.

Unfortunately we will see more stories like what happened in many states with women dying because of pregnancy related issues or denied abortions. We will see immigrants who voted for trump deported. We will see Medicaid and social security cut. And these people will be shocked because they thought it wasn’t going to affect them, it was going to affect the Other.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"The voters chose Biden. Biden would have won if his VP was almost anyone else. VPs historically mean very little in presidential elections.

So your argument falls flat. Sure, people settled on the idea that in some rare event, Harris might have been president under his term. But when they weighed Trump vs. Biden, and they liked Biden, it didn't matter who his VP was. But to make her the candidate is an entirely different game. It's dishonest to say it's a stupid argument to not like how they chose their candidate because she was already VP. It's entirely dishonest.

Biden is simply not mentally there. I do believe that it has been obvious for a while that he wasn’t mentally fit and he never should have been running for a second term to begin with. That’s the problem I have with it. The people could have picked between Harris, Newsom, Buttigieg, Moore, Whitmer, Shapiro, etc. Instead Kamala was picked for the people when she had the lowest approval rating of a vice president in American history.

When the incumbent pulls out of the race their vice president is not automatically given the primary. That’s what this discussion has been about.

Kamala did not win the primary election.,2024_11_07,00_28_37

The problem is the people did not vote for Joe with Kamala as his replacement. Even when removing Joe. It was not guaranteed that it would be Harris. That is a lie or you are miseducated. That’s not how the primary works. If Joe had to step down while in office it would work like that, but not during a primary.

If you can't empathize with this position, then you're being intentionally daft for the sake of partisanship or undeserved loyalty.

". Hopefully they stop relying on abortion to flip white women to the party

Dumb ass Democrats clung on to abortion like idiots when the writing on the wall was clear it's the economy stupid. 

Furthermore states like FLA an MO have demonstrated they can vote for trump while supporting abortion through state level referendums. 

For example FLAs got to 58npercent of a needed 60 to overturn the abortion ban there. And Missouri literally succeeded. 

Like trump said, abortion is not the firebrand issue the Dems though

And the vote shows that white women can vote based on their pocketbokk and still support abortion bans..further trump said NO National Ban and return the issue to states to decide. As he predicted and I mention some were more liberal than we assumed 


Then as a black man I think how in our circles we talk about reparations. The say No reparations the best I can do for you is abortion.  Abortion just isn't the big issue


2. The disregard for the Palestine issue. No explanation needed

3. No plan for migrants. Spends years calling trump racist and ignore calls tomshut down border only to have Biden do it in the last half of 24. Signalling republicans were right all along. 

4.  Then I think of young men. When I went to college in 2013, all that rape culture, toxic masculinity white privilege stuff was just coming out and we found it a little weird then too. Ten years later, kids who grew up with it from their toddler years to now are over it . Manospnere people and Rogan not feeling it. Young men went trump 

5. Latinos didn't care about trump attacks on migrants. The ones who can vote are already citizens 🤷🏿‍♂️. Why would they care about people who ""skipped the line""

6.. I could go on but this election effort from Dems just seems incompetent. 

I was poised to see trump lose popular but he shellacked her. This is a clear mandate. As a Kamala voter, I support Trump's win and hope he does well to help us all do better.

"Well, it's not much of an excuse, but the ""marriage is defined as one man and one woman"" language was only added to the CO constitution in 2006, when the state was more conservative and with a heavier religious slant.  When SCOTUS made gay marriage constitutionally protected at the federal level, the state definition essentially became null.

With faith in federal protections getting....shaky, removing that definition looked more necessary.  Though personally I'd have preferred a more pro-active *update* of the language (along the lines of ""two people of allowable age"") rather than deletion.  There's still state legislation using the old wording which also needs tweaking.  But that's more a job for the legislature.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Right, but that case wasn't even about the cake itself or a message on it. They never even got to the design. They were refused service purely because they were gay, and that should not be acceptable. That's why it's not a 'compelled speech' argument. There was no statement, design, wording etc in which to refuse, they could have asked for a plain white cake. So it wasn't about compelled speech, it was about who they are.

""the act of making the cake was part of the expected conduct of Phillips's business, and not an expression of free speech nor free exercise of religion.""

 I personally don't feel that religion gives you the right to discriminate on the bases of orientation, among other things. Now, if there is offensive message or such, then that is not the same. It's a cake, what harm does it cause you? If they wanted you to draw a dildo, fine, refuse it. That would hold up in court as well. But that is what you're in business for, cake making. A business open to the public should be open to ALL members of the public and not be able to pick and chose it's clientele on the basis of something that's a protected class. Which sexual orientation is in Colorado.

> Instead, they get litigious and try and ruin someone else's life for their choices while demanding others blindly and endlessly support their own life choices.

That's the fallacy, your religion governs YOU. Your religion does not get to govern ME. And that's what you're trying to do, force your religion on others by deny service under it's direction. It's funny when people think that someone just wanting to live their life and order a cake to celebrate a moment every other hetero couple does is somehow 'endlessly supporting their life choices' or 'shoving it in faces'. They're just living their life. In reality, by refusing service you are affecting others ability to live a free life by enforcing YOUR religious covenants on others.

While you have freedom of religion, to practice it. Others have freedom FROM religion. Your practice should not violate the rights of others to live freely.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Actually, it is. There is no human right to marriage. It doesn't exist in the U.S. Bill of Rights, nor does it exist anywhere else in the world. Marriage is a privilege that requires a license. Marriage is now - and always has been - an institution that exists only between one man and one woman. Very few exceptions have occurred throughout history, and they are broadly considered to be scandalous and are almost always illegal. Any attempts at marriage between anything other than a human male and a human female would have been illegal in every state until recent history.

There is no such thing as the effort to ""legalize"" homosexual marriage. That is a myth. There is, however, a movement that seeks to redefine the word ""marriage."" Homosexual marriage does not and can not exist unless the word is redefined. Homosexual marriage is precisely as real as a round cube.

"Dude, if you use the 8.7 millions species then sexual reproduction is not normal since there are more unicellular species that duplicate themselves via binary fission. 

It doesn't change the fact that there is nothing wrong with being gay and that it's totally normal among sexual reproducing species.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"My guy googled ""how many species of animal on earth"" and ""how many gay animals on earth"" and then took the bloody Google AI result.

I know because I just did that to see.

No, there's not 8.7 million species - unless you really want to consider hermaphroditism normal given that that figure includes plants. But you'd know that had you read down a tiny bit and seen that very same AI claim that there's only *1.2 million*.

Wikipedia (very reliable, I know) claims the current estimate is *at maximum* 7.77 million, with just over 1.5 million currently known.

And for the gay animals: The statistic comes from [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41290-x#Sec2) article in Nature, which itself says that ~5-6% (of individuals, not species) of hominidae (Our genetic family, the great apes) expressed same-sex relations. 50% of the families of those species exhibited same-sex relations at some point (with mammals notably higher than insects), and most of all: 

> [...] of the 22 mammalian species that are the subject of continuing long-term, individual-based field studies, same-sex sexual behaviour has been found in more than 80%.

That's right. Monkeys be gayin', and we be monkeys.

The study then goes on to point out that due to restrictions and limited timescales (Science words for ""We can't watch every monkey 24/7 in their natural habitats), as well as only recently being an area of research, it says that incidence is likely to be heavily underreported.

And all this is ignoring how few species in total were actually surveyed, obviously. So they're treating unstudied animals as 'not gay'. So we have the extremely small sample size of a single study into animal homosexual acts against literally every species, animal or not, believed to exist on earth counting as 'straight'.

**TL;DR:** This person spent 30s on google and I had to spend 30m reading a research paper because they were not just wrong, not only did they not even get the data they were using correct, but they read it so little that they included plants and microbes under 'not gay'.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

It prevents what happened in AZ with abortion, where once Roe was overturned a total abortion ban resumed affect in AZ and they had to change law.

States have left dead language in constitutions believing it to be irrelevant to need to go back to adjust every text. Just as some states still have Blasphemy laws, were speaking against god is punishable offense -- which is now unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

Several still have it in their constitution, requiring public officials to pass religious tests, meaning they have to belong to a specific religion to serve. That's currently overruled by a 1961 SC decision rendering them unconstitutional. If that similarly was overturned, it would immediately go into affect in close to 10 states.

That's why some housekeeping should be required and expected of a state to ensure their written laws and constitution reflect the current state and the desires of it's people. Regardless of constitutionality, old text shouldn't remain.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

Also, even if you want to downplay slavery, the US still did everything else I said. And also, when the phrase was first said women couldn't even vote.

"Hopefully they stop relying on abortion to flip white women to the party

Dumb ass Democrats clung on to abortion like idiots when the writing on the wall was clear it's the economy stupid. 

Furthermore states like FLA an MO have demonstrated they can vote for trump while supporting abortion through state level referendums. 

For example FLAs got to 58npercent of a needed 60 to overturn the abortion ban there. And Missouri literally succeeded. 

Like trump said, abortion is not the firebrand issue the Dems thought

And the vote shows that white women can vote based on their pocketbokk and still support abortion access....further trump said NO National Ban and return the issue to states to decide. As he predicted and I mention some were more liberal than we assumed 


Then as a black man I think how in our circles we talk about reparations. The say No reparations the best I can do for you is abortion.  Abortion just isn't the big issue


2. The disregard for the Palestine issue. No explanation needed

3. No plan for migrants. Spends years calling trump racist and ignore calls tomshut down border only to have Biden do it in the last half of 24. Signalling republicans were right all along. 

4.  Then I think of young men. When I went to college in 2013, all that rape culture, toxic masculinity white privilege stuff was just coming out and we found it a little weird then too. Ten years later, kids who grew up with it from their toddler years to now are over it . Manospnere people and Rogan not feeling it. Young men went trump 

Remember Bernie Bros 😂 😂 😂 

5. Latinos didn't care about trump attacks on migrants. The ones who can vote are already citizens 🤷🏿‍♂️. Why would they care about people who ""skipped the line""

6.. I could go on but this election effort from Dems just seems incompetent. 

I was poised to see trump lose popular but he shellacked her. This is a clear mandate. As a Kamala voter, I support Trump's win and hope he does well to help us all do better.

A federal ban supersedes state laws, and federal law enforcement will still enforce.  It is most definitely not harder.  Especially since people just gave Republicans control of the House and the Senate.  A federal ban will be incredibly easy to do under a Trump presidency.

I think the way we're handling immigration is being done poorly, but I don't think Trump's methods would be any better.

I'd like to see our asylum process streamlined; no more accepting ANY until our backlog is done. Then accept a limited amount on a year basis; no more than we can handle. Everyone else is deported.

Arguably Biden has done some great stuff on pocketbook issues for the working class but like I stated, they don't communicate their wins well, big or small. Why isn't Biden out there bragging on his administration doing really great antitrust work, by the likes of Lina Khan, Jonathan Kantor, and Rohit Chopra? Why didn't Kamala talk them up and how she needs to win for them to finish their work to end price gouging by monopolists? Or the FBI raids on exploitative landlords and lawsuits against Realpage to address the cost of living?

The Dem's solutions are too incremental, technical, and means-tested.  Their messaging is too nuanced, vapid, and/or couched in plausible deniability. Ever notice how ""telling it like it is"" or being a ""straight shooter"" is ALWAYS seen as a good quality in politicians? I assume because Dems see themselves as the Big Tent party they have to be inoffensive to everyone but by doing so, they appear vapid and alienate the working poor that struggle daily and are getting angrier and angrier at the system, our institutions, and apparently our social norms. Along the way, ironically in the fight for social justice, Democrats did end up alienating insecure white guys unintentionally and they do need to fix that. 

Trump or his advisers gets this and uses it to his advantage. 

I would love to have seen Kamala speaking to more everyday people's concerns.  Not telling them how bad Trump and Project 2025 will be, or how the stock market is doing great even though that only matters to the top 50%, arguably top 10%, or that inflation is down when people experience price increases viscerally everyday. Her polling was never higher than we she was talking a populist game and picked populist Tim Walz as a running mate. She should've differentiated herself from Biden better OR embraced his antitrust work as part of her price-gouging and cost-of-living focus.

This is the long term result of the Clinton realignment to cozy-up with corporations and mega-donors while leaving labor in the dust so I'm not solely blaming Harris. Shit even as a pro-union guy, I think the unions themselves have a lot of blame on their hands as well for poor messaging while they greased their palms.

"This is because Hispanic is a label white people use to describe an entire continent of peoples, who are different from each other and are perfectly capable of disliking each other.

Most Hispanic US citizens' ancestors came from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, or the Dominican Republic. They either came in on legal immigrant visas or, in Puerto Rico's case, were always US citizens. Furthermore, the Hispanic peoples in the US are now deeply rooted and have been in the US multiple generations. Many who are US-born don't even speak Spanish. 

They simply don't see themselves as connected to refugees and illegal immigrants, who now mostly come from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Just because these countries are also majority Spanish-speaking doesn't make them the same. They are of different ethnicities. Remember that many refugees are Indigenous people who don't even always speak Spanish.

So some US citizen Hispanics react to them the same way white British people did to white Eastern European immigrants a decade ago - with revulsion, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to keep them out. They are US citizens and don't think deportation will happen to them - and tbf, it probably won't.

The fact that opposition to immigration nationwide is driven largely by white hostility to more Hispanic and Asian faces in the country doesn't matter. There are plenty of Hispanic men who are willing to identify as white for this reason - just as many immigrants in the UK and their descendants voted for Brexit. You don't have to be white to be racist. And you certainly don't have to be white to be sexist, transphobic, or authoritarian.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"A lot of these men don't even consider themselves ""Hispanic men"". That's one of the big problems right there. They don't see themselves as ""Hispanic men"". They're just American men who happen to be Hispanic. They being Hispanic isn't something that defines them and their politics and Democrats and the pundit class has to recognize that. Especially the ones in Texas who've been here for decades/forever.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Let's be real when it says Hispanic it means Mexicans and Cubans, Puerto Ricans and Central Americans are more left leaning, dont lump us with those two especially Cubans who are way more right leaning than even Mexicans. Its a complicated make up than just blaming all Hispanics where the increases were less in swing states and more in Red states which were already red anyways. Hispanics is more than just those 2 who lean heavily conservative and hate other Hispanics more than Central and Southern Americans do other Hispanics. From what I saw Puerto Ricans make the biggest Latino vote in PA and voted 77 to 23 in favor of Harris so they did their part in PA.

The truth is that it was just 2016 all over again where Dems didn't come out to vote, hell even Trump had lees votes than last time. People underestimate how much minorities don't like women leaders. You can't believe how many black, Hispanic, asian people Ive spoke to in a democratic city I live in couldn't stand Kamala even black women here preferred a man running the show because the bible or whatever and thats why they liked Obama/Biden. I heard the same BS during Hilarys run from Hispanic/Black women let alone the men. Minorities by far dislike women in leadership which is ridiculous but a sad fact. Biden cooked us going for a 2nd term and backing out last minute and not letting people choose between Kamala and someone else and at least would have given more time for her to campaign and maybe won some votes with enough time.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Kind of silly to assume that minorities, particularly Latino men, are immune from racism or misogyny. Nothing about their minority status makes them more wise or immune from claims they can be better than someone else. Crapping on their women is a typical trait of insecure males of all races and ethnicities. And Latino men in particular are known for their toxic masculinity, hardcore Catholicism/Pentecostalism, and love of strongmen. Not all Latino men, of course, but a common thread among the uneducated. Sorry, snowflakes, these are the facts. 

I for one am going to be looking to cut back on my nonessentials in anticipation of the usual GOP-induced economic recession. Where I live, Hispanic men comprise the vast majority of folks in the home construction and landscaping trades, and Hispanic women in the cleaning trades. These are the first things people cut back on when times get tough. Maybe the demand crater will be balanced out by Trump deporting so many of the workers. Who knows.

The (edit: Trump*) deportation scheme is too costly, too long, and too economically devastating to be implemented fully. Unless you deploy the military, there's not enough ICE agents to process all the deportees.

Doesn't mean that Stephen Miller will not try. Expect ICE vans to stalk the morning migrant crowds looking for work outside Home Depot. We will get some high profile episodes where an armed immigrant stands off against SWAT in suburban cul de sacs. There will be a massive chilling effect, where illegals will just vanish from society. They would rather hunker down than self deport, hoping the next president will save them. The negative effect on the labour market will be noticeable. 

Fresh produce is gonna get more expensive, sigh 

The scheme will mostly fail in deporting millions of people, since we saw what happened with [Alabama's 2011 anti immigration stunt](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna53847137). Protesters and resistance by bureaucracy will slow that effort down, if it gets real bad. But maybe around 100,000 people will be cruelly abused and deported, with no legal recourse. That means some legal residents and citizens will get unfairly arrested, and put on buses. A non zero number of arrested US citizens will have voted for Trump, or have relatives who have. **Can't wait for the LAMF stories then**; ACLU will not save any US citizens, if Miller destroys all citizenship records immediately upon deportation.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

At least he displays all those characteristics but people were/are more willing to disregard them for him as opposed to be unwilling to disregard them for her. That is the interesting part. We can clearly look up flat out blatant lies he’s made and been caught on but people will choose to ignore them. He threatens anyone and everyone depending on the way the wind blows but people will ignore it and look past it, still loving him and the qualifications part is debatable - on one hand he has run successful businesses, though they have been plagued with corruption and he’s also had many failed ones as well, but still he has done it. But his ability to pick people for staffing has been horrible at the government level, the turnover under his first administration was unprecedented. Not only his hired staff but you had military generals saying they couldn’t work for him. I guess I’m wondering why, compared to what has been a fully documented history, Harris has been found to be less likeable, trustworthy and qualified? And I mean this as an actual question.

It's exaggerated McCarthyism.

I wouldn't be surprised if, after analyzing the demographics of the ‘Latino’ vote, the breakdown of the ‘Latino’ Trump vote would come out as follows:

- Middle-class second and third generation Mexican Americans and Colombian Americans

- Third generation Central American descendants

- Cuban Americans

- Venezuelan Americans

"*From Bloomberg News reporter* [*Steven T. Dennis*](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ASnsiUdv5go/steven-t-dennis)

Two Black women, Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blunt Rochester, have won US Senate seats representing Maryland and Delaware, breaking another barrier in a 235-year-old institution long dominated by White men.

Only 11 Black people have served in the Senate, and only three of them have been women. Never before have two Black women been seated at the same time.

The two Democrats will be sworn into office steps away from the desk that belonged to Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy.

I don’t think I can be anymore clear. I sobbed in the bathroom because he won. Taking a break from the news doesn’t end that knowledge or my fear of what a Republican run government under his rule is going to bring.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
A primary would have been a good idea,2024_11_07,00_28_37
Hindsight yeah. But it could have easily been weaponized against them as well.  It would have been used as another avenue to create divisions in the party like Gaza did.,2024_11_07,00_28_37

">“If just 1% more of President Trump’s supporters responded to texts like this in 2020, we wouldn’t be in the mess we’re in today,” read the campaign text, sent out this afternoon. “The fact is, Democrats have the money, the media, and the full weight of the DC establishment behind them. And at this moment, the Democrat Machine is out in full force for Kamala. She will have gained millions of votes by the time you’re done reading this message. If we’re going to keep up, we need you to show up and vote.”

>“Please don’t be the reason we wake up tomorrow with President-Elect Kamala Harris,” the text added. “Doing nothing is not an option.”

I can't confirm that as an insider but from what the insiders journalists claim to've spoken to have said, that's the situation. 

Another factor is that Trump throws fits over bad news and is prone to ""shooting the messenger"", so even the relatively more competent people don't want to produce accurate results that result in a risk of being punished for delivering reality to someone who only wants good news.

I would imagine there is a sort of situation where some people simply go around Trump entirely to report to more level headed campaign leadership to deal with that to an extent, but the overall organization of his campaign is reported to be quite dysfunctional.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"[This is specifically why Biden has spent the last year and a half fortifying NATO in case of a Trump win.](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241027-europe-guardrails-tries-to-trump-proof-security-nato)

> To off-set this possibility, steps have been taken on both sides of the Atlantic to ""Trump-proof"" support for Ukraine, providing it with enough financial and military assistance so it can continue to resist Russian encroachment in the long term. 

> NATO this summer announced it was establishing a special mission, known as the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), which would be headquartered in Germany. Its creation essentially means that from now on it will be NATO itself, rather than its biggest contributor the United States, that will coordinate training Ukrainian troops and providing military equipment. 

> The Group of 7 – which unites the United States, Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Canada and Japan – finalised a $50 billion long-term loan to Ukraine that would be funded largely by the interest on frozen Russian assets in Europe.  

> Outgoing US President Joe Biden has backed up his European allies by pre-empting the potential risk of a US withdrawal from the deal should Trump be re-elected by making sure the $20 billion US contribution will start becoming available by the end of the year. Congress has approved five bills on Ukraine assistance since the start of the war worth $175 billion, with $106 billion going directly to the government of Ukraine. At a news conference in Riga in mid-October, James O’Brien, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, said that Biden will be “emptying out” the funds the US Congress has earmarked for Ukraine before the end of his term. 


> Although it is not possible for a US president to unilaterally pull the country out of NATO – Congress last year passed a law that such a decision needs Senate approval – Trump’s threat still remains very real as he calls the Alliance's golden rule on mutual defence into question.

TL;DR NATO and the Biden Administration have been formulating a contingency plan that empties out current US funding for Ukraine, while transitioning responsibilities to European powers, who are funding it with frozen Russian assets.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

If Ukraine had, in early 2022,  the weapons they have now, the Russians would have been utterly defeated. Right now, it's too late. Not only is Ukraine going to lose what the Russians occupy at this point, but it will also have no means to lift itself up from the destruction. Any national assets of value, either already are, or will soon be taken over by multinational corporations to pay for the war.

Only this time, the end of it doesn't result in a world war, it results in humanity becoming extinct in the climate apocalypse as climate denialism becomes the law of the land in America and every other fascist dictatorship. If France falls to National Front and Germany falls to AfD (which is now extremely likely since Putin and Trump will be working together on that with the resources of the United States government at their full control) then that's the ballgame. China becomes the only major country doing anything about the climate crisis and it simply won't be enough. The climate will continue to deteriorate until full scale ecological collapse and every human on Earth starves to death sometime in the 2100s.

"Two things worry me greatly in this result. And neither is cheating. I’m willing to believe there was suppression and cheating if it comes up credibly, but not sure it goes anywhere near explaining the gap. I said for months now the Dems needed results just like this to put mandate behind fighting a steal. And the other side got that. 

The two things:

1. Misinformation is so much worse than we’ve even imagined.  This feels like a piece that will come out more and more going forward. And nothing substantial enough was done on it for a decade now. 

2. We let the billionaires buy up the media. And it was turned on us. It’s not theory anymore to me. It’s what they did as an institution. They didn’t do it in such brash ways as misinformation bots, but they shot the blue cause in the foot often.

Now (while I don’t believe it, I voted for her) she came out of the shadows to try and get the title of president. It’s the perception it’s given to many, including many in my family and circles in Florida and New Jersey.

"I honestly wish I could see this election from the lens of one of the so-called undecided voters. I spent a bit of time listening to interviews with these people, trying to understand what is driving their indecision. And so many times they would say they needed to know more about her policies, or they “didn’t know what she stands for,” and it infuriated me. 

I asked myself if these people were just lazy, and needed every single bit of information spoon-fed to them and couldn’t take a few minutes to simply go on her damn campaign website and look up what it is she was proposing. Or listen to what she was saying during the debate where she very clearly outlined policy proposals. 

I’m not surprised by this, honestly. I’m very disappointed to say the least, but feel like I’ve had time to process this and accept the outcome even if I don’t like it. But the fact is that the world has been dealing with an anti-incumbent sentiment for a while now, and the US was no exception. The tragedy is that while yes, it is the economy, it proves that people are not switched on enough to understand everything they’ve just gambled for some short-term hope of economic gain. 

It’s almost certain people will suffer, many who voted for him included. But whether they stayed home, or voted Trump, the people have spoken. We can’t even claim electoral college shenanigans this time around. He won the popular vote! Elections matter and people are gonna find out for real this time around.

"I'm actually confused by that. 

In my opinion she is way more likeable and relatable. 
Didn't act entitled. 
Had some fairly decent policies.
Didn't say or do anything singularly destructive to the movement. 

I'm just not sure I understand our countries values anymore. I liked her way more than Biden or Clinton. And everyone I spoke to seemed way more enthusiastic about her as well. 

Yet somehow, the cruel person who called the other side varmen, is a convicted felon, twice impeached, regularly says intentionally hurtful things, is more popular...

Truly an odd paradigm shift in American politics. 
And he shows no intention on fighting for any values I have... So IDK how I fit in his America. He doesn't make me feel like he will be a president for anyone other than his rich friends and those he's convinced are just people that will be rich someday too.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

Stop pretending our country is virtuous dude. They rejected Hillary in 2016 because she was a woman. Now this time around they didn't go with the safe route (another generic white guy instead of Biden) and took on that hurdle. 

This country will never be ready for a female leader. Add the part that she's a POC and that's another roadblock. 

Then when you factor in the people who already disliked Biden over Covid, Gaza, Ukraine, etc. she basically took on his baggage. She was going to lose voters that way too.

2)as soon as they acknowledged it themselves, they slapped her as the presumptive candidate without any kind of primary… that was just strange and left a bad taste in many peoples’ mouths.


3)you were screamed at to step in line if you even questioned her being the new candidate


4)if she had all of these great policy ideas, the natural question was, “okay but like… why didn’t you get them implemented with Biden as your pres?” 
She should’ve completely shit on the negative parts of his presidency in order to distance herself more (I honestly think that would’ve helped tremendously)


5) You had the whole Middle East deal going on where young liberals are screaming that terrorist organizations are a-okay by them. Most moderates cannot stomach supporting HAMAS. 


6)as much as people don’t want to admit it, *most* Americans do not want a Trans-heavy agenda. Most people have accepted gay and lesbian now, but suddenly screaming about neo-pronouns and non-binary and whatever else also turns off most moderates.

And then lambasting voters for being bad people for voting for him. Ads about husbands not allowing their wives to vote, in 2024. Just insulting. 

They need to actually address issues that Americans care about. Their only major winner is abortion rights but the reps walked it back so much after it became clear that Roe v Wade was political suicide. I heard several ads that were like ""X claims they're fine with abortion now but they used to proudly claim they were pro-life"" about republicans. Since they all are flip-flopping. If dems lose abortion as their main political cudgel they will get absolutely reamed. 

The messaging is just a mess. Dems really need to figure out a better way to speak to the voting base, the nagging and scolding is not working. Even here, there's a bunch of comments that have the democratic feeling of ""scolding voters for being bad people."" This is not winning any votes, it never will.

Then WikiLeaks released DNC emails just before the convention, revealing communications that seemed to mock or dismiss Sanders’ campaign. These were about how DNC staffers were discussing ways to undermine Sanders.

What the Democrats should have been doing is angling for programs and plans that would actually help all the struggling people.  Universal Basic Income, taxing the uber rich, legalizing recreational drugs, student loan forgiveness, etc.

Instead they made no real progress on anything progressive(they really couldn't have because of a lack of voting power) and then made no policy declarations about what they would do for these situations.

Look at the 10Q for June 30 - here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001140361-24-036633.htm

See the column in balance sheet, current liabilities: ""unearned revenue""?  It's 2,924.6[0]

Now look in the 10Q for September.  Here:  https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001140361-24-045260.htm

And look at that unearned revenue figure now:  1,959.7[0]

It's down.  It's a liability. Good news, right?

Not so fast.  What is unearned revenue you ask?  It's money that was PAID in the past for services to be delivered sometime later.  When a dollar's worth of services are eventually rendered, then we add a dollar in the revenue line, and subtract a dollar in the unearned revenue line.  It's money the company gets to count as ""revenue"" in the future, even though customers won't be paying it in the future. 

What this means is that when unearned revenue goes down in a quarter, we can subtract that same amount from revenue in the quarter, to figure out how much customers actually paid the firm this quarter.

Revenue in Sept quarter was 1,010.9[0]

Reduction in unearned revenue was 2924.6-1952.7 = 971.9[0]

Which means my dudes that the full amount of money this firm collected from customers this quarter was not just over a cool million...  It was a mere $39K!!!    
 
And what did the company spend this quarter on sales and marketing to attract this $39K from customers?  $2,189.4[0]K

You can argue that Trump is a terrible human being and a terrible candidate, and I totally agree…but a lot of people vote for candidates they believe in, not necessarily against candidates they don’t believe in.

It didn’t happen, so now you aren’t going to be able to convince those people who showed up to vote last time.  You’ve failed to improve their lives after you promised them you would.  

The reason Kamala lost wasn’t that more people love Trump, it’s that she didn’t engage voters enough to get them to vote FOR her.  

At some point the Dems (specifically the DNC) have to realize that they need to put forth candidates people actually want versus what they are fed.  Obama dominated as a black man when people said it could never happen.  Why?  He was a good candidate that people wanted.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

> According to Google Trends, search results for &quot;Did Joe Biden drop out&quot; have peaked this week, and are spiking on Election Day, even though the president had dropped out of the 2024 race this summer and endorsed the current Democratic Party nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.

> While it&#039;s been months since Biden officially dropped out of the race, apparently there are still Americans who don&#039;t know who&#039;s running for president.

> &quot;Imagine being a voter who just today found out Joe Biden isn&#039;t running,&quot; Armand Domalewski, a data scientist and cofounder of YIMBYs for Harris, posted on X Tuesday.

"DOVER, Del. — U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester defeated Republican Eric Hansen in Delaware’s U.S. Senate race on Tuesday.

Blunt Rochester will become the first woman and first Black person to represent Delaware in the Senate. Only three other [Black women](https://apnews.com/article/election-senate-harris-black-women-maryland-54c411e0a0f4d3d84de95246b09be304) have served in the Senate, two of them elected and one who was appointed.

Rochester was considered a virtual shoo-in for the Senate against businessman Hansen, a political newcomer. Democrats hold a significant voter registration advantage over Republicans in solid-blue Delaware, which last sent a Republican to Washington in 2008.

Rochester raised some $8 million for her Senate campaign, while Hansen’s campaign receipts totaled only about $1 million, including more than $800,000 in loans he made to his campaign.

"I'm a gay and married disabled combat veteran. Because of my multiple deployments (and multiple injuries) in Iraq, I receive monthly VA disability compensation. As a married individual, I get about 15% more than I would if were single. There is good reason for this that includes the fact that my spouse must care for me at times. When Trump inevitably repeals same-sex marriage, this will directly harm me and my family. A big agenda under Project 2025 is to gut VA disability benefits. This means that the extra 15% will disappear because the federal government will no longer recognize my marriage. Not only that, but they very specifically want to cut/limit VA disability benefits for PTSD. For me, that's another 50%. 

So, the very benefits I earned through a decade of service will be cut by half or more, making simply living impossible for me. I will literally starve. I am barely scraping by as it is.

"What i see from Europe is that the Republican party has destroyed education and trust in the experts so much that not enough people have the critical thinking necessary to see....either that or they don't have the morality to care...........that Trump was, and is, and for the next decade most likely will be.....the fking worst decision from any and all viewpoints possible and impossible.

Not only was Kamalla quite a good candidate on a number of issues, from the economy, to abortion, to job creation and so much more...but is seems that in order for a black woman to be elected in America as president,she would need to be actual divinity or something like that because of how much hate, racism and misoginy there is.

In exchange Donald Trump did almost all there was to be done, except murder someone on camera, and he still won...

Everybody saw what happened on January 6th but it seems nobody cared, because there was no precedent made, no justice served on the spot, because all his friends just bailed him out and nobody cares about that either.

Nobody seems to care about his 34 fraud accounts on which he was found guilty, perhaps because many people know that guilt is irrelevant.

Nobody seems to care about all his rape allegations, because it seems many white people would like to also do that and get away with it.

Nobody seems to care about his hateful words and slurs, because they seem to revel in it, without the foresight of what that would logically follow.

Nobody seems to care...or even know...that Trump did nothing he promised he would in the first term, or that what he did, he did for the worsening of everyone's but the rich life conditions, but somehow still many people voted for him...for the economy? Also nobody knows what a tariff is? So people just trust what Trump says a tariff is? Because people are ignorant and uneducated?

Everybody of a color different than white or of a religion different than Christianity or of gender different that male or of a sexuality different than straight who voted for this guy....aren't aware he'd get rid of them much like Hitler did in Nazi Germany? Or they simply don't care as long as he punishes people they hate? Or simply it's the ""leopards eating people eating's faces"" joke all over again?

Not even after project 2025, the 2 impeachments, the idiots that support him, or the enormous number of people, both celebrities and Republicans AND HIS OWN CHOSEN STAFF that endorsed Kamalla?

Man...i begin to think that the only way...to put y'all out of your misery...would have been if someone actually managed to assassinate Trump, like.....it's a cult, it's just a cult. 

The only conceivable way i see it now...would be if Trump just dies of a heart attack or something because of his old age...78-82 he'd be.... then Vance just is so incapable he somehow destroyes everything.

Either that or Trump brings about the Next Great Depression and you guys actually start a revolution. 

Yes, that's just how bad it looks from out here, i may be wrong, after all...his first term was simply bad and many people exaggerated, maybe so do i now, but really, i think ...nah..i know...this will end very badly for a lot of people.

"The easiest way to think about it is that the tariffs will force manufacturers to bring jobs back on shore because the cost is going to be too high to import. People will vote with their wallets and if you have to choose between made in America with a 20% discount versus imported from China. So hopefully if things go to plan toilet paper would be manufactured inside the United States using domestic production instead of importing it from Mexico I'm using this as an example. Now corporations can and will pass on the cost to consumer who will pay more for less. What remains to be seen is if there will domestic alternatives will spring up to compete. 

If you can increase consumption by somehow also getting rid of income taxes. The problem is that we're not going to stop spending money. You shift the burden from tax income to consumption tax and since there are a lot more people who need to buy toilet paper, you spread the tax burden which would have normally been paid by wealthy top or 1 percenters to a more broader electorate because everybody needs to buy toilet paper. But when a billionaire buys toilet paper doesn't really affect him or her. But if you spend half of your monthly income on toilet paper, probably going to affect you a lot more. It's a long-term play to shift the center of revenue generation from the income taxes and business taxes to consumption and VAT like taxes whether it makes things better or not, that's TBD. It's actually a lot more like how Europe is. Only in this country it'll be used to fund the military.

The problem is that it's way easier to import toilet paper then it is to manufacturing it today, the idea that the EPA is blocking the toilet paper factories and environmental reviews need to go away. But this also relies on corporations being brought to heel megacorps don't need America as much as they used too and I'm not sure if Trump can even do that.


The real problem will become if a country like China sees the economic disruption. Trump is going to create as rising to the level that making a move on Taiwan makes sense and then we are stuck in a situation where Trump who is more or less anti-war will be forced to make decisions about what to do with Taiwan That's probably the most realistic crisis that could easily happen. Nato has essentially militarily defeated Russia and Ukraine to the point of a stalemate and Russia needs to make a deal, which Trump will happily make. The Iranians will also come to the table because that's the only way to reel in the Israelis who will be emboldened, but with China it is completely open-ended in terms of what could happen.

Whether he's actually in charge of *anything* is almost abstract to them, because they don't think of anyone being ""in charge"" of them beyond their immediate circle (employer, parent, teacher if they have one, parole officer, etc)

The majority of voters don't care about much, but the things they do care about are owned by a select few Oligarchs, and those Oligarchs (which is what they are, Billionaires here are basically just the whitewashed name we use for Oligarchs in America) knew that Trump in the White House is best for their business. And being as they own all the spaces, the outlets, in which his shortcomings could be understood and metabolized, they've basically made sure to transform those things into... nothing.

The truth of his failings, his shortcomings, his ugliness - don't matter. Not in education-light, regulation-free, repercussion-zero spaces owned by billionaires that we all think we need to live in. The only thing that matters is whether they can be used to rub your nose in shit later, and that's easy enough to do, and that feels great in the spaces they own. The only thing that matters is feeling good in these spaces, living transitory moment-to-moment, feeling spitefully wonderful, knowing someone who ""thinks they're better than you"" isn't better than you, because the Oligarchs had the better brand, and you bought it, and you won.

Democracy's last breath was a belch in favor of Oligarchy. It doesn't matter what figurehead is in charge - clearly, this figurehead almost got shot and the people who just gave him the popular vote stopped caring that he got shot at in less than a week.

And the irony in all of this is that if Garland had acted immediately, in 2021, to appoint a SC and bring Trump to trial - there would have been a full public trial and the voters would have seen what a disaster Trump was on J6.  Even discounting the fact that he lead the attempted coup, less attention has been given to the fact that he twiddled his thumbs while the Capitol was sacked.  Too bad we will never get a trial now.

The only people who will eventually see a courtroom over J6 are Jack Smith and Merrick Garland - for whatever bogus reason Trump's DOJ dreams up to hold a show trial.  My guess is that they don't get 2-3 years of stays for interlocutory appeals to SCOTUS either.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

I was very confused by this patient's attitude because doesn't this paternalism (folks can't be trusted with the truth that someone else needs to hold it for them) betray that ""rugged"" individualist preference for autonomy (people have a right to access their own lab results and can choose to have someone explain it to them)?

"\> By the time Russia gets re equipped 

The Russian economy will never recover from where it is today. There is no ""re-equiped"" they are past the point of no return with their inflation issues. 

Israel stayed out of the Ukraine conflict initially but I dont think it is going to be inclined to do so going forward. The fact that they turned a blind eye to the ""Wagner Group"" being so active in the region (actual Russian nazi's) was shocking but I suspect they saw the way the wind was blowing. Russian gold to Iran for arms. That gold then funds hezbola, Hamas, and Yemen. 

Dont forget Yemen... The Saudi's (also Trump Friends) are almost ready to side with Israel against Iran because Russian missile tech is just a bit more than any one in the area wants them to have. Too bad Trump fucked the Iran Nuke deal where this would have been a non issue for the region...Ooops. 

Note: I do feel bad for Gaza but Egypt has been fighting on their side of the border (Siani) killing ""isis"" for the last 10 years and no one gave a shit about the death toll then. 

Does Trump want deals in Israel (who has money) or does he want deals with Russians (who no longer have money). Between Bibi and the military industrial complex seeing the conflict ringing the cash register I dont think trump is going to ""stop"" anything. 

\> The EU military group isn't as strong without the US

The French are rather pissed. First, Wagner pushed them out of their holdings in Africa (it's complicated). Second the French have already hinted that they would send ""trainers"" to Ukraine. The Russians response was NOT to say ""nukes"" rather to say ""they would be legitimate targets"" because the France is the only nuclear power who openly has a first strike doctrine. 

IF by some small miracle trump did pull off some sort of Russia deal, it's going to make tariffs directed at China ""tough"". Furthermore No one in the musk/thiel/Ventrue capital set is going to let him kill the cips act or back down Taiwan. The Xi Putin friction at that point is an ""incident"" waiting to happen...

With 15m+ of Americans not voting im not surprised of this flip,2024_11_07,00_28_37
"It's actually wild. If you look at how demographics voted, he LOST supporters with white people and gained substantially with every other demo minus black women. 100% did not see that coming.

It really makes me wonder how policy will change because of it. If minorities are now a major backer of trump what does the next 4 years look like? Does he change his rhetoric a little bit or do they keep going the direction it seems and he loses all support in 4 years.

  
I dont like saying it but as a middle age straight white dude that voted Harris I don't think the Ds can run anyone but a youngish normal straight white guy for the next 20+ years. It's not what I think is right but just looking at how this went and how the 2016 election went I think it's fair to say we are not ready for a woman. It's time to play it safe even if that means somethings taking a back seat for awhile. Shut up about any policies that don't mention the economy and housing. That's what people care about. It's sad to say we cant run on purely ""this is the right thing to do policies"". People care about being able to afford to live and everything else falls way behind.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

I am a gun owner and I pretty much agree with centrist views when it comes to the economy and government spending etc but I’m gay and well the social aspect of the left just makes sense…It was sad to hear how much they love trump especially me being a gay man as well.

People didn't care for her and didnt come out simple as that. 

It may have been different if they had allowed actual primary voting and we could have seen how well received she was. Biden cooked us running for a 2nd term given his age and haphazardly giving Kamala the reigns. Also PR people did their part. Voted 77 to 23 for Kamala in PA. And all Latinos 72 to 28.

"> Donald Trump's 2024 election victory over Kamala Harris saw significant shifts among Latino and Black voters, traditionally Democratic demographics. Trump gained 13% of Black voters and 45% of Latino voters, up from his 2020 support levels, especially among Black and Latino men in swing states like Pennsylvania and cities such as Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and Detroit. Economic concerns, particularly inflation, and dissatisfaction with recent economic conditions resonated with these groups. Additionally, Trump made notable gains in areas like South Texas, historically Democratic, flipping Starr County. Analysts attribute these shifts to Trump’s focus on working-class concerns and a lack of consistent Democratic engagement with Latino voters outside election cycles.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

They always try to take it too far, while most Americans lie more in line with the middle. The people care about the economy, which Dems glazed over and Trump beat to death. It’s a fun story and all, making changes that benefit all Americans, but the truth is that most Americans only care about themselves, and when they vote for a candidate, they ask themselves what that candidate will do for them specifically, not everyone else. While Harris should have only focused on economic policy, her campaign did nothing but paint Trump as a fascist and racist. So I ask, what does that messaging do that benefits a single voter?

There are conservative Latinos (ex: Miami Cubans) and there are left wing Latinos (ex: Cesar Chavez). The plantation owner in Brazil is a Latino, as are the impoverished workers on it. 

Just because they are Latino doesn’t mean they automatically have a racial solidarity with illegal immigrants who are also Latino. Most legal immigrants do not like illegal immigrants in general.

They might not get everyone, but they are going to destroy as many lives as they can. They have unchecked power now. Whatever you thought or hoped the US was going to be, it's not going to be that now. 

I suspect a lot of these deportations are going to take a long time to pull off. But they are going to round up immigrants, put them in detention centers, and then say they have to ""pay their own way"" while in holding for an indefinite amount of time. Boom, slavery. They realize they can't remove all of the illegal immigrants and still have a functional agriculture system. They feel like this country was built on the backs of slaves, and they want to go back to that. This election proved that a majority of people are pretty OK with being racists, so a majority of people won't care that this is happening. Trump is learning from China's use of the [Uyghurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghurs) as slave labor in reeducation camps. He will definitely try to do this in the US.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"They not only had the policies, people will straight up blurt out ""Sure but what did she run on?!"".

Policies not only do not win elections, they straight up do not matter to anyone who isn't already voting D. They will not look, they will not listen, they will not participate because they do not give one fuck about policy, they only want fig leaf excuses to not do anything and remaining ignorant of very easily located information that is actively pushed out to them is a way to do that. We live in the most information accessible time of the entirety of human history, and they just won't do it, and will use not putting in the basic effort to self justify their own inaction because they weren't personally spoon fed with a one on one meeting.

To simplify; Our nation is locked into terminal stupidity. One side is reactionary as their default means of understanding and interacting with reality, both that side and the inactive folks are committed to proudly maintaining ignorance and posturing, and the remainder is deluded into thinking they can fix any of these two prior groups.

"> And what do legal (voting) Latinos have to fear about mass deportations? They still sided with Biden even after Trump didn’t mass-deport them. I mean where has Trump even advocated for stripping Latinos of citizenship?

Legal latinos have everything to fear from mass deportations. There are plenty of examples of latino men being deported over the last two decades and being unable to re-enter the country and prove their citizenship and being stuck in legal limbo in Mexico or wherever. When the mass deportations start, they aren't going to take their time, they're not going to listen to the people they're deporting, they're just going to do it. 

If Latino men think they're part of the in-group with the white men that favor this policy, they're in for an incredibly rude awakening. Legal Latino men have no use to white nationalist men, they're in the way of what the white men want.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

Deaton alleged that Warren have Gensler the questions ahead of time for his senate hearings.,2024_11_07,00_28_37

"Voting for Trump and for forced-birth fanaticism is a quite the apropos pairing. 

Maybe it wasn’t completely down to most voters going full-bore anti-women. DeSantis and his equally forced-birther batshit loony surgeon general reportedly ensured that Republicans hijacked as many taxpayer-funded resources as possible to spread misinformation about the amendment—even threatening lawsuits against TV stations for running pro-amendment ads. 

In Arkansas, the anti-choice Republican Secretary of State used a bogus standard to refuse to certify a similar measure for today’s ballot , then the state Supreme Court with a 4 forced-birther Justice majority proceeded to rubber-stamp the SOS’ chicanery. 

A bonus anti-women Arkansas factoid is that our Republican controlled  state has among the worst outcomes in the nation for infant mortality, but we’re the ONLY state which has refused to expand Medicaid postpartum insurance coverage from the bare minimum 60 days to 1 year. 

Our MAGA Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, refuses to support this common sense step while having the temerity to call Arkansas “the most pro-life state in the nation.”   

Huckabee Sanders continuously lied to the American people on Trump’s behalf as White House press secretary from 2017-2019, so rank dishonesty and demagoguery come quite naturally to our forced-birther governor.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

I just don't even know what to say now.  I don't even recognize the country anymore.  I feel like everything after 9/11 happened has just been upping the crazy every year besides the relative calm of the Obama presidency.  

Hopefully I'm wrong about how far this new government will take things, but I don't think people realize how close we are to an authoritarian government that we will never be able to step away from without a civil war.

"Hopefully they stop relying on abortion to flip white women to the party

Dumb ass Democrats clung on to abortion like idiots when the writing on the wall was clear it's the economy stupid. 

Furthermore states like FLA an MO have demonstrated they can vote for trump while supporting abortion through state level referendums. 

For example FLAs got to 58npercent of a needed 60 to overturn the abortion ban there. And Missouri literally succeeded. 

Like trump said, abortion is not the firebrand issue the Dems thought

And the vote shows that white women can vote based on their pocketbokk and still support abortion access....further trump said NO National Ban and return the issue to states to decide. As he predicted and I mention some were more liberal than we assumed 


Then as a black man I think how in our circles we talk about reparations. The say No reparations the best I can do for you is abortion.  Abortion just isn't the big issue


2. The disregard for the Palestine issue. No explanation needed

3. No plan for migrants. Spends years calling trump racist and ignore calls tomshut down border only to have Biden do it in the last half of 24. Signalling republicans were right all along. 

4.  Then I think of young men. When I went to college in 2013, all that rape culture, toxic masculinity white privilege stuff was just coming out and we found it a little weird then too. Ten years later, kids who grew up with it from their toddler years to now are over it . Manospnere people and Rogan not feeling it. Young men went trump 

Remember Bernie Bros 😂 😂 😂 

5. Latinos didn't care about trump attacks on migrants. The ones who can vote are already citizens 🤷🏿‍♂️. Why would they care about people who ""skipped the line""

6.. I could go on but this election effort from Dems just seems incompetent. 

I was poised to see trump lose popular but he shellacked her. This is a clear mandate. As a Kamala voter, I support Trump's win and hope he does well to help us all do better. His tone is victory speech was presidential and no I don't think he's gonna be a dictator. Yeah Dems, don't be hyperbolic next time and say more than I'm not him!",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"This is why you lost...

From a true independent voter w independent friends who talk these issues.

You don't win by calling the other side names an insults an trying to shame them into voting, for who you want.

Trying to silence 🔕 people voices thru downvotes an calling them racist if they disagree with you.
Are not winning strategies.

The polls always get it wrong, because the majority don't want to deal with being called names an slurs trying to talk politics.
With people who only parrot misquoted clips from main stream media.

So they stay silent out of frustration an don't want to be attacked.
Which is funny because the party always attacking  is the one always claiming to be victims of said attacks.

Basing everything off someone's race or sexual orientation is wrong.

The majority of people don't care what is in your pants or who touches it except for your pocketbook. 

Trying to explain economics to a college student vs a midlife homeowner is pointless.
This is why as people get older they slide right.

Once you have real world experience an wisdom not from a text book it changes your world view.

I was liberal in college... I slid right after learning how the world works in practicality not hypothetically. 

I'm an educated veteran that is a registered independent.
I vote policy over party.

My views tend to land more conservative.

Trump spoke about real world things that need changed.

Dems talked fear how the world was gunna end an that america is great right now..if you disagree with them Your a nazi an support hitler.

We need a good border 
We need to enforce laws on immigration.

I belive in a woman's right to choose let them do what they want..
Im also fine with let  the states decide.
What is controversial about leting people vote thats the entire point right..no one is baning stuff there voting on policy..go vote an change it.

I believe in LGBT freedoms who cares. I also believe you should not shove it in people's  face an call people names that disagree with you.

The left constantly name calling an fear mongering is what lost my vote.

Post after post on reditt an the media calling people every foul name you can think of for not agreeing with them.. lost my vote.

An ill be downvoted for this here on reditt because it's mostly a liberal site..I know this.

But I hope some of you read it an maybe just maybe stop calling people names that don't agree with you.

 Try an understand there issues not just ram home your own interests..politics is about compromise not demonize untill you get your way.

Listen ..the otherside is not demons or nazis there your friends an neighbors.
Not everything is racist or sexist an ist ect..just because someone does not like your ideas.

Because you chased away this vote ..an I hate that I had to vote Trump but you left me no other choice.

An no the lawsuits an all the other crap throw at Trump did not matter to me.
 It was very clear that it was political mud slinging. Just the fact that people chant 34 felonies..when it was 1 charge that was multiplied is a joke.

The sexual shit..read the lawsuits.
Dig in an read about the cases not just the headlines.
The stolen election lawsuits..read about it.They would not even hear most his cases because of the implications they didn't want the public to get about our elections.

The left claims to be so educated. But so few of you read or watch his speeches to see for yourself.

I watched the hrs long speeches on YouTube  an then saw how the media would misquote him an bam reditt would go nuts ..

That was really shocking to me ..to actually watch his speech an then see it misquoted an swallowed in real time!
That had a big infulance on me. I saw with my own eyes an ears things he said taken out of context.
You should go back an do some research not just swallow the headlines  an chant along.

Hopfully in 2028 there will be fresh young candidates..
An hopfully the left will stop being the party of hate an identity politics.

Im sure this is filled with spelling an Grammer issues..the left like to be pedantic on reditt.
If your saying  something they don't like.
If my writing is to bad for you to understand it doesn't matter..you didn't make it this far down anyway lol.

Goodluck to everyone",2024_11_07,00_28_37

…but what’s that got to do with the price of eggs?

Then, they failed to show how CHIPS/Inflation Reduction Act/Build Back Better has brought in jobs, projects, improvements etc to local areas. One such rural area has a whole new wing built to their High School as a result of one of these adds (heard it on the PBS election coverage earlier), and the people there has NO FLIPPING CLUE. 

Also. Georgia. She held to the 2020 playbook and went hard in the Urban votes .. but He went hard on the Rural votes. Behold. The South is Red again. 

On top of this, the Democrats have further failed to recognize that Immigration ALSO matters to other Hispanic/Latino as they don’t “Like Line jumpers”. Go back to Cesar Chavez. He was pro Union and didn’t want to allow in Mexican migrants to the farms who weren’t in the Union. Even though they’re all Latinos. “Tough shit. I got here the right way you do too!” type of thinking. Also, per exit polls Trump FINALLY won over Hispanic men. Something Biden did but she couldn’t. 

Also, no one was buying the “Threat to our Democracy” rhetoric. Likely because they’re more concerned with point 1 of my TedTalk.

"I was saying to my wife earlier that I think one of the problems (not the only, or even the biggest - that probably was ""the economy"" for this election) is that I think there is a real crisis going on with young men. Not that they should be entitled and given what they want, etc, but that they've seemingly been caught between a (valid, but then overly generalized) indictment of toxic masculinity on the left, and an acceptance of said actual toxic masculinity on the right.

Women's rights are absolutely crucial, and as the father of a daughter, I mourn what I'm seeing. At the same time, I think there is a degree to which the conversations have become exclusionary to young men, and that might even be valid in the abstract, but which has left them no place. The right wing manosphere welcomes them, and gains another convert.

I don't think the answer is to give up on women's rights or to give these men more privileges, but I think there is a very real void of positive masculinity and a place for these young men on the left that let's them be both accepted and positive parts of groups. Unfortunately, the toxic version of these things are also easier, it's so much easier to be entitled and then to simply be angry when you don't get what you want, so I don't know what the answer really looks like here, but I think this is a key aspect of the right wing propaganda machine you're describing.

To be sure, there are others (it's not all just young people nor men who get sucked in after all) but this seems like such a strong funnel.

I have a son as well as a daughter, and I ponder and worry about this because I want to protect them both from these phenomena.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

Biden should get credit for the economy but all he got was blame for inflation.  Harris took that blame when she took the mantle. 

Biden should have kept the more restrictive immigration policies and then advocated publicly and repeatedly about how Congress is actually the correct branch of the government to solve the problems of immigration.

Biden should have used leverage against Israel when the traumatic images started flashing across people's screens.  Very early on. He could have saved lives and it would have endeared the left to him.",2024_11_07,00_28_37

If we come to find out that Latino people were a key part of Trump's victory there will naturally be a desire to tell them they fucked around and are going to find out.

But if our response to people being mass deported is to shrug then the fascists win. To the extent it turns out to be true that Latino people voted against their own interests we should forgive them and show concern for their well-being.  

If the worst case comes to pass and Latino communities are getting ripped apart and people are being crowded into camps and sent to countries they haven't been in or over a decade they will already be punished.

That's what I hope comes out of MAGA's victory.  We have to decide what we really believe in and we need to recognize it as more than just a campaign talking point.  

We now have a shared enemy.  Both liberals and leftists oppose MAGA.  In order to fight MAGA we need to get past the blame game and find a way to fight together.  If we let this defeat turn us against one another it will only make the enemy stronger.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
Unfortunately it did but I think if the Dems did better at addressing it and really making it something they recognized as a concern. They glossed over it and said facts but that wasn’t enough they needed to lean in more. I think this also has to do with how short of a campaign Harris had which played against her. She was starting at a huge deficit and caught up as much as she could but couldn’t get passed the right wing noise.,2024_11_07,00_28_37

"no shit. this campaign seemed better than 2016 about intentionally *not* doing the ""omg yas kween i'm with herrr"" divisive gender identity politics bullshit and actually focus on *unifying* but ofc you can't stop everyone from trying to make it about that. it takes a coalition to win. there are plenty of (crucial) dudes who care about reproductive rights more than the women that are going out there voting for trump who aren't trying to hear that their the devil bc elon exists or there was an msg rally of incels or some shit. idk it's always pretty 🥱 when u see this angle pop up in this context but to each their own lol

it's kinda like if there's particularly high turnout among a group that doesn't usually vote as much and then they wanna single handedly claim that they brought the victory and it's everyone else's fault they're not normally ""energized"" by the candidates or some shit for why they don't vote like sorry hold your nose and do your duty like everyone else, it takes a village, if you want single handed credit for the one victory than thanks also for the nine losses that preceded it, idk man. the identity based shit never plays out as well as shooting for as broad and unified a coalition as possible but hey what do i know...",2024_11_07,00_28_37

"We are mobilizing and we are WINNING.     Tomorrow I hope everyone personally thanks a woman of color or a newcomer for saving democracy.    If you can, give a newcomer some money as a sign of appreciation.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
I’d literally be terrified if Trump won but latest polls show a considerable Kamala landslide!!,2024_11_07,00_28_37
Mobilize? Not with their legs that's for sure,2024_11_07,00_28_37
And got wrecked you ain't got nothing on the Don just let us be great again and go suck on a egg or something..,2024_11_07,00_28_37
I’m so genuinely terrified right now. I feel like I did the first time he won and everyone started to realize he was actually going to win.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
">I can’t even imagine how bad a Trump presidency would be for America.

Have a look at Project 2025. It's literally his unofficial platform.

That's how bad it will be for America.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"Exit polls make me nervous. I just saw 70% of people, so from exit polls are angry or dissatisfied coupled with Bidens terrible rating. Economy remains the main issue above Democracy. And electorate's memory that economy was good when Trump was around ( it was Obamas economy). I am beginning to feel Kamala has a hill to climb.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"No, it’s all so surreal to me right now… do people not give a damn about democracy anymore?",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"It would be the end of America,  that's not hyperbolic",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"yeah, I think he's gonna win.  and I actually think progressives are partially to blame for where we are now,  sick of reddit glorifying progressives.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"Minority vote can be in opposition to the gender vote. That's what the campaign failed to realize, and it showed.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
That isn't the worst idea.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
Seriously. Progressives mobilize? No...All Americans who want to say goodbye to Trump are mobilizing today.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
That’s not correct English. Looks like a bad attempt at translation.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
Yeah. Can’t stand them,2024_11_07,00_28_37
"Pretty much everyone hates progressives other than progressives.  this is just a reddit circle jerk article,",2024_11_07,00_28_37
I'm a progressive and I never bashed Harris and had few strong opinions on Biden.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
Exactly. The marching around screaming and slobbering Hamas chants and calling everyone a colonizer really helped too. SUPER popular with the American people… Thanks morons.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
Reddit is not usable with any large political event. It’s gonna be all bots and burners for the next week.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
nah so many of my super progressive friends arent voting for kamala. granted it’s california but this is still so dumb,2024_11_07,00_28_37
It appears that demographic didn’t show up…,2024_11_07,00_28_37
give them my thanks as well,2024_11_07,00_28_37
Yea you may want to see an updated map or two. A landslide is not in the books anymore.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
Or the night in 2019 when most of the mail in ballots were being counted and Trump was ahead when I went to bed. The weight of that feeling was enormous,2024_11_07,00_28_37
Uk has woken up to the same gut wrenching reality that we’ve not known since Brexit. Love from this side of the pond.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
"Luckily, regardless of your worries, you will see the good benefits of his presidency in time.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"I personally know at least one trumper that has flipped thanks to J6. Multiple high profile republicans have come out to line up behind Harris. That’s not happening in reverse. Trump already lost last time, and that was when his cult was at its most rabid. Now it’s been 4 years of mental decline, felonies, and fascistic threats to our democracy. Dude isn’t gaining votes. If Dems show up, Dems win, and turnout is way up. 


Have a little faith ",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"Not when they’re complacent and eating. 

People don’t care about anything except themselves and whether they are eating. It’s always been that way since we gathered in societies like this.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"Well, we’re gonna find out!",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"It failed because the right has fanatics and the left has apathy. Speak to any young person. They feel like they have no future. So many have no faith in either side and have just given up. Just because they go to a rally to see Beyoncé or whatever doesn’t mean they’ll vote. 
I don’t blame them. 

Plus boomers love trump and boomers are the biggest demographic.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
Trump lost,2024_11_07,00_28_37
"And all the super progressive friends I have are voting for her, turns out there are a lot of different people but historically every time actual numbers come out it turns out progressives are one of the most solid Dem votes and all they get in return is scorn.",2024_11_07,00_28_37
There are literally comments from progressives telling people in blue states to vote for Jill Fucking Stein.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
And that is because many women were too afraid to vote for Kamala due to threats from men.    Why else would so many women and bipocs vote against their best interests?,2024_11_07,00_28_37
It’s not over til it’s over.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
But the sunshine in the morning was so bright,2024_11_07,00_28_37
How'd that faith work out for ya?,2024_11_07,00_28_37
Record numbers of young voters across the board… nah people just got tired of being gaslit and called racist.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
"I hope he does. Doesn’t change the data coming in tho. It’s almost as if they spent 16bill on this election between both sides and nothing really changed. 

In Alexa Not doing Rogan as a reason someone voted for Trump isn’t great news",2024_11_07,00_28_37
"Nah. Voting is private. They wouldn’t know if they voted for Trump or Kamala.  They voted that way, because they wanted to.  Maybe women aren’t that much smarter than men after all…",2024_11_07,00_28_37
You sound afraid ,2024_11_07,00_28_37
No wonder Trump lost ,2024_11_07,00_28_37
It has been proven that yes women actually are much smarter than men.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
I think it was disproven last night…,2024_11_07,00_28_37
All that was proven last night is that women live in fear of men and suffer internalized misogyny.,2024_11_07,00_28_37
"Probably not a good idea to run a woman as a candidate then, since they fear men…",2024_11_07,00_28_37
