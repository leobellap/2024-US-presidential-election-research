"It would be interesting to see someone do a paper on the divorce rates that result from this election over the next four years. I feel depending how incredibly worse things become, those rate will spike. Especially, if and when prices go up and public schools shut down.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
I guess this year at dinner I'll get to say I'm thankful that my family is intelligent and empathetic enough to vote for anyone but Trump. ,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"My mom & dad both love Trump. My brother & I are the Trump haters. We finally decided to confront them this year and let them know how their unwavering support of a racist rapist for 8 years has made us feel. They were very patient and listened to us intently. They expressed regret for never considering our feelings before.

Just kidding, they blew up at us and cancelled the Holidays.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I saw a reel the other day that sort of articulated what many on the left are feeling. When these people call for 'unity' and 'keeping the peace,' what they actually mean is conformity and submission to their worldview. In their opinion, their 'side' won, so back into the kitchen and closets the rest of us go. 

Except it doesn't work like that unless we let them. I won't sit down and keep polite. What they want is inherently wrong, immoral even.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Sadly, I was thinking of visiting my dad in Texas this Christmas, but my brother has gone full MAGA since moving there in 2020. 

I thought he’d be happy trump got elected, instead I had 5 days of endless texts of hate until I finally blocked him.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
I know I do not enjoy being in the company of people who hate me to the point that they will vote for a man who promises to use the United States military to deal with me.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
About to watch all those Americans who said prices were high enough to warrant electing Trump go spend all their money on bullshit for Christmas.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
I'm staying at home with the dog on Thanksgiving for the first time in 30 years instead of spending it with my moms family in the rgv. Gonna cook us some nice steaks for Thanksgiving.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I think it's reasonable. I'd stick with a simple, quiet explanation. If she calls you dramatic, just go with a very level, ""I'm sorry. I can't see you the same way any more.""

FWIW, I also think your relatives are showing their hands. If they genuinely thought the economy was in such a critical place and Trump was so instrumental to turning it around that they had to face the grim reality of sacrificing the rights and safety of fellow citizens as the lesser of two very bad options, they would not be laughing and mocking the people who will suffer. They wanted that outcome.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Wednesday morning of last week my wife said that she doesn't know if she'll ever want to see my family again because voting for Trump is a direct attack on her freedoms. I totally get this sentiment even if people think it's hyperbolic. 

I saw so many people who I assumed were Trump supporters or openly Trump supporters posting shit like ""We can still be friends despite our political differences <3 :)"". No, saying women should die because you made abortion illegal isn't a political difference. How do they not get this?",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Yup.  Can't imagine celebrating while being among people who proudly voted for a felon, rapist, and traitor.

Edit:  Though this year, I am probably done with being polite.  They seem to like it when people tell it like it is, so if you tell me you voted for Trump, I'm happy to tell you that you're a fucking idiot.  ""Hey, nice Nativity scene.  You realize you voted for the guy who would have deported Joseph and Mary, right?""",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"If my spouse had voted for trump I would be questioning her core beliefs.  

This isn't about politics, it's about character.  

If she could have voted for a person with the character of donald trump that would make me question her character.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Trump’s policies are so polarizing, his behavior is so disgusting, that we all know it ended relationships and marriages during his first presidency. And most likely it will happen again. 

The problem isn’t just that one spouse or one partner votes for one party and the other votes for another. Fundamentally, the policies, the attitudes, the stance on climate change, human rights, criminal accountability, women’s autonomy, are so diametrically opposed, it is hard to find any common ground, if any.  

It’s not just opposing views, it is the silo of views. The media machines have churned out polar opposite views on everything, making it next to impossible to have a healthy conversation. 

There’s also the reality on the ground that in 2024, women are dying, because they’re being denied emergency care for reproductive health. One side does not see a problem with that and one side does. These are very serious issues that are hard to get past.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"My extremely MAGA family who lives in rural bucks county asked me what dates I’d be home for Christmas this year. I told them I wasn’t coming. The last time I went back there I got harassed by strangers for having Massachusetts plates. The ignorant bunch just associate me with liberal politics and not as a human being. I can only imagine it’s going to be far worse this time around, and quite frankly, I’d rather be alone than around a dinner table where everyone is praising a psychopath who brainwashed enough Americans into becoming president. 

Not to mention they voted against my rights. As a gay person, I’m extremely concerned about the rhetoric and enablement that homophobes, and other bigoted minds are going to get out of this administration. I don’t really feel safe anymore.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"If politics were only about where to budget tax money and deficits and stuff, there wouldn't be any issue coexisting at Thanksgiving. But we are talking human rights and the future of democracy here!",2024_11_14,05_43_09
I unironically had a “Friendsgiving” cancelled because the host didn’t think people would be able to get along and be around each other because a couple in the group voted for Trump.,2024_11_14,05_43_09

"Republicans don't understand humanity. 

You didn't win cultural dominance. You didn't win freedom from consequences. You didn't even win authoritarianism. You won a happy fee-fee on election night. 

Your family will not suddenly transform into a fictional 1950's tv show. You won't suddenly be promoted to the c-suite at work. Your win was shallow and short-term. Now you reap the consequences.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I'm starting to distance myself from talking any politics at all. I know I can't change their minds on anything, and honestly I'm worried that things I say now will be used against me in the future.

Family thinks I'm a traitor. They could be a danger to me. All of them cult members. No more contact.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Aren't they going after no fault divorce as well? I would get that underway before the admin gets in. You can always live with him afterwards but at least you have freedom to leave.,2024_11_14,05_43_09

"I’m thankful that I already cut out all my toxic family members. I’m doing Thanksgiving and Christmas, but it’s just me, my husband and son. I’m actually looking forward to it.

My husband didn’t vote for Trump. I don’t think I could stay married to him if he did.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I’m going to keep saying it. We can have different opinions on politics. It’s the fact that we now live in a world where sexual assault, felonies, blatant racism, blatant homophobia are all non deal breakers for so many Americans. These are moral values not political views. All sexual assault victims and survivors now have to live with the fact that their predators can become the president.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Honestly, I knew I was already very privileged to have a family without divorced parents, but now I realize I have a unicorn family - we like each other, want to spend time with each other, and not one treasonous dumb fuck in the bunch.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Trump is just the end game for a process that has been going on for almost 50 years. A process that has been repeated time and time again for 4000 years of history. Once the ultra rich band together to grab power through racism and xenophobia it's almost never been stopped.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I've heard people respond to reactions like this like, ""how could you cut off family because of who they voted for"" and really it comes down to it's not because of WHO they voted for it's WHAT they voted for..",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"This was inevitable. 

For the past decade MAGA have destroyed every norm and convention in US society, but enjoyed the positives because everyone else just accepted it. The perfect example is “Trump lose = Rigged election” but “Trump win = Fair election.” They wanted to have their cake and eat it too. 

Now everyone else have finally dropped the decorum and are prioritising their own peace. It’s finally affecting the day to day life of MAGA, and they don’t like it.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Well Trump voters have made it clear that they hate us for the past 10 years. Why should we entertain them when we could be doing something healthy?,2024_11_14,05_43_09
I’ve canceled every single one of my Trump relatives.  We usually have a whole family Thanksgiving gathering but we are done with that for the rest of our lives.,2024_11_14,05_43_09

Divorce him while you still can.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"My grandpa has cancer again. My family was planning on flying in from all over the country to see him, but I don't think we will. He's totally a MAGA hat. While I love him a lot, I am in the closet around him, and none of his kids want to talk to him for more than a few minutes in person. Before Trump, he was a very interesting man with lots of lovely knowledge. Now, all he talks about is such awful things.

Concerning the article, I do hope she divorces him. I understand that Reddit is all about divorce, but I feel like this is just such a sad way to live. He'll never understand why people hated that he voted for Trump - and I don't think living your one life with a person who clashes so much with your ideas is a good way to go through things.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Speaking of Thanksgiving, I've worked at a Tyson plant before (Tyson Turkeys). It's pretty ironic as to whom works those plants. Immigrants!!!! Full of them.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"To anyone reading this who does not support Trump and resonates with this article, don't let the people posting here make you feel like you're the bad person. You have a right to feel the way you do. There's a lot of gaslighting MAGAs/pod people in this thread. Stick to your convictions and know there are many out there feeling outrage and utter disappointment in their friends and family who voted for him.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Maybe divorce the husband as well while no fault divorces still exist.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Same. Wife is furious she will lose her student loan public service forgiveness (if the dept of education gets gutted)and Im about to lose my health insurance (if the ada gets gutted). Its infuriating that we are about to get booted out of the middle class and she doesnt want to spend time with people that celebrate that. And since every single member of her family (minus her mom) are truck nut maga hat loud supporters, they can go enjoy things with each other.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

I don't want this maga bs in my life.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
We all need to do this. I have already arranged for Thanksgiving and Christmas with real Americans. Traitors can feed themselves together while they celebrate violence against their neighbors Make jokes about who they’re going to keep as slaves,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"My bf’s family (not him) thinks I’m rejecting god and denying him like Judas because I don’t agree that Trump winning is good. Apparently Trump winning was gods protection. Prob skipping out Christmas.

"A Latino voted for Trump.  Wow.  What a surprise that is.   Macho males?  Latino on latino hate?    I don't know a lot about the culture.  I do get that there is a whole male macho, ""I'm not gay"", ""libs are gay"" mindset (from black, brown and white males).    I'm male and don't want to have anything to do with those males.

My (F) wife's (..F..) all votes for Trump. They are educated people. They have great careers. The only reason they can give is Gaza and Economy and literally nothing has made them question him. My SIL openly admits she hates Trump but Gaza and Economy..🤮 I'm so fucking enraged. They keep insisting all the generic lies like he's not going to really do X Y Z. Thank God we don't have to do Thanksgiving or anything with them this year.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I canceled a cruise paid for by my trump dad who I haven’t talked to in 15 years. He’d be there too with his holier than thou wife. Up until a week ago, I was going with my husband, but now I want nothing to do with him and her. 

My dad and the rest of the trumpy family had previously turned their back on me and his own brother because we’re liberal. I despise them all. He wanted to see me one last time on this cruise. No thank you, bye! I was just using him to go on a nice cruise, our first, but there would be too much drama.

Only my mom and my husband’s mom are reasonable. My husband’s family also drank the kool aid, so he cut them all out.

We’ll go on our own trip with no strings attached.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

Also... we have been saying over and over, for everyone to vote, because democracy

Beyond the headline, good article though (seriously advise people to read the whole thing).

It hurts my feelings more than I can say that my parents voted for things that will hurt my children. They are very elderly and frail and need their children’s help and we don’t feel like giving it. It’s so very sad.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
So many apologists in here mistaking human rights for “politics”.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Yep. Half my family’s pissed because we’re not sitting at the table with Nazis.

One day, when people ask how the US could go from Obama to Hitler so fast, it’s because we let it into our homes. Piece by piece Let the Nazis sit there at holidays…you’re family. You’re more important than politics.  The Nazis never felt that way though…..",2024_11_14,05_43_09

My in laws voted for trump despite the fact I’m an immigrant and a teacher and he wants to make both of those harder yet my wife doesn’t think we should just spend thanksgiving elsewhere,2024_11_14,05_43_09
This is why I believe we must continually and consciously maintain our inner circles. Blood is meaningless if one fundamentally opposes some family members' humanity.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Every single person that voted for that man is an enemy of democracy. I would rather spend the holiday alone than pretend their insanity is excusable.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
I would probably break up with my partner if she voted for Trump. It would be difficult to stay with someone when you lose all respect for that person who voted to fuck over both our lives.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Good. Cut the fascists out of everything like a cancer,2024_11_14,05_43_09
We are now in the beginning stages of totalitarianism. This is just the honeymoon phase people are happy they feel they made the right decision. I’m sure the people of Iran felt the same way after their revolution. The Chinese after the Mao revolt. The Russians after the Bolshevik revolt. The Germans after voting for Hitler. It’s been  decades since these events and still the reverberations are being felt by their people. I’m old maybe 15-20 years left. The young ones are who I cry for the most. They have to endure the most pain and suffering. The fools who brought us to the precipice of the impending events do not understand where we are headed. I look forward to being proven wrong I truly do. Sadly human nature will in the end prove me right.,2024_11_14,05_43_09

"That’s probably a wise decision.  You know yourself best and I trust that you haven’t made this decision lightly.

My family knows where I stand.  One of them hates going to my house because they have to walk by a pride flag to get in.  He tried to make fun of me calling me ""gay"" (I'm straight).  I told him I frankly don't care what he may think my sexuality is.

We live in a country where people love their sky-gods based on faith, but hate the people that clearly exist right here in front of them.  Then there's a group of people that simply couldn't be bothered to show up and vote because of apathy.  Shame on both of those groups.

"But didn’t the Evangelicals say that behavior will be more righteous under Trump?

…wait… now I see what they meant by ‘no-fault’ divorce…

If God wanted people to be more righteous, he’d tell us how to be, directly word-for-word. Too bad he already tried that, and a majority of Evangelical dipshits would still cancel Jesus if he returned today. It’s why I don’t take the whole “it’s God’s Will” lecture so seriously.

Like, if it’ll be “God’s Will” when sinful and blasphemous communities to be destroyed, why are all the hurricanes and floods passing up California or New York? It’s almost as if they’re missing the parts of the U.S. that spreads hatred, blasphemy, greed…… hol up… I think I understand “God’s Will” now.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"I've been saying it for years; Trump is a permission slip for people to be their worst selves openly.

Sadly, I think the answer is that the country as a whole is much more misogynist and racist than I thought it could be.

Trump will inherit a thriving economy. He hates the success of Biden. They thought he would get rid of Obamacare, which, ironically, will hurt most of them. Under Obamacare, my premium is down to $90 per month. My car insurance is down to $25/month (from InsurancePanda). My homeowners is $25/month (from homesite) too. Trump will destroy it all.

"For a relationship to thrive, both parties need to be in agreement on two things: goals; and values.

(I liken this to trying to drive a car with two steering wheels: nothing can be accomplished unless both parties agree on (a) the direction the car is going in, and (b) the appropriate course of action to take when encountering obstacles.)

The problem here is that some couples are discovering that they do not, in fact, share similar values after all.

(As the phrase goes: “We can agree to disagree on whether to raise or lower taxes; we cannot agree to disagree on whether people are people”.)

Now, it is worth noting that Trump voters are not a monolith; and for every bigot clamoring for minorities to be harmed, there is a deeply uninformed, financially-anxious voter that was taken in by Trump’s promises of economic prosperity.

To be clear: casting a vote for Trump without performing even the tiniest degree of due diligence (and by extension, learning of his various crimes, failings, and threats) is still a serious cause for concern in a relationship. However, this is a solvable problem.

"He is their excuse to act like the bullies they all want to be like. They see how successful their school year bullies are on Facebook and see that they were right. So they get to be bullies now. Only the target is their kids and grandkids.

This was a race of ""I"" versus ""We"". You really could see it when people would ask Trump supporters when asked about horrible things Trump said. They have personal reflection saying they know they shouldn't do that, but if Trump does it and wins, well he will do it for them and they are absolved of their sins and vindicated in their self-righteousness with no skin in the game. They really think Trump won't hurt them. ""He won't hurt me, just them."" But we all know someone that will be hurt. And deep down they believe those people deserve it but they won't say it out loud.

I got my parents to say it out loud to me. Now I keep them at arms length. They were always about ""I deserve more"" and never had a thought of ""we"" except in the context of their race. They were trained to be not explicitly racists, but to have prejudice. Some of them are old enough to have experienced integration. They believe that the violence from that was the black peoples' fault. They saw how useful bullies were in that context. They love bullies because they protect them from the other. 

And the fact that the boomer generation is largely on Facebook and their communities these days really focus on their school years, they are naturally going to reencounter their bullies. This is why they are acting like school children again, because the bullies never changed and the schoolyard is now Facebook. Their stories of old are all having the facade torn down. They weren't Ralphie standing up to Scott Farkas in the Christmas Story, they were the toady and Ralpie's brother. And they still fantasize about fighting Black Bart. And they are so immaturely cowardish that they can't even be honest with their children who are now adults. 

We have always been living in their society. In 2008 it was the first time they felt like they lost control and were told by the bullies that the Marxists were taking over. They did take America Back. Back to the Integration Days where they hope this is all settled once and for all, and the bullies will then do the dirty work again for them.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"""As plans to deports detaints migrants stall, Trump signs into law new, 'make prisons great again' legislation, increasing areas inmates can be used as outsourced labor. Private prisons will now be allowed to lease out their labor to more companies than ever before, filling need vacancies in (insert job mostly done by migrants here).

As a part of this new legislation, migrants rounded up by ICE, police departments, and national guards of red states around the country will be put to work as a part of contract given to the private prisons holding them near the border indefinitely while they await deportation.""



I believe something along these lines to be the end goal. I think law enforcement and private citizens emboldened by extremist rhetoric will be the ones who do most of the work for the administration, not the military. The military will be too busy with infighting as Trump loyalists are put into positions of power and try and get rid of the old guard.

Of course, the companies and billionaires that helped to get Trump elected want their cheap labor that illegal immigrants provide, so they will contract out prisoners to pick the crops instead. When attempts at deportation inevitably stall out, those in detention centers will end up doing the same labor they came over for in the first place, but as prisoners getting paid functionally nothing. The private prisons that will be contracted to hold the immigrants will get paid doubly by leasing out the labor and getting fat contracts.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

> With Adolf Hitler's approval, Adolf Eichmann released a memorandum on 15 August 1940 **calling for the resettlement of a million Jews per year for four years**, with the island being governed as a police state under the SS. They assumed that many Jews would succumb to its harsh conditions should the plan be implemented. The plan was not viable when proposed due to the British naval blockade. It was postponed after the Nazis lost the Battle of Britain in September 1940, and **it was permanently shelved in 1942 with the commencement of the Final Solution, the policy of systematic genocide of Jews, towards which it had functioned as an important psychological step**.

About a hundred unsuspecting [Ba'athist party](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bath-Party) members sat listening to their newly installed president, [Saddam Hussein](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saddam-Hussein), denouncing a conspiracy against him.

>Suddenly a man was brought before the conference, bearing the marks of torture and the vacant expression of a broken mind and soul. [Muhyi Adbek Hussein](https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle-2-15039/the-real-saddam-1-617460), one of the senior Ba’athist leaders, proceeded to confess his role in a plot to overthrow Saddam’s new regime and name his alleged co-conspirators.

"If you mean Trump, he's an endlessly entitled narcissist at an advanced state of dementia. He said during the campaign that he'd end the war in a day. Reportedly he told Putin not to escalate, which was not taken well. I can completely imagine Trump believing that his campaign promises will become true when he just tells Putin so. And Putin, for his part, is an equally entitled narcissist, who does not seem demented, but who has been highly isolated and surrounded by yes-people for many years now. He's not about to be told how to run his war. I don't think the phone call went well, which is why both sides are denying it took place at all.

This is what I mean by not working for the Russians. Trump was always only interested in his own perceived advantage, and his own money. He can certainly be manipulated, but he's not entirely predictable, and doesn't actually know or understand anything about the reality of the war.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"I literally cannot fathom that before Jan 6, the largest armed invasion of the US Capitol building was during the War of 1812.

It's absolutely batshit insane that the next time it would happen, the attack was instigated by the SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Who, far from being convicted of high treason, instead faced ZERO consequences for his actions and was indeed REWARDED a mere four years later, with a WILLING RE-ELECTION TO THE PRESIDENCY.

Oh and all those people who actually attacked and invaded the capitol that day? Yep, they're all getting pardoned for the attack, by that same President.

What the actual fuck is real life anymore?

"Trump got away with everything because the people at the highest levels of the justice system were literally too scared to do their jobs.  I heard multiple times either, we have a tradition of not indicting a sitting president (Mueller) or heard them say that they did not want to appear biased (Garland). So since it’s not a rule or law they actively CHOSE not to do their job, and not wanting to appeared biased is not their job.  They’re job was not to worry about what others with think their motivations are, their job is to enforce the law and everyone can feel how they want about it.  People worked to get to positions of power and then found every excuse not to do their job, not because I think they secretly wanted to help Trump or some other conspiracy, but rather because they simply thought it would look bad, that’s it. 

I think Jack Smith was one of the few that did their job without any excuses, even while he had a biased judge clearly sabotaging the case.  I hope history remembers him for his integrity and respect for his job and I hope it remembers judge Aileen Cannon for turning her back on her duties and the country. 

Just adding this last part, what I always told people is that the one thing I gave Trump credit for was that he would just do things and if they didn’t work then they didn’t work, but if they did it benefitted him, so why did the Justice Dept always have excuses of, well we don’t want to do this or that because it’s never been done before.

"Well, there's no way I'm ever getting picked for jury service again.  I have my answer if I'm asked if there's any reason why I would not be able to impartially render a verdict.

Our country will be run by a felon who's crimes have been effectively forgiven by our courts and the voters.  The voters have additionally empowered him to pardon his accomplices and punish those who dared to investigate his crimes.  The top court in the land has granted him permission to violate the law in the future, as long as he uses his official powers to coordinate the crime.  The Senate refused to convict him twice and will continue to protect him.

At this point, all three branches of government, as well as the majority of voters, have declared that some people are not subject to the rule of law.  We have completed our transition from the rule of law to the rule of men.

If the felon-President and his accomplices are not subject to the law, why should a juror feel obligated to interpret the facts of a trial in good faith?  In this new America, the law is just where pretexts are found to justify doing whatever serves your personal interests.  A juror would be equally justified in using their power to convict or acquit in the way that best serves their interests, regardless of whether or not a defendant actually broke the law.

Merrick Garland will get him - This one's on Biden. Biggest mistake of his term, and possibly one of the biggest mistakes any President has ever made by consequence.

Jack Smith will get him - Jack Smith's case is a slam dunk. No legal arguments exist to refute what he put forward. Why did nothing come of it? Two reasons. (1) The Supreme Court invented immunity for Trump. (2) Aileen Cannon (a Trump-appointed judge) threw the case out because she claimed that the AG did not have the authority to appoint a special counsel. In other words, the SC has been fully captured by the Rebpublican party (because Democrats failed in 2016) and Aileen Cannon is a bought-and-paid-for spineless traitor and likely the next SC justice.

All of those are examples which are confirmed by their enemies, while the Roman empire and earlier ones lasted well over 250 years but due to the less consistent use of writing you have to take their word on how old their origins are. Though with archaeology we know of dynasties in Egypt which lasted over 250 years, and are why we have written-in-stone Laws of Maat.

I remember when even the GOP changed their entire strategy to be more local based in organization and office running which resulted in the Tea Party.

And then the Tea Party used Trump to take over the GOP and since then it is just the rich that matter with millions and millions of dollars going into every major campaign. Then the only thing that kept mattering was how much money each politician was raising because it was an arms race with now much you could spend advertising.

"Oh for sure.  I only put the pin at Reagan as up until then in our modern post industrialist reality, conservatism was a flailing ideology.  Being honest about their platform is what lead to Goldwater's embarrassing defeat.  Nixon did get some damage through (also including his damaging role with the War on Drugs), but also had to cater to progressive policies like the EPA due to those types of policies being very popular within the U.S.  Where I'm zeroing in on is when Jude Wanniski, a Republican strategist, pushed forward the Two Santas Strategy and Supply-Side economics, which started a new era of Republicanism marked with bad faith politics and subversion of government.  This started squarely with Reagan.

[The Two Santas Strategy: How the GOP has used an economic scam to manipulate Americans for 40 years | Milwaukee Independent](https://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/thom-hartmann/two-santas-strategy-gop-used-economic-scam-manipulate-americans-40-years/)

Reagan also signaled a new era for Republicanism as well on propaganda, with the establishment of FOXNews, a network specifically designed to ensure a Republican would never be held accountable by the public again like Nixon was:  [How Roger Ailes Built the Fox News Fear Factory](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/how-roger-ailes-built-the-fox-news-fear-factory-244652/)

It's with Reagan, our reality shifted into this sandbox where blatant corruption and disregard of the Rule of Law now became palatable and not a detriment to Republican frontrunners.  Where a Republican president could lie...blatantly lie...and still be adored for generations due to the illusion of success while stealing from our future, and a propaganda machine hammering that narrative repeatedly.  Or in Reagan's own words:

This has a lot to do with zoning regulations and livable cities. 

Japan, you can walk to a store in most places. If you can't get there by foot, they have reliable, good public transportation.

With regards to medicine, specifically, we pay more because we're the only country where our government can enforce patent law on the medication.

Nothing left to lose now, go protest! Except now you're homeless from losing your job, and many states have enacted laws to jail homeless populations for pretty much just existing.

And by putting a curfew on things it limits the ability for protests to build night over night as you see in many other countries.

Also as such a geographically-spread country, it isn't as easy for those protesters to converge on the capital as they might in a country that is smaller in land area.

The police, FBI, DHS, and NHS collude directly with the capitalist class to suppress any sort of meaningful organization.

If you protest, we have plenty of room in the prisons, and direct action catches terrorism charges and decades of prison time, even for tame acts of non violent resistance. Heavily armed men in riot gear will kick down your door in the middle of the night, shoot your dog and brutalize your family for things like \*checks notes\* organizing a bail fund, and no one will come to your aid.

Replace everyone in government with sycophants. If he fires, jails, or kills anyone that opposes him, this is the definition of a coup.


Everyone needs to wake the fuck up right now. The people who voted for him had no fucking clue what they were voting for. This was on purpose.


Look at the number of people wanting to change their votes, not knowing if Biden is still running, people who think Harris had no platform. This is intentional misdirection and disinformation on a scale we haven't seen since the Cold War.


We have been duped. The sooner we realize this, the sooner we can take action.


We need everyone to fix this mess. That includes dumbasses who voted for it.


Please for the sake of our country, throw away these stupid, selfish, individualistic tendencies. Now is not the time to seek comfort. Now is the time to fight.


Start communities. Join all your social groups together in one coalition. Talk about difficult subjects like workers' right, abortion, healthcare for all. We need to start talking again.


Extremism grows in isolation. Surround yourself with community and spread the word.

"Trans women in sports was a master stroke of ""How to cleave off moderate support""

First, lets be clear, all of the anti-trans fervor was a republican-lead attack, to create a boogeyman they could run on taking out. Lawsuits were filed in lock-step after they lost gay marriage as an issue.

They tried bathrooms, it didn't work. Then they tried sports.

It was brilliant, because it preys on moderates by making liberals look ""too extreme"".

The logic that is pushed is ""Men are stronger than women and better in sports -> ""?????"" -> THEREFORE, Trans women shouldn't compete against cis women""

The ??? is, of course ""Trans women are really men, sooo"" - which resonates, even with moderates/center-leaning liberals. ""Trans women are men but we call them she/her and use their chosen name because it makes their lives easier""

So to people who's ""support"" of trans people is paper-thin, it's easy to say ""WOKE LIBERALS are RUINING women's sports by letting MEN compete against them! Woke insanity!!!""

But the reality is, of course, so much more nuanced. If a kid was able to access appropriate interventions at puberty, they'd have zero advantages over a cis woman

In fact, trans women generally have LESS testosterone in their system than even cis women do - and T is a notorious performance enhancer. 

The question shouldn't be ""do trans women have ANY advantages AT ALL?"" it should be ""Do the sum of their advantages and disadvantages put them in the rough bell curve of other categories of women?"" And the answer most sporting bodies found was ***YES***, after 1-2 years of HRT depending on prior training level and upkeep regimen.

But this is all too nuanced, and most people don't think about topics that much. They just think ""Trans women = men, men = better than women at sports, ergo letting trans women play = unfair""

Which, it's fucking WILD that policy affecting 1% of the population is SO DAMN IMPORTANT that it be put front and center of the REPUBLICAN'S CAMPAIGN, and somehow Kamala is the one blamed for playing ""Woke politics"" too much.

For trump it could go either way, to be honest.

If people do break, they're going to break \_hard\_.

I imagine there are definitely contingency plans in place, too. If FOX, for example, suddenly got the order from the heritage peeps that it was ""time to shed the demagogue"", they could pump out a lot of anti-trump stuff very quickly, with the added bonus that all of it would be true.

This miiiight sway folks, but on the other hand, a lot of them might be too far gone that they would reject it in favour of their comforting orange deity. We saw this with FOX calling arizona in 2020, for example: they didn't accept FOX, they ran to OANN for more palatable lies.

The GOP wanted trump simply as a route to power, but have instead chained themselves irrevocably to a vengeful moron, and turned their entire voter base into a cult for that moron. Will they try to cut their losses before everything burns, or cling to power AS everything burns?

"One salient but gaslighting point the Orange guy made during his otherwise lackluster debate with Kamala... 

He is apparently *proud* of the fact that so many of the people he hired and worked with during his first administration are angry with him and going around trash talking him. He sees that as evidence that he's a good leader; he's not afraid to fire people who do a bad job. He claimed that the current administration lets people failing at their jobs stay on. He also claimed that all the folks who worked for him who are now telling us he is incompetent and awful are just salty because they got fired. 

IMHO most any other competent leader would be embarrassed that he hired folks who couldn't do their jobs and would share some level of responsibility for the failures of the teams he assembled.

"Absolutely.  It 100% has lasting damage to the brain.  Furthermore, If you think of COVID-19 as not just a disease, but a powerful weapon to weaken a nation, the anti-vax movement among the compromised right wing makes a lot more sense.  This encapsulates the timeline of events and talking points with COVID-19, vaccine development, and information warfare by Russia.  

In early 2020, as COVID-19 spread globally, Kremlin-backed disinformation campaigns seized the moment to divide, destabilize, and weaken the U.S. and other democratic societies. Early on, these campaigns focused on amplifying distrust in government health measures, framing the virus response as a loss of personal freedom. This groundwork of mistrust set the stage for what was to follow.

When COVID-19 vaccines were developed in late 2020, Kremlin-backed media and influencers began promoting narratives that the vaccines were “rushed,” “experimental,” and even dangerous. This rhetoric was echoed by select right-wing influencers in the U.S., who aligned vaccine skepticism with broader ideological themes of personal freedom and anti-establishment sentiment. By positioning vaccination as a partisan issue, these efforts deepened divides within American society.

As the Delta variant emerged in mid-2021, disinformation emphasized breakthrough cases to undermine confidence in vaccine efficacy, even as vaccines continued to prevent severe illness. When mandates and boosters rolled out, anti-vaccine narratives intensified, arguing that these measures were government overreach. This approach further entrenched vaccine resistance in certain communities, leading to ongoing waves of infection.  

Through this coordinated misinformation, the Kremlin achieved three goals:

1.  Sowed division by turning public health into a polarizing political issue.
2.  Degraded US capabilities by extending the pandemic’s impact, straining healthcare resources, and slowing economic recovery, not to mention impairing the US ability to provide aid and assistance to Ukraine.
3.  Exacerbated the disease’s impact by encouraging vaccine hesitancy, leading to more severe cases and lasting health issues, including potential cognitive impacts, some of which include impaired memory, emotional regulation issues, and paranoia.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

We heard the tapes of him sharing top secret documents with strangers to disprove General Miley news segment that morning. 

We saw the text where he asked his lawyer to lie to the FBI about the documents being returned and then when the warrant was executed the plethora of documents showed he was lying. 

We know he was talking to Putin pre election something he denied in 2016. 

We know he’s been doing business as has his daughter and son-in-law with Saudi post his loss. 

We know he and Elon broke some election laws and them calling Ukraine and other moves post election are probably illegal. 

He’s a convicted felon who won’t get sentenced. Most felons aren’t so lucky, especially male black men who suffer harsher penalties for crimes.

He posted on social media that pardons from Trump “would be amazing,” and added hashtags with the names of those accused to reporting mentioning his private lobbying of the then-president.

The effort was successful, with Trump that year pardoning a former U.S. Army commando set to stand trial in the killing of a suspected Afghan bomb-maker, as well as a former Army lieutenant convicted of murder for ordering his men to fire upon three Afghans, killing two. Trump also ordered a promotion for a decorated Navy SEAL convicted of posing with a dead Islamic State captive in Iraq.”

"It's a leadership school, and costs the unit $40 in addition to DTS travel. 

Maybe if it had leadership schools instead of fancy collars, ship-borne deployments, and pretending everyone was an infantryman, the marine corps could graduate beyond naval infantry into a land force with 21st century relevance. 

Anyway, jokes aside, ranger school is about meeting a bottom level of competency and grit for maneuver officers. It's not actually a ranger regiment thing, it's a 2 month suck fest to help these dudes/dudettes prove to themselves and others that they won't quit when things suck, and that they aren't shitty people with morale-crushing personalities. Also something deserves to be said about building stress tolerance and small unit tactics and skills. Think of it less like ""you're a ranger now"" and more like ""you've demonstrated you are now competent as a light infantryman.""

Airborne is a cool school. It's honestly just a cool badge for everyone not in an airborne unit. 

As far as officer training being 7 months, that's about what it is between infantry BOLC, MLC, and ranger. It's roughly equivalent in terms of shittiness.

">crass

Oh yes, that was the intent. It's also on the surface hilariously false and misrepresented, given the theater that's becoming important as we transition away from the middle east. 

If we're including OCS, then that's a whole other kettle of fish. IBOLC, MLC, and ranger only happen to infantry officers once they commission. Commissioning routes, as you probably know, vary from 16 weeks federally (including BCT) to 56sh weeks for guard OCS, to 200+ weeks for ROTC. It's not worth bringing into the conversation. 

Bottom line, the pipelines are extremely comparable between services. They both produce infantry officers, and the joint force overlords care little about service, only capability. The difference lies in how one froths at the mouth about their blue cords and willingly calls themselves the ""queen of battle.""

Put it this way, I feel very neutrally about marines. I like them much better than the vast majority of coalition forces I've had the displeasure of training with.

The insult is that he’s a part time major instead of someone who knows the pentagon and the intricacies of the department of defense. This is a part timer who isn’t even in a real command position yet (Director of operations is usually Major, you don’t really get commander positions until lieutenant colonel or colonel) and he’s about to take charge of a VAST military intelligence structure and geopolitical system. The pentagon is where deconfliction calls take place. It’s where special operations are planned and intelligence is synthesized in order to make those missions happen.

Being untabbed is just icing on the cake for the simple reason that this guy just has no idea what infantry is like aside from stories. If he was like an Air Force military intelligence colonel that might also be true but he’d at least have leadership experience and understand the experience to some degree.

What’s more likely is he was chosen because he isn’t qualified and won’t argue anything if Trump tells him to do something. If he’s qualified and the president says some wild shit he might say something like “Mr President, I can’t condone that course of action due to these reasons” but this guy is gonna have to hear a Trump order and kind of go “okay” and just walk into the next room and be like “okay guys so the President said this let’s do it lmao”.

The US military is VERY flexible for these things. Trump was already the top military guy being Commander and Chief. His word is really law on the military. It’s why we have a space force at all.

 - Jews only saw Biden/Harris support for Gaza.
 - Working people only saw fake news about inflation and the economy.
 - Trans/LGBTQ anti-propaganda was aimed at all who were uncomfortable with freedom of choice.
 - Similar selective targeting went on around the abortion issue.

Do I have proof about this? Only the proof of my eyes. Elon fired the people at Twitter who programmed the algorithm to be somewhat fair. Those who use Twitter saw many signs the algorithm had been rigged in favor of Trump.

Trump has probably been sold on the notion that his popularity is entirely dependent on Musk's whims, _and it might be true._ If so, Musk will never have to leave.

1. Purge the US military of trans soldiers. They will all be told to present as the gender they were born with or get discharged. 
2. Focus on military infrastructure for camps. Specifically, detaining undocumented persons. 
3. Officer purge of people who aren't loyal. Likely put them on shit duty to get them out of the way or fire them.
4. Once that infrastructure is put in place, then you have the means to focus on the ""enemy within.""

That's 154 million votes, only a million votes less than in 2024. So maybe one million ""democrats"" stayed home while just over three million actively switched their vote to Trump. 

Okay, not really. I suppose you could have four million democratic voters staying home and three million new voters coming out for Trump. But in no scenario did ten million democrats stay home.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

Got tomatoes in July?  ""Ha! Remember those tomatoes are a Chinese hoax.  Don't believe your lying eyes. Yeah yeah the climate is always changing.""

Insurance companies leaving Florida?  Gosh, that's the free market at work right there. Not climate change.  Why do people there hate science and facts?  Guess they are experiencing the consequences of their choices.""

>At the same time these internal memos were being circulated, fossil fuel executives from the same companies were publicly downplaying their industry’s role in the climate crisis, and its connection to extreme weather. 

>In 1988, after a particularly hot summer, oil corporations began to plan their public relations strategy for climate change. In an internal memo in August of that year, an Exxon spokesperson advised leadership to “emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions” and work with key government agencies, including the United Nations, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency.

>In the following decades, fossil fuel companies would run advertising campaigns, write policy, and influence scientific reports to hide the link between fossil fuels and extreme weather. That climate denial is still happening today, as oil giants spend billions delaying any action that will phase out fossil fuels while greenwashing their polluting projects. 

>As recently as 2015, internal emails obtained by The Wall Street Journal revealed that Exxon executives were still asking scientists to cast doubt on climate science and its connection to natural disasters. Last year, fossil fuel companies sent a record 2,456 lobbyists to the United Nations annual climate summit to influence negotiations. And most recently, the U.S. Senate Budget Committee found that the fossil fuel industry is still misleading the public about its efforts to mitigate the climate crisis, while privately admitting it can’t meet its net zero emissions goals.

>These tactics successfully blocked policy over the past 50 years that could have helped prevent climate catastrophes like Milton. Half of U.S. states, including Florida, recently passed laws prohibiting methane gas restrictions, even though it’s a highly-polluting fossil fuel. Fossil fuel lobbyists have also prevented a global resolution ending fossil fuel use, which experts say is necessary to preserve a livable climate.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Yeah, that's a take. 

It's 100% a business decision. These people run global companies in a world where most of the world is doing stuff about climate change - that'll require a global shift of business practices...but at least it's global. 

Well, if America goes and does something different, they're now running with two strategies. That's expensive - they don't want to do that; They want to know what business to build and how it'll operate. One business, one strategy. Especially when they know America will inevitably revert it's decision again. 

It's the same logic behind California making a law that's enforced across America. It's cheaper to make one product for America that conforms to California regulations than to make two different products for America, even if it's only required in California.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"You all will probably jump down my throat on this one, I rarely post and just lurk. 

Exxon, Shell, Chevron, and BP will all HATE this. They hate it for a completely different reason than you would expect. The Paris Climate Accords open the floodgates to oil and gas exploration and production in developing nations. Hence, non-developed countries do not have to meet the same timelines as developed nations. This led to massive investments by the major oil companies in foreign nations. They knew they had a green light to make as much money as possible. If Trump starts putting tariffs on their imports their profit margins will be hit hard. Also, this completely fucks over states like California. California is one of the largest markets for imported oil in the world. It has slowly been reducing the number of barrels it produces using regulation. Currently, CA imports 58% of its oil from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, and Ecuador.

"a lot of folks don't seem to realize that some refineries were shuttered during covid and never brought back online. starting up a refinery is not like turning on a light switch. older refineries require upgrades to be in compliance with environmental regulations, and it's really expensive to bring one back up even if it doesn't need upgrades. arguably trump will probably just scrap the entire EPA, but like i said, it's still really expensive even without upgrades. oil companies aren't going to spend the money to put the still-shuttered refineries back in service just to flood the market with refined product so cheap that they can't make a profit. they could build a million new pump jacks and that's not going to change refinery capacity. economics are more complex than trump and most of his idiot supporters understand. simply drilling more isn't going to bring the cost of gas down much when there's a lower limit on how cheap it can be before the oil companies are operating at a loss, even with other uses for petrol products (like plastics). they'd like to squeeze what money they still can out of us, but the oil companies see the writing on the wall. some have converted facilities to biofuel and diesel production.

and for all the whining about biden from the right, the biden admin approved more new drilling permits than the trump admin did, so if you want to complain about how biden is standing in the way of utilizing our natural resources, well...reality doesn't matter to the people who believe biden was stymieing drilling.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

Yeah, funny thing about all that stuff: it was largely vaporware.

There is limited support for funding from bank/capital side, because it’s just a bit of a tricky segment (unless you’re integrated like the likes of Shell, Exxon, etc…), and even people who like O&G prefer upstream (drilling) assets rather than midstream (refineries). 

To add why even players in the segment don’t like refineries that much, it’s to do with the mechanics of the financial aspect to it. With drilling, you just have to cover your drilling costs. With refineries, your crack spread (price of selling your refined product, minus the cost of buying your crude/feed) has to cover your fixed costs (which are high), and are incredibly volatile (it’s two moving parts vs drilling where it’s 1), and it can quite often get into negative territory. Plus it’s single, large assets, so like if there’s a fire or something or repair needs, you’ve idled a bunch of money for a good amount of days. It’s just a bit shit.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"If there is any evidence that Tulsi is a Russian asset, Biden needs to declassify that as of yesterday",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Oh, isn’t this just the world’s most predictable plot twist? Here we have Tulsi Gabbard—who’s spent the last few years being the “free thinker” parroting every Kremlin-approved line on Ukraine—getting a donation from an accused Russian agent, then spreading Russian disinformation, and somehow cozying up to Trump, who’s practically got Putin on speed dial. It's like watching someone audition for a role in “How to Become a Useful Idiot for Foreign Powers,” and wow, she's really nailing it.

Let’s go through the highlights here. First, we have accused Russian agent Elena Branson throwing cash at Gabbard’s campaign. Now, campaign donations are one thing, but when your donors start coming with KGB-flavored baggage, maybe it’s time to wonder if you’re on the wrong side of history. But Tulsi? She’s out here repeating Russian state talking points on biolabs in Ukraine, a conspiracy so flimsy even Fox News occasionally backs away. She’s got “independent thinker” written on her bio, but all that “independence” seems to lead right back to Moscow’s agenda. Funny how that works.

Then, we see her somehow on a short list for a top intelligence post in a hypothetical Trump administration. Yes, that Trump—the guy who openly believes Putin over his own intelligence agencies. And here she is, a former Army officer, supposedly trained to recognize threats to national security, bending over backward to parrot the same talking points that an authoritarian regime is feeding the world. If irony were a fuel source, we’d be set for a century.

Tulsi Gabbard’s transformation from “anti-war” candidate to the Kremlin’s go-to American mouthpiece is a case study in how not to serve your country. She’s out here claiming to fight the “establishment,” but what she’s really fighting for is the privilege to echo Russian propaganda under the guise of “asking questions.” And if that’s not enough, she’s a favorite of Trump’s far-right crowd, who’d happily replace democracy with an authoritarian state that crushes dissent.

So, there you have it: a candidate funded by a Russian agent, spreading Kremlin-approved disinformation, who’d love a cozy spot in an administration that treats foreign dictators like best pals. This isn't ""independent thinking""; it's a master class in shameless opportunism, with a side of authoritarian enabling. If you’re surprised, you haven’t been paying attention.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"Gabbard is a Russian asset. Has been for years. This was a long time coming. Putin read our country correctly. Half of the voting population are driven by mindless hate or a level of greed that sidelines any principles or ethics they may otherwise have. And an enormous percentage of our population who could've voted didn't because our political system has disenfranchised its citizens. When first-term senators can leave four years later with a net worth triple what it was when they were sworn it, let's not wonder why people don't think a vote is meaningful. 

It will take good Americans and patriotic state leaders to hold our ground. It was never about the price of eggs. It was definitely never about the price of gas for these people who buy two-ton pickup trucks that get eight miles a gallon. Weaponized hate is powerful. The phrase divide and conquer is apt. Left-leaning people talking about calling in ICE on their Trump-voting Latino neighbors are carrying Putin's water. The only thing we can do is resist and support the vanishingly small collection of politicians who will fight for us. 

By the way, gotta love all the Trumpets brigading Reddit subs since Trump won, braying about progressives ""overreacting"" to the implications of a Trump presidency.

It started when Reagan deregulated banks. Its administration greenlit the use of peoples money in their bank account and use it on the stock market. Its been downhill since to the point most banks are severly overleveraged on VISIBLE points of accounting. Imagine the crap stored in oversea swaps and derivatives.

It's been repeated several times since, including Trump's massive tax break during his last term and the next one he's promising. 

The wealth gap just continues going crazy. And now we are seeing active oligarchy activity, especially from some who have been rumored to have contact with Putin, who knows how to build a dictatorship.

Remember when all the politicans in southern states were talking about separating from the USA and I said just let them go, they are useless, all on welfare, worthless to america, let them go, who cares? You downvoted me.   


When I suggested that we issue literacy tests to people to make sure they are competent before we allow them to vote? You downvoted me.   


When I suggested that, in republican areas, we move polling stations far away from population centers so it's harder and more of a hassle for them to vote? You downvoted me.  


When I suggested that in reality democrats are in a cold civil war with Republicans and we should make it hard for Republicans, by whatever means possible, to vote? You downvoted me.  


When i suggested, after trump won, that Biden use his new found king powers and drone strike republican states? You downvoted me.

For the rest of us, it was Army Commendation Medals, or Army Achievement Medals for some E4 and below folks whose leadership apparently hated them.

"Getting rid of all of that institutional knowledge is going to absolutely grind the military to a halt. There is no way there are enough maga loyalists who are also competent commanders to fill those gaps. Especially since the US militaries main strength lies in its overwhelming logistical superiority, no small feat btw. 


Stalin tried something similar and it almost cost him WWII. It most certainly cost the Soviet's millions of unnecessary deaths and territorial loses early in the war because they were unprepared and had a decimated officer corps. All those stories about incompetent officers throwing their soldiers into meat wave attacks without a weapon, yeah that's what was happening there. It is arguable that without the US Lend Lease program that the USSR wouldn't have survived the initial onslaught. Playing what if with history is pointless but one has to wonder what horrors could have been avoided if the Soviet military hadn't been gutted by Stalin's paranoia.

"Oh, isn’t this just the world’s most predictable plot twist? Here we have Tulsi Gabbard—who’s spent the last few years being the “free thinker” parroting every Kremlin-approved line on Ukraine—getting a donation from an accused Russian agent, then spreading Russian disinformation, and somehow cozying up to Trump, who’s practically got Putin on speed dial. It's like watching someone audition for a role in “How to Become a Useful Idiot for Foreign Powers,” and wow, she's really nailing it.

Let’s go through the highlights here. First, we have accused Russian agent Elena Branson throwing cash at Gabbard’s campaign. Now, campaign donations are one thing, but when your donors start coming with KGB-flavored baggage, maybe it’s time to wonder if you’re on the wrong side of history. But Tulsi? She’s out here repeating Russian state talking points on biolabs in Ukraine, a conspiracy so flimsy even Fox News occasionally backs away. She’s got “independent thinker” written on her bio, but all that “independence” seems to lead right back to Moscow’s agenda. Funny how that works.

Then, we see her somehow on a short list for a top intelligence post in a hypothetical Trump administration. Yes, that Trump—the guy who openly believes Putin over his own intelligence agencies. And here she is, a former Army officer, supposedly trained to recognize threats to national security, bending over backward to parrot the same talking points that an authoritarian regime is feeding the world. If irony were a fuel source, we’d be set for a century.

Tulsi Gabbard’s transformation from “anti-war” candidate to the Kremlin’s go-to American mouthpiece is a case study in how not to serve your country. She’s out here claiming to fight the “establishment,” but what she’s really fighting for is the privilege to echo Russian propaganda under the guise of “asking questions.” And if that’s not enough, she’s a favorite of Trump’s far-right crowd, who’d happily replace democracy with an authoritarian state that crushes dissent.

So, there you have it: a candidate funded by a Russian agent, spreading Kremlin-approved disinformation, who’d love a cozy spot in an administration that treats foreign dictators like best pals. This isn't ""independent thinking""; it's a master class in shameless opportunism, with a side of authoritarian enabling. If you’re surprised, you haven’t been paying attention.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"The ""Red Scare people"" used the imaginary threat of communism as an excuse to push out basically every progressive politician that had anything to do with the New Deal (which basically built the entire foundation of our modern world). Why? Because fascism is preferable to paying taxes according to the most powerful and influential people in this country. 

It's why the OSS overthrew Italy's first democratic election post WW2 and why after they later became the CIA they spent the next few decades overthrowing democratically elected socialists in South America and replacing them with literal fascist dictators. Brown Hitler is preferable to nepo babies paying taxes. That's the line America drew in the sand 80ish years ago. 

The problem with that idea is that nepo babies are most often narcissistic sociopaths who think they're special little snowflakes that are immune to the ills that plague literally the entirety of recorded human history.

I have to read about this.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I’m not sure if you’ve read or heard about the book Foundations of Geopolitics by Aleksandr Dugin, but it’s basically a political playbook written in the 90s of what and how Russia should do in all parts of the world in order to gain power. Here’s a synopsis for the West - Americas:

Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States and Canada to fuel instability and separatism against neoliberal globalist Western hegemony, such as, for instance, provoke “Afro-American racists” to create severe backlash against the rotten political state of affairs in the current present-day system of the United States and Canada. Russia should “introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social, and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.

Dugin is a far right political philosopher in Russia and apparently Putin utilizes a lot of what is in that book.

Link for anyone interested in reading about the book and its contents.

Edit 2: Thank you for the awards. I believe this should be more widespread and not looked at as a crazy conspiracy theory. There are concepts written in there that have been, and are actively, being used around the globe. If it isn’t farfetched to believe genders are being changed in schools, people are eating others pets, etc, this shouldn’t be any less believable. Good luck to us all.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"They don’t want America to be Russia, because that version would probably aggressively box with them. What they want is a submissive state that sanctions itself through global tariffs and withdraws from nato and the rest of the world while being frozen from making any type of internal decision due gridlock and strife. Aka everything trump wants.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Reminds me of a video I saw Extra History do on British conquest of India.


I went into the video with the assumption that at this point the British had the superior military and technology. Apparently they didn't and were the underdogs by far. The way they did it was by putting each local leader against each other. Weaken them, oh and it was the British east india company that paved the way, not the government. They came in later, meaning it was a single company that paved the way due to greed.


It was a while ago, but it stuck with me. How an inferior power (at the time) just dismantled a greater power from the inside.


I think the US fails in teaching history. At least personally, the Gallic wars weren't taught in the classrooms either.


Nor how the Spaniards pitted indigenous tribes against each other in the Americas.


This strategy of using local groups with past feuds to fight against each other before the outside power conquers them all is all over history. Yet afaik it's not taught much at all in the US.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

Yeah, the weak minded on the extreme side of each party are done for, but those of us willing to work with each other might have the free will still to reject what’s coming.

Contrary to the projection by conservatives that the media is liberally biased, the corporate for-profit news outlets are really just center-right; which means the overton window goes from center-right, to extreme-right but is cast off as center-right.

There's a reason this election fell along education attainment perhaps more than any other single factor. College educated people could see it; low-info non-college educated people were duped. Not just MAGA, but those apathetic moderates who sat home, as well as the uncommitted movement, too.

"We did swing for the fences which is WHY we got the ACA. 

These things are months long processes. It doesn’t happen overnight. There’s a lot of wheeling and dealing, and changing things, and fine tuning things until we can come to an agreement. 

(Edit/added Obama’s term started in Jan 2009. ACA didn’t pass until March 2010. These things don’t happen overnight!)

Which is why it got watered down despite being a Republican policy before Obama adopted it. 

Too many people seem to think Government moves faster than it does. We only had the majority for a short time. 

And once again we got things passed on a bipartisan effort. 

Had they wasted time trying to kill the filibuster which Manchin and Sinema declared they will never do or packing the Supreme Court which McConnell PROVED he wouldn’t allow, nothing would have been accomplished. 

But somehow that miraculous thing is suggested that we didn’t do enough.

Edit: added link - this is a great interview explaining what we had before and why it was terrible and then trying to explain how hard it is to wrangle cats into one room to work together. 

You can start here (1/2 way down the page for the HOW):

presidential leadership is absolutely critical. You have to have a president who says, “I’m going to make this my priority. This is the number one thing for my administration. This is the domestic policy that I’m going to take on and try to fix.” And you had that in President Obama. He took up health care reform. I’m sure there were probably a lot of advisors who said, “This is a hornet’s nest. Maybe you ought to go in a different direction,” but President Obama took this up and said, “This is something I want to get done.” And it’s hard to understate how critical that that leadership is. I’d say his leadership was important, not just because he made it a priority, but also because he helped sort through some of the controversies and some of the policy issues that might’ve tripped us up working on legislation and trying to get that through.
So the president’s role, not only in setting the policy direction and setting the policy priorities, but also helping to help Congress sort through some of the controversial issues when there’s disagreements. Making sure that members stayed on board and everyone’s oars were in the boat rowing in the same direction. I know that’s not a great phrase, but . . .

"The history of democracies that have backslid into autocracy in the past 25 years can give us a pretty sold playbook of what to expect:

1. Media Control is usually first - this shapes public perception of all subsequent moves and limits organized opposition. The playbook often starts with claims of ""fake news"" or ""foreign influence"" to justify media restrictions.
2. Security Services Restructuring tends to follow quickly - ensuring control of coercive power while resistance potential is highest. This often happens quietly through personnel changes and ""reorganization"" rather than dramatic purges.
3. Electoral System Changes usually come third - modifying rules before the next election cycle while public attention is focused on more visible changes.
4. Judicial System Manipulation typically follows - once electoral changes are secure, courts are reformed to prevent legal challenges.
5. Administrative State Capture comes next - replacing career bureaucrats with loyalists to ensure policy implementation.
6. Legislative Power Concentration follows - often through ""emergency measures"" or ""government efficiency"" reforms.
7. Economic Control tends to come after core power is secured - targeting business elites who might fund opposition.
8. Civil Society Restrictions ramp up gradually - usually framed around ""foreign interference"" concerns.
9. Information Control Systems expand incrementally - building on initial media controls.
10. Educational System Control usually comes last - a long-term project to reshape societal values.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"To everyone: apathy elected Trump. Apathy will continue to secure his power. We need to make the GOP uneasy as possible. We need to be loud and disobedient. Your life is on the line either way. You can stand with protestors and, with enough numbers, protect them, or you can get whittled down, picked off, and marginalized by an authoritarian government that will never be satisfied. 

If it is hard and bloody to impose authoritarianism in its early stages, when there is still free press, then it will not take hold. Politicians will defect. Corporations will distance. A significant slice of apathetic people will activate — for example, the many Gen Z non voters who showed up for George Floyd or Palestine protests.

The world feels bleak. That means it’s time to be a hero. And encourage the people next to you to find it in themselves as well.

"Well the stock market is not the economy. If there is one trend I am confident won’t change it is the increasing price of assets. Stocks and real estate will continue to rise. While Trumps policies like  tariffs will cause inflation if implemented. Increasing the costs for working Americans and at the same time the price of real estate rising will continue to squeeze the middle class. The other thing that’s concerning is what happens if they cut the 2 trillion from the federal budget that Musk was talking about. The far reaching effects in the economy are hard to predict but most likely they will cut welfare programs like social security, Medicaid and Medicare. That’s essentially the only way to cut that large part of the budget. Remember the deficit is 1.7 trillion. The whole budget is 6.2 trillion. This is gonna cause deflationary pressure in the economy. Then the Fed is going to have to lower the interest rate to stay at 2% inflation. Lower interest rate means again assets are going to rocket in value. The increase in asset prices will also be boosted by the Tax cuts that Trump wants to implement. When very wealthy people have more money they buy assets. So cutting their taxes boosts the value of assets even more. We have already seen blackrock rolling around the neighbourhoods buying up housing just because there are to few good investment opportunities. Just based on what Trump has said he wants to help make the wealthy more wealthy and the cost is going to be carried by the working Americans.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

The other thing - as with the entire Trump campaign - is that they promise contradictory things to different people. The people who he told that to are the people who want the whole system to burn so they can rebuild a brave new world (the same sort of thing right-wing nut and not-as-smart-as-he-wants-to-be political adviser Dominic Cummings did in the UK under Boris Johnson - say that the system was the problem to get the anti-establishment types on board, and that he needed to take over the system to rebuild it in his image).

"It shares aspects in common with cults but the quote more directly references revolutionary ideologies. Which for my money is the better parallel - things like the French and Russian revolutions.

Both exhibited fairly grim behaviours after they gained control when reality stubbornly failed to match up the promises the ideology made and their simple solutions to complex problems actually made things worse. 

Hunting for scapegoats is one. Sometimes the poor unfortunates who failed to make unrealistic things magically happen - but more often simply any handy nearby groups who were already disliked by the mob, be they aristocrats, bourgeoise or Kulaks. Which served as both a useful distraction for the mob and a way to divert anger away from political leaders. 

Another was a gradual bifurcation between reality and political reality. Inconvenient facts and numbers stop being reported - or get ‘corrected’ before being fed up the hierarchy. Eventually the government is happily playing about in a fantasy world blissfully unaware that in the real world the wheels are really coming off. 

Sad to say I think there’s scope for modern parallels to both to happen in the U.S. It’s not like MAGA types are short of groups they already despise - starting with immigrants but also including pretty much every religious and racial minority, atheists, college educated people … etc. And during the pandemic we saw just how readily even a modern audience accepts things like “not counting the numbers so the problem goes away”.

"While everything you said is true, it really is as simple as ""I'm struggling, it's the party in power's fault."" It's why we go through this doom cycle *every* 8 years. Bush inherited a booming economy from Clinton who left office with a surplus. Bush tanked it, Obama cleaned it up. Trump demolished it, Biden managed to keep us out of a recession despite really unprecedented circumstances, but again, it takes *time* for it to be felt by the average American. No one cares about objective facts like GDP, unemployment, low inflation *now.* Trump is inheriting a strongly recovering economy, and just like Trump's first presidency, people are like gold fish.

You vastly underestimate how disconnected people are from politics, the amount of people who *still* think Trump is some wizard businessman while ignoring *everything* else.

What's disturbing to me is that people would rather elect an adjudicated rapist and convicted felon who tried to overthrow democracy, stole national secrets because they want cheaper eggs. That one to me is more disturbing. This wasn't like 2016 when people didn't *know* how bad Trump would be.

"Yes, this is all absurd and dangerous.  No, no one is specifically to blame for the dangers we face.

However, it has been beyond obvious to all of us that the people of our nation did not want to continue to fund this massive defense budget. 

trump and his people are not the answer, since their version of cutting costs is to surrender our values and allies to people that are our enemies.  However, this is yet another example of the Democrats taking the voters for granted for decades and decades - we wanted change, they refused, and now we all get the kind of change that we really, truly do not want or need.

The base of the party, the overwhelming mass of Democrats and anti-conservatives like me (I left the party decades ago and they have done nothing to win me back), wants to change basically all of the things that maga also wants to change.  Unfortunately for us, the change we want is exactly the opposite of the change that trump will bring, and those of us who voted for him or against Biden are going to realize soon how much of a mistake we made.

However, we have asked for change from the Democrats for decades to fix the military budget, health care, education, employment and income inequality, housing, and basically every facet of our lives.  We have not been heard, and we have been taken for granted.  A large part of the blame for the tragedy and suffering that trump is going to inflict on our nation lies at the feet of the corporatist Democrats who thought they could share power and wealth with the right and tune us out.  

We cannot go back to the same two party system that has failed us.  We need a radially reformed left wing party that will no longer merely serve as the lesser of two evils.  We cannot combat this alt right extremism with more milquetoast middle of the road policies.

It is time for Democrats to tell lower middle class voters that they are pawns in the grand game of the American economy.  It is time to show them that trump is merely more of the boot that has kept them down for a very long time, and it is time for the Democrats to truly support the working class.  

It is amazing that the messaging of the party is so weak that the voters who need them the most voted for the lies of the party that wants to fleece them the most.  Democrats are profoundly pathetic and any Democrat who wants change must demand a full-scale change in party leadership.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"Just my experience from being in the service when these initiatives were started. In the Marines, they tried holding women to the higher male physical fitness standards. They gave women 2 years to prepare for the new test and by the time we got to the deadline something like 95% of women couldn't pass the bare minimum and none could get a ""good"" score. They couldn't move forward with a standard that would kick out the majority of women so they tried just having women do a max of 8 pullups(men's max is 20) and women's scores on that would still be too low(meaning over time they would get promoted less in the aggregate) so it was scrapped entirely and women remained on thier old lower test standard.

">Yeah and now the goalposts are shifting. You don’t need to attend Ranger school to be a good Infantry leader and you don’t need to attend Ranger school to be a Secretary of Defense.

Oh please. Tab game is stupid, but every Tom, Dick, and Harry knows that earning a tab is a career must for an infantry officer - and not checking it says a lot about the quality of the officer.

And comparing him to Hagel or Panetta is apples and oranges - both of them had qualified on their relevant government experience, not their military experience. 

Hell, Hagel resigned as a Deputy Admin of the VA in his early federal career in protest of the Admin's comments on veterans groups and downplaying Agent Orange. Meanwhile Hegseth is out their saying vets are abusing the system and lack integrity for filing claims because vet grouos are greedy.

In non combat arms role, this doesn't matter because women are just as good at being in supply, being jet engine mechanics, operating radars, etc. But it matters a lot when one person on your team can't carry as much ammo and gear on patrol because thier body is physically too weak and even if they muscle through it they will end up disabled in a few short years. 

We are so focused on the philosophy of equality that we aren't able to have sensible conversations about reality.

Democrats have a decades long history of doing exactly this. Reagan's bones should still behind bars, as well as Nixon's. The Democrats don't care about the people of this country, and Republicans are the physical embodiment of evil.

That's not how politics works at all bro. This shit isn't a fucking team sport. If you fail voters and the other party fails voters, they check out or find someone to vote for. You can't do nothing and expect people to come crawling back to what they walked away from. You have to give them something to walk towards.

Democrats have always believed entitled to every single vote ever because they just FEEL they are morally superior. It's voters who should just know they're the best, the greatest, the most loyalist ever... and just because people are a Democrat, they are magically equally awesome, so just vote for whomever they tell you to regardless of your feelings, because fuck what you want, we want this.

Meanwhile Republicans are bending themselves into the most ridiculously obviously bullshit lies to please their voter base. Republicans control all branches of the government... gee... wonder what is so different about the parties... Yeah, definitely not the same thing at all. Republicans understand they are beholden to the voters, not entitled to them. It's so fucking revolting that spineless shitbags like Cruz and Trump fucking get it, but the entire Democratic Party is just going, ""huh? What are you talking about?

"Boring history lesson. 

There were three pillars of the ACA originally. The mandate, the subsidies, and the protections. You need all three to have a functioning system at an affordable cost. The mandate got killed. We have been living with a somewhat maimed ACA since then that is better than the prior system, but has the weakness of being exposed to a “death spiral” if subsidies are not sufficient to keep the risk pool large enough. 

If the subsidies are removed then a blue state trying to enforce the protections alone is not going to be able to maintain a healthy system. 

Here is how those protections worked in blue states before the ACA. The protections raise the cost of insurance, which means less people buy insurance each year. The people leaving are the healthy ones. The remaining people are those that need the protections and have high medical expenses. This makes costs increase even more, causing fewer healthy people to buy insurance next year. This is the death spiral. That is why more states didn’t do it themselves. They would need to recreate the subsidies and/or mandate to do it properly, and it is much harder for a single state to manage that.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"> Democrats are frequently the party of status quo.

That's because since 2010 the Democrats have included any politician that wanted to act in good faith. That means the conservatives and the liberal and the progressives. So expanding beyond the status quo was impossible since the conservatives would never go along with it. One of the biggest success of Biden's presidency was forcing those conservatives and liberals to compromise with the progressives, the Inflation Reduction Act was a compromise that the progressives won. Fuck, Biden ended the drone war, something progressives have been demanding for decades, but he got zero credit for it.


And the Democratic majorities *never* had the votes to codify Roe. It would have cost them otherwise ""safe"" seats and wasn't necessary, because every justice said that they would respect it. Even in 2021 and 2022 there was no way that Sinema or Manchin would have gone along with it.

"> If instead there's a federal law saying ""states are banned from providing free cookies"" then you're getting nothing.

Not quite. The only real power the federal government has in cases like this is withholding funding that the state relies on. For instance drinking age minimums are tied to highway budget for states. So if you lower your drinking age you lose out on billions of dollars. But for other things that are federally illegal like marijuana there is no federal promises tied to it so states can just ignore it. So if the Fed said ""You can't give out free cookies anymore"" but didn't tie any money to it, then the states could just ignore it. So basically the Fed would need to both pass the law that says ""you can't give healthcare out"" and then also tie to a rule of  ""If you do you lose federal funding for something"". In which case States could still mandate healthcare coverage at the state level, unless they could get all the states to agree to tie healthcare coverage restrictions to some funding, which is a tougher sell, because in red states it is unpopular to give power to the fed while in blue states it would be unpopular to ban healthcare.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"Maine Sen. Susan Collins told media outlets Wednesday she was “shocked” by President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to become attorney general.

Collins, a member of the Senate’s new Republican majority, described her surprise at the decision in comments to reporters in the hallway outside the Senate chambers Wednesday.

“I was shocked by the announcement. This shows why the advice and consent process is so important, and I’m sure that there will be a lot of questions raised at his hearing,” she said. “Obviously, the president has the right to nominate whomever he wishes, but I’m certain that there will be a lot of questions.”

She was quoted in the New York Times, among other publications.

Collins also cast doubt on Gaetz’s ability to achieve Senate confirmation, according to reporting from WBUR.

“I’m sure that there will be many, many questions raised at Mr. Gaetz’s hearing, if in fact the nomination goes forward,” she said.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

You did this Susan,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Fuck her. She’ll say / act like that’s the case and then still be on board with it by the end. 

If she (and others) were really concerned they would have done more to try and help NOT get Trump reelected. Don’t fall for it.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Well she has visible parkinsons and should fuck off from politics.,2024_11_14,05_43_09

"Back to this, I see. Sigh.....",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Mild hand-wringing to follow.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Just wait! There’s more!,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Don’t worry, she will fall in line",2024_11_14,05_43_09
What’s the saying about an orange faced clown eating your face? I forget.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
I hope there is a special place in hell for Susan Collins.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Is ""SHOCKED"" the only word in her vocab?",2024_11_14,05_43_09
She always seems to shocked. Shocker…..,2024_11_14,05_43_09
4 more years of Susan Collins being shocked but doing nothing about it.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Um, can I have the job of sitting next to Susan Collins for the next four years and every time she is concerned, I get to yell ""shut the fuck up!""",2024_11_14,05_43_09
I'm sure the shock will wear off with the next donor check.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I was her constituent at that time, I wrote so many emails and left so many messages. It fell on deaf ears, she is such a performative jerk.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Exactly, she will ""ask"" questions and approve him anyway.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"She acts like someone who can't feel emotions so she has some generic ""AI"" generate her feelings for her. She never acts on these generated emotions, but by golly if they haven't almost appeared authentic from time to time. Not anymore though",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Susan Collins to Matt Gaetz- “Besides Florida’s age of consent- what’s your favorite law?”,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Kavanaugh is infinitely more qualified for SCOTUS than Gaetz is for AG.

This one is going to earn some actual scrutiny from GOP Senators, who frankly hate Gaetz. Will that sink the confirmation? I honestly don’t know. But this one is worth watching.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
She’s dumb. I’ll never forget her saying she thought Trump learned his lesson. What a bitch.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Strict hand wringing, coming right up.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Yeah they are go along with everything Trump wants, but Susan Collins will at times make a surprised Pikachu face",2024_11_14,05_43_09
They ain’t shocked. If they’re shocked they’re idiots. They’re not shocked.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
But she was so sure he'd learned his lesson.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Like.... seriously... does she have daily amnesia or something? Is she just incredibly dense? Is she trolling everyone? Wtf.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"If it comes down to her to confirm him. . .  We’re in for another self righteous speech about “innocent until proven guilty” and “he **said** that Roe v Wade was settled law”!

Blah, blah, blah . . . Save it.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Somehow she exemplifies every idiot older adult in every Stephen King novel who doesn't listen until it's too late,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"If they don’t bypass the nominations, I’m sure there will be questions asked. And responded to with BS answers. And then all of it will be ignored and he’ll he ushered through anyway. 

“Questions” never seemed to stop all of the unqualified judges Trump kept pushing through.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
I wish she was my grandma. I could keep fucking up and I'd keep getting that $20 birthday card every year.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Susan, there are not going to be hearings. Trump is going to recess appoint his cabinet. He said so and you will not stop him.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Not sure the president or Matt Gaetz cares about the consent process.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
">“Obviously, the president has the right to nominate whomever he wishes, but I’m certain that there will be a lot of questions.”

And in case anyone missed it, I can translate.

They're just going to pick a few among themselves to act concerned and ask ""questions"" but it won't come to anything and they'll just ok the guy *or* shrug and say ""we tried what can you do"" when their protests are ignored.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"""I'm certain he'll learn from this nomination""",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Yes questions like, why did you pay for underage sex",2024_11_14,05_43_09
There is no hearing coming. They are all getting recess appointments,2024_11_14,05_43_09
She might genuinely have some sort of brain trauma or ailment at this point.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
She can just copy and paste this a lot moving forward.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
She's a shitty judge of character.  Or she's full of shit.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"She's assuming he HAS a hearing.   
These people are just willfully stupid at this point.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Oh no! Questions?!?!?!,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Oh the questions! Thank God for the questions. Eye roll.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Sounds like Susan knows whether she’ll vote to confirm him or not. 

I doubt we’ll like that outcome, given her history.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
I wipe my ass with Susan Collins’ questions. Lol,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Mainers could have had Sara Gideon and chose this dipshit.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Shelll be gladly voting yes in two months too,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Just questions but then APPROVED!,2024_11_14,05_43_09
She’s been shocked for the last 30 years.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"She’s shocked like she always is, but she’ll get in line to boot lick and vote yes like she always does.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I mentally picture her clutching her pearls every time I read her name.  She has perfected the ability of feigning concern and saying something completely meaningless like ""I was shocked"" and ""there will be a lot of questions."" No shit, Susan ya fuckin dope.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Hey you know who could have done something about this? 😬,2024_11_14,05_43_09
I'm sure he's learnt his lesson. This time.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Shocked, but I’m sure he’s learned his lesson this time",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Welcome to our nightmare Senetor Collins! What did you think would happen since you did not do your job protecting the American people.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
She will do whatever Trump tells her to do. She was born without a spine.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Oh, shit. Are we already starting with Susan’s feigned outrage over Trump’s actions again? Didn’t figure that would start until January. And, like last time, I’m sure we can still expect her to vote “yes” to whatever he asks for unless she knows her vote won’t matter.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"There might be questions, but he'll still be the AG.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Susan, keep that head where it's nice and warm.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
But is she concerned though? That is the question.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Can’t wait for “….but we confirmed his appointment anyway.”,2024_11_14,05_43_09
lol. Hearing. She’s so funny. ,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"She'll be all 'shocked,' she'll act 'perplexed,' and then she'll vote to confirm him. Fuck Susan Collins.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Honestly, I'm just not going to spend the next 4 Year's thinking she's going to to anything more useful then a ""concerning.😳"" Quote. ",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Shows 'concern', still votes to confirm nomination. Classic Susan.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
I'd like her to change.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Never even thought of the confirmation hearing. Dems have nothing to lose and everything to gain by going absolutely scorched earth on him,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Wow, she seems so sincere. 🤔",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Brow furrowed, moving on

Susan you dumb fucking asshole. You helped make all of this possible. If you have anything resembling shame, start voting with dems.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
But she is sure he will learn his lesson.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Her brow slightly furrowed.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I am sure she will:

1. Do nothing
2. Express concern
3. Do nothing",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Sadly, like every other spineless Republican, I'm assuming she'll just fall in line.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"She's up for re-election in two years, time to make a mad dash to the center! Hopefully Maine voters will finally send this MAGA hag packing.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
She has asked her aides to fetch the smelling salts and a handkerchief,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Evidently not concerned enough.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Well, they run into each other often at the parties.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Pedophiles of a Feather, Flock Together",2024_11_14,05_43_09
That's why Elon Musk has attacked himself so hard to Trump. He needs protection.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Any time she says she’s shocked, you could replace it with “not surprised”.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
She’ll still vote yes next year for him.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Wait until you find out who he's nominating for DNI,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Diddy is getting off,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Don't forget to rage against the democrats over it.  Maga are just simple folk who are hurting and couldn't help themselves.  Lulz.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Yup, Republicans will always fall in line.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Democrats have to fall in love but republicans just have to fall in line.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
If the next 4 years are more destructive than the fucking civil war we are in for a really bad time.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Lol. You act like this country will last another 4 years,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"At his hearing?

Trump will give him a recess appointment so no need for hearings.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"If any of these Republican politicians had anything resembling a moral principle, we wouldn’t be at this point",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Lol, she's not dumb.  She knows her voters are.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I'll never understand. They're 71 and 67 years old. What in the world do they have to risk? You'd think if anyone were in a position to make a moral stand, it would be them.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
The Onion put out of business overnight by reality,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Concerned, I’m sure",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Yet she was reelected in 2020 by the voters of Maine, and she has been in the Senate since 1997.

No wonder Congress doesn't want term limits.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Maybe she learned her lesson and just felt too guilty to respond.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
She’s either the biggest faker or the most gullible person in the building.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"“Matt are you a pedophile?”  
  
“No comment”  
  
“I believe him.”",2024_11_14,05_43_09
You assume there will be a vetting process at all.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Well Lisa Murkowski in all her regained relevance came out and said that surely it’s not serious, and she looks forward to confirming a serious candidate. 

I really hope she’s as “independently” minded as she said she was instead of just trading with Collins on who gets to be the no vote and act like they have some moral high ground.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
 I hope to God you're right.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
You're right; Kavanaugh received top marks from the Bar Association.  His *personal* conduct was the issue. Gaetz is unqualified.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"It probably won’t matter. They could lose Collins, Merkowski and McConnell and still push it over the finish line…",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"This was exactly my thought. They can't reject many of his outrageous choices but they'd probably do well to shoot down one and this would be the obvious choice. 


Of course that could be the plan so he can then install someone equally odious once they've run out of backbone",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Imagine the catastrophic failure of judgment it would require to really believe Donald Trump learned his lesson after receiving no punishment. Luckily she's just a liar instead, thank goodness.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
No she's just a liar. She votes the party line every time her vote matters. When it doesn't she casts meaningless protest votes to make her appear more moderate to her constituents. She knows exactly what she's doing.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
the thing is MAGA has been straight up hallucinating about this alternate version of trump that will actually help people for 11 years at this point even though he failed at the one job he was supposed to do the first time,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Who cares anymore? We always worry about these losers but all they do is spread a cancer in society that has led to a second Trump term. At some point a virus is a virus,2024_11_14,05_43_09
She doesn’t. She just thinks the rest of us do.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Good thing the people of Maine decided not to reelect her in 2022


Oh wait, they did",2024_11_14,05_43_09
I've never forgotten that speech. That was such a horrible stunt and I won't be forgiving her for it.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Except for the 'not getting killed' thing,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"A comparison that is almost certainly not lost on King. Opinions about his stories aside, he IS very good at creating realistic character and absolutely knows exactly what kind of person she is.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I have a small amount of hope that if his recommendations are crazy enough, the Senate will remember he’s term limited and can’t hurt them as much as he could have in the past if they try to hold him to a modicum of normalcy. It is, admittedly, not very likely",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"This time, for sure!",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Temba, her arms wide.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

They fucking better this time.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I don't think of her as a MAGA hag, I think of her as a MAGA *enabling* hag.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
When remember when she ran as pro term limits... 5 terms ago.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Just like Lindsey Graham,2024_11_14,05_43_09
You mean the ones over at Diddy's house? Or the Epstein Island ones? I'm a little confused.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Ukraine is fucked. Now I’m crying and feel like throwing up.,2024_11_14,05_43_09

> Musk later insisted his agency’s “actions will be posted online for maximum transparency,” and will update a leaderboard for the “most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars.”

> Only Congress has the power to create federal agencies, although a Republican-controlled Senate and House could theoretically pass a bill establishing the office.

> Trump could also appoint the duo under the Federal Advisory Committees Act, which allows the government to set up groups to provide “expert advice, ideas, and diverse opinions to the Federal Government.”

> This would potentially allow Musk and Ramaswamy to remain advisers instead of federal employees—meaning they would not necessarily be legally required to disclose conflicts of interest like employees of agencies such as the Department of Justice or the Defense Department.”

One could argue that Republicans also created an entire branch of the military- Space Force.   But even that's conceptually similar to Truman splitting the USAF off from the US Army Air Force.  In each case, the parent branch was already doing the job, it just gives subject matter experts a place in high level discussions.  In Truman's time, it was clear that bombers could decide the fate of the world, but the Army was always going to be commanded by generals primarily concerned with ground troops.   The USAF and the other branches were all doing military satellites, but they are a categorically different domain of operations so it made sense to assign them to an independent command.

I believe in efficient, minimal government, but I don’t think Christian values should dictate the moral governing of our country. I’m a Christian as well. Bible study should not be part of public education. 

Tariffs are an extremely powerful force. We do need strong pro-American policies though. I think a 20% tariff on many imports can be useful, but it should be rolled out slowly. Increasing to 20% over 10 years would give American companies time to build the infrastructure needed to avoid rapid increases in prices for Americans.

"Republicans can trot out the 'woke' bullshit all they want, but they're the ones pushing the culture war, certainly by spending 300 million on anti-trans ads this election. 41% of Trump's ad expenditure in Oct (~36 million) was spent on such ads. There are less than *100* trans student athletes across the entire US. Only 2 federal inmates have been given gender affirming surgeries (and only because it's part of the law that healthcare be provided to them, the same law Trump upheld no less) at a total cost of <$50,000. So when there's hundreds of millions spent on those things? Let's stop pretending that it's not all borne out of Republicans simply hating trans people.

Meanwhile, we're seeing is an avalanche of anti-trans ads the past few years (>600 in 2024 alone), and these laws have resulted in suicide attempts by transgender and gender nonconforming teenagers increase by as much as 72%. Total silence from them when children are dying needlessly.

But the economy! But what about the children! What a farce. Because the reality is that trans people are not hurting anyone. Neither are immigrants causing the issues in the US. The real issue comes from wealth inequality via the rich refusing to pay their fair share. Turns out it's so easy to get people to vote against their interests by convincing them to hate and/or fear another group. What a sad state of affairs.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"I've been trans for 13+ years now, and I was a teenager in a rural area when the bathroom bills were gaining traction in the mid 2010s. 

I remember parents threatening to put bible verses on my school's doors when word got out that there was a trans kid. I remember having to provide testimony for the Grimm court case because I wasn't allowed to use the same bathrooms as my peers, and I was having to go entire school days with no bathroom breaks. I remember having teachers openly laugh in my face when I asked them to use my preferred name - and they did this in front of my classmates. When I came out at school, the first thing they did was call my parents and out me. I suffered horribly at home and at school until I graduated and left at 18. 

My senior year, we had a school shooting threat from a kid who frequently made instagram posts publicly mocking me and a couple of our LGBT classmates. While we sat in lockdown, someone directly joked that I was probably ""a prime target"" for the kid who made the threat. 

Do you know what going through that kind of thing fucking does to you? To your ability to trust others? Do you think someone would go through this frivolously? Does that seem like something ANYONE would put themselves through, if repressing transness worked? 

I implore anyone reading this to imagine how fucking exhausting it is to be trans and trying to mind your business right now. Like, fuck, we're literally just people. 

I wake up, go to my job, come home, make dinner, and spend time with my loved ones. Republicans act like we're some kind of hypothetical animal that spends 24/7 foaming at the mouth inflicting anarchy on the streets. Jesus Christ. It feels like a never ending uphill battle when people will still happily bring up insanely spun bullshit, like the school litter box story. 

I frankly don't know how to cope with the fact that so many people see cutting support for us as an acceptable loss - both liberals and conservatives. I'm tired of people throwing us under the bus because they dont think there are enough of us to matter (but also, inversely, that there are simultaneously too many of us?). 

 I mistakenly assumed the social attitude towards this would get better as I got older. My own parents stopped financially supporting me at 18 because I was trans. I lived in dogshit poverty for years while I tried to get back on my feet. I went to college to teach, worked my ass off to achieve my dream, and then ended up having to leave the career for my mental wellbeing after a kid physically threatened me and multiple parents complained about me after I was outed (against my will! I didn't even want to be out!). 

I am so, so, SO tired of feeling like everything I do just results in having the floor pulled out from under me if I happen to unluckily encounter someone with power over me who hates trans people. I hate having to accept shittier living conditions and shittier jobs just to avoid being in spaces that are openly hostile to my existence. 

And half of the public's knowledge on trans people comes from wildly exaggerated scenarios milked by rightwing media to get views and spark outrage. It feels like talking to a brick wall when I try to correct a non-trans person on some wild misunderstanding involving transition. 

I am so motherfucking tired. I feel horrible for trans kids right now. I've been through absolute Hell over this, and it still somehow seems to be getting worse. I don't know how I would've survived this same social climate if I were still a teenager. It's bleak. I'm sorry this is long... just... please see us as people. That's all I ask. I don't give a shit how woke or informed you are, just please ask yourself ""is it objectively cruel to say this about another human being"" when you speak of us. Anything. I'm so tired.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"By all accounts those anti-trans ads were the top performing Republican ads, which is why they ran them so much. They've found their #1 winning issue, and it isn't inflation or gun control or abortion. In a sad way its sort of ideal for them, because trans people are such a minority that most people don't know any openly transgender people, so Republicans can demonize them without the reality check that comes when people interact with members of a demonized minority and realize they aren't monsters. And the more they demonize them, the more people stay in the closet/never transition out of fear, which just makes those who do even more of an isolated minority.

Trans kids are doubly vulnerable, because they can't vote and a lot of parents would prefer their kids not be trans, so if you go after trans kids the kids themselves can't vote against you and a decent chunk of their parents will be looking for ""solutions"" to make their kids not be trans.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"I know I'll get down votes here, but what the heck. I think the dems pushed the trans rights issue too far. There was a lot of questions and a lot of misinformation. 
Gender affirming care - are there states that are allowing medical care to minors? If so, that's nuts. Prisoners and Service members should not be entitled to gender affirming care on the taxpayers dime. Gender affirming care should be considered an elective, and before anyone brings it up, so should drugs like viagra.
Biological men in women's sports - this idea is absolutely insane and unfair to women.
Making statements like, men can have their period, men can have a baby, using ridiculous terms like, birthing persons., it's too much. I think your average person has no problem with a person who was born male or female but identifies as the opposite sex. I think you'd find a lot more support than you think, but when you take it to the level where you conflate your feelings with actual biology, then you're going to lose that support rather fast.
Pronouns. If you want to be called he/him or she/her then fine, again, you'd probably be surprised by the support that you'd find, however, what is a they/them? And you didn't stop there, no, you had places that made it a crime to wrongfully misgender  someone. 
And lastly, no one can say any one of the things I said without immediately being labeled as a transphobe. There's no room for discussion, it's all or nothing.

Those are the reasons that Republicans were able to so successfully run anti trans messages. 
Republicans aren't afraid of the trans community, they don't hate trans people, and they don't want to take away rights, but what I listed are not rights, they're extremist stances and that's what people who voted had in mind when choosing republican this cycle.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"> Does that seem like something ANYONE would put themselves through, if repressing transness worked?

I don't usually like to talk about it, especially not outside of LGBT spaces, but I'll talk about my experience with the other side of this. 

I had always felt different, in early childhood I was always better friends with the girls, and in my early teenage years I still remember a particular day. This was almost 25 years ago now, I had taken some of my mother's nail polish and damn did I get chewed out for it. I remember the takeaway I had from that conversation was that I was *abnormal* and *wrong* for feeling that way. So I did what you are talking about and tried to hide it away. 

Everything was an excuse I told myself, the very same ones republicans will use, ""A phase"", ""Everyone thinks about if they had been born a girl"", ""A fetish"", everything. I was numb, life sucked. The feelings never went away, and then when I was like 19 I started drinking. 

I drank heavily, I was a barely functional alcoholic - I managed to show up to work through my 20s, but I wouldn't say much else past that. People coming over to my apartment was just a reason to drink more. Because at least when i got drunk, the pain went away for a bit. 

During those years, I contemplated ending it all more times then I can count. Thankfully, I was too much of a coward to go through with it. In 2017 or so, I remember being in such bad spot that my ex told me to stop talking to her and go see a damn therapist with how suicidal I was. In 2018 I ugly cried to my one trans friend that I had no idea who I was, while completely shit faced of course. And then two years after that right before 2020, during my normal PTO during xmas/ny season I finally admitted it to myself. 

I stopped drinking outside of the occasional glass of wine or cocktail at a fancy dinner, and have been otherwise sober for 4 years. I still would not go on to meaningfully do anything about it until earlier this year when I finally started HRT - though I did see a therapist early on in 2020. 

The worst part of this all has been figuring out myself. To use a metaphor, it was like if I had been carefully weaving in little half truths and lies to a glass structure my entire life. Things society expected of me, things I was expected to do. And admitting this was taking a hammer to the entire thing, then sifting through the pieces left behind to try and figure out what's *real*. 

And despite all of this, despite all of the pain and what I did to my body with alcohol, I'm lucky. I'm *alive.*",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"This isn't quite what you asked, but in general trans people really need public support and help pushing back on anti-trans moral panic that currently dominates the national conversation. A few thoughts:




1. If you have social media, a simple post showing support can go a long way, especially if your social media isn't a progressive bubble.

2. Write your representatives (local, state, federal) to expressive your support and urge them to push back on anti-trans policies.

3. If you're not trans, read trans voices, learn about trans issues, learn the arguements supporting trans rights. ACLU, transequality.org, Erin Reed (https://www.erininthemorning.com/), them.us are places to start.

4. Gently engage in person and online with people expressing skepticism over trans rights, particularly those who are otherwise democratic, progessive, or otherwise not too far down the rabbithole.   Key word is gently. Don't call them transphobic or insult them. Most of their undersanding probably comes from right wing propoganda. They need a counter balance and aren't going to listen if you push them away.

"Well actually many things you are saying are from republican spread misinformation. It is not illegal to misgender people accidentally or not anywhere. Gender affirming care for children has never been about surgeries or even irreversible actions only delayed puberty. People in jail “first innocent till proven guilty.” Are not getting surgeries just medication. Is it evil if a women took birth control while locked up? I’d argue not. Despite popular belief jail/prisons were not supposed to be just revenge it was supposed to be rehabilitation. It hurts no one for someone to take medication while in jail or prison. Did you know the statistics on trans athletes? They are not the highest especially for trans women due to a major part of hormones is loss of muscle mass. Plus majority of trans people are not athletes and this idea is pushed alot with saying their should not be trans people at all, granted I have always hated sports but my thought process is like so? It’s highschool or middle school who cares it’s supposed to be a fun game I thought? Why is the statement men can have a period so painful? Like ok who is that hurting? If I made the statement grass is purple then like ok so what? You cannot emphasize with a person with what makes them feel happy, just because you don’t understand someone doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be able to be addressed the way they like to be. Believe it or not their are actually people wanting to take rights from trans people away. This hatred towards trans people has caused many deaths and after trans people became a big target in media trans deaths massively went up. These different talking points create fear hence why it is called transphobia and with fear their generally is hatred and taking the rights from people from accessing medications that help them, discrimination and hate crimes. Sure labels are not the best way to help solve these issues, it is very difficult for people to think about how to best address people that are pushing information that has also been pushed by those that want to do you harm. Transphobia is an action and with real education on what is actually going on and the ability to emphasize comes the ability to stop this. Transphobe is a label and no one is a label is true. Also the people you are most likely referencing usually comes from 3 handpicked extremists advocating for death and pain to those that say transphobic things, most trans people dislike these people also and if you look hard enough on the internet assured you can find someone to show others the point you are trying to make and many right wing news networks that are wanting to spread this information will show the clips from the three extremists that are not actually representative of the trans community in any way.  Also the statement of that trans people are hurting cis women are also inaccurate what is hurting cis women is this fear of trans people just wanting to pee in their preferred bathrooms so vigilantes are on the lookout for anyone that does not pass well to beat up and this has made some cis women get beaten up in this search to target a population based on spread fear when in all actuality a person is not going on hormones for months and years on and on buying extra clothes, makeup and changing their whole lives around just to look at women in the bathroom if a guy is going to do that hes just going to run into the bathroom and do whatever the hell he wants instead of doing all that goes into actually being trans.

When you know somebody ""like that"" it really does help change your view. That's even what happened with Dick Cheney over the years. He came to understand and support equal marriage because his daughter was gay. It's things like that that impact people on a real level.

Dems are leaving it for schools and sporting organizations to decide for themselves, which is ironically what Republicans pretend to want when it comes to things they support.

Ergo why Dems do not engage in blanket bans. What is the issue then? And what exactly do you want Dems to do?

>Their ability to play a sport is definitely not more important to the masses than cost of house, cost of used car, cost of groceries

No.

Democrats haven't done that, and the guidance that the Biden administration regarding Title IX doesn't do that.

"Want to know why some people don’t buy the rhetoric of Trump being a dictator and threat to democracy? It’s because he has been allowed to act the way he has with no repercussions and is about to get back into power.

Look at every cop show/film where the cops are the good guys and practically break every law on the books to apprehend the criminals.

"It was maybe a misstep for the Democrats to spend so much time linking Trump to Hitler, when far more apt and recent analogues exist and are more relevant to key groups they were trying to convince. 

Trump is a lot more like Chavez and Maduro, whose regime was elected on a populist authoritarian/revolutionary platform to fight back against elites, and used that mandate to make Venezuela increasingly authoritarian while collapsing its economy. 

In addition to the self-declared Bolivarians of Venezuela, he also has a lot in common with Peron in Argentina, and MAGA shares a lot in common with the 20th century Mexican PRI or the Zimbabwean ZANU-PF: Populist, nationalist, rhetorically revolutionary and ""anti-elitist"" parties that created new, corrupt elites, eroded democracy, rule of law and consequently the economy in each of their countries - sometimes beyond repair. 

And of course, all of these regimes have had considerable and disturbing human rights abuses and murders of dissidents and people in the way of their corruption.

"Your phrase of the decade should be ""economic Warsaw Pact"".

Trump 2 is going to be Gorbachev and the Soviet Union.  

There is a reason the Soviet Union had to repeatedly crush rebellions in Eastern Europe and had to build a military that could flood hundreds of thousands into a country to do so.  The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe's economies were tied together in a complicated system of interdependent networks, with differing parts specialized to do differing things.  Once the Eastern European countries were able to break away, the Soviet Union itself was finished, because the economic system was finished.

What Trump 2 and to some extent Biden do not realize is that the United States is maintaining its own economic system due to running its own version of an ""economic Warsaw Pact"".  Every decade or so, the restless inhabitants of the economic Warsaw Pact have to be crushed, such as Japan in the 1980s, the Asian Financial Crisis late 1990s, and the 2007-2009 Great Recession.

If the blundering of Trump 2 ever alienates Western Europe to make emergency plans, possibly with Japan and South Korea, to work together with China and the rest of the BRICS, then the economic Warsaw Pact will come tumbling down, and with it the US economic system. 

The analogy to Trump 2 should be the fall of the Soviet Union.  Because that is one of the more plausible options, and it will happen relatively fast, maybe within a year, or even a season.  Various triggers could be an all-out trade war with Europe and a default on the US debt.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

So what,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"*His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans... This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.*

...

*He was incredibly lazy. He wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him.*

...

*He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens.* 

...

*In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish—he would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat ""prodigious amounts of cake""...*

...

*He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.*

"Tried explaining this to a MAGA childhood friend. We don't talk much except he decided to chime in on a post of mine about the economy.

He stopped engaging when I pointed out to him that it was under 45 when the ratio of wealth owned by the ultrawealthy and upper class surpassed that of the entire middle class for the first time (since the 1970). You can find it in Pew research about the wealth gap under his administration, despite American productivity being at record high levels for any point in human history.

I argued that, it's not that we can be more efficient, but that pay per worker's efficiency output has decreased relative to inflation and the costs of living under current trends, starting with Reagan's Trickle Down and continuing to today. That it's CEO and board compensation, and stock buybacks, and historic levels of lending (new dollars generated through interest,) that keep the working class families poor.

What do we think?",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"We in the U.S. have largely not seen how it ends. We heard about it second hand. Returning soldiers could tell about it, but it's a world apart from living it. 

I think that America needs to have the current regime run its course. 

Democrats have protected the nation against the full weight of Trumpism, trying to stop the worst excesses whenever possible. And so our people, ignorant of history and incapable of reflection, believe that his promises of a Great America built on his unfettered power will come with no cost to themselves. I have now come to believe that we need to simply let the march of fascism and authoritarianism run its course. We need to see the economy whipsaw from one destructive extreme to another as the Fed is ordered to exert its authority on the whims of the President. We need to see our allies abandon almost a century of American leadership and protection, leaving us without influence or friends. We need to see our trading partners turn away while we attempt to drive a national economy with small-town resources. We need to reap the whirlwind, as had Europe, to repudiate the tempting mythology that fascism promotes.

After almost two decades leading the Republican Senate Caucus, Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell has finally been replaced.

Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) will be the new Senate Majority Leader, after Republican senators voted to replace McConnell on Wednesday. He will assume the mantle when the new Congress is sworn in early next year. Republicans won back the Senate majority earlier this month, turning four seats red.

"From what I understand:


1. He accepted the results of the 2020 election.
2. He was not interested in entertaining conspiracy theories about the election being stolen in 2020.
3. He previously lost his own Senate election by 500 votes but did not contest the results, showing faith in the electoral process and a desire to avoid unnecessary public expense.


He was selected as majority leader through an anonymous ballot, which protects Republican senators from backlash over their voting choices.


It seems he faced significant criticism from Trump after the 2020 election, which hurt his chances for reelection to the Senate.


Although he appears committed to allowing Trump’s recess appointment picks, if he wants to become Senate leader, he must recognize that Trump has a history of being vocal and hostile toward leaders who do not align with his agenda. This could result in Trump exerting pressure to change the leadership.


The best strategy may be to give Trump the impression that all is well and that cooperation exists until he is firmly in the Senate leadership role. 


This approach could also make him a target for criticism for refusing to bring certain legislation to the Senate, especially when many Republican senators may not want to oppose Trump publicly. It might be more beneficial to have a pre-MAGA senator in charge, as they are more likely to act as a check on MAGA influences and limit Trump's impact in the long run, particularly regarding poor legislation.

They are just really disliked because it does circumvent congresses abilities. Also it has it downsides such as the position can only last 2 years and depending on how the position was achieved it could be unpaid, there’s certain rules regarding that which I don’t recall off the top of my head.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"> I say the guardrails have gotten stronger.

Yes and No.  Power was given to the executive because of legislative gridlock and their inability to respond quickly to highly technical issues that they know nothing about.

With chevron being dismantled, we now have to have congress make extremely specific and nuanced rules on highly technical matters.  At best case, they will do exactly what the administrations are doing today, and at worse they will either not act (permitting bad actions), or pass laws that are unscientific (actively allowing things that should not be). However, laws are written by politicians and lobbyests, whereas administrative rules are typically informed by staff scientists and engineers.  That is an implicit guardrail, allowing qualified technical people to be involved in the process without requiring an act of congress.

With a Trump administration being headed by bad actors, at worse case will be allowing bad things during his tenure.  However, because those bad administrative rules could be undone by a following administration, I would argue that is much better than having an ignorant or captured congress fix bad policy into law.  Thus, there is implicit guardrail that exists by the lack of permanency of an administrative rule.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

* Not all Republicans are MAGA loons. Not even most people who voted for Trump are MAGA loons. They're Republicans. And even a few Rubios and Thunes in the right places could serve as potential bulwarks against some true lunacy. As will public approval ratings, as those Trump-voting Republicans continue to Google, ""How can I change my vote?""
* Republican legislative majorities don't tend to get a lot done, as a rule. They couldn't repeal the ACA, and it took them how many votes to elect a Speaker last year (lookin' at you McCarthy - proud'a you!)? And they basically function as two little feuding sub-parties now.
* Donald Trump ran to stay out of jail. He doesn't want to ""be President."" He wants to golf and tweet and do rallies and feel like the most loved person in the room. He is severely damaged, and being old ain't helping. There's some revenge tour shit coming, I've no doubt. Unless he gets distracted.
* If Trump were to shuffle off to f'king Buffalo, JD Vance takes over. JD Vance is not a Beltway insider, and has relatively little experience in governing roles of any kind. He's a shit gibbon with no spine and less ability to get things done. There's no way he could manage an effective governing strategy amongst the party. He doesn't have the skill set, and more importantly, he doesn't have the respect of the Republican party.

Clearly indicates an intention not to permit recess appointments.

I think the Republicans have boxed themselves in with Trump; there was no other Republican nominee who could have secured the votes to win the presidency. There seem to be two factions within the party: the traditional Republicans who want to implement legislation and pursue a broader agenda, and the MAGA Republicans who create cultural divides and act impulsively, like toddlers that other Republicans try to control. Additionally, there are Republicans who attempt to align with MAGA while actually understanding how to navigate the Senate effectively.

I think the maga republicans lack strategy and short term impulsive thinking gets in the way of the republicans a lot of the time.

3. His egotistical nature leads him to govern in a monarch-like manner. While this can be problematic, it allows him to implement policies primarily through executive orders. These orders are temporary (easily reversed by the next president) and subject to judicial review. Because of the limited resources allocated to developing these executive orders, they are more likely to be overturned compared to legislation passed through Congress.
4. This dynamic enables Republicans to avoid the difficult task of advocating for controversial legislation or policies that resonate with MAGA or Republican talking points, such as immigration reform or issues related to the Affordable Care Act.

Overall, this allows Republicans to navigate the political landscape without directly addressing unpopular topics.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

">“We must act quickly and decisively to get the president’s nominees in place as soon as possible, & all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments. We cannot let Schumer and Senate Dems block the will of the American people,” Thune said on X.

I'm not sure why you can't see that this means he'll agree at the drop of a hat, but I do concede it's up to interpretation.

"Ty. :) To add to that, I also thought about mentioning the fact that he's younger than me. I'm 41, and I can tell you right now, as accomplished as I feel in my position in my own job, I would by no means feel capable of going toe-to-toe with my boss 20 years older unless I absolutely knew what the fuck I was talking about. Or her bosses, God forbid, around the same age. And not just because of the age. I feel respected in the job I do, and I feel my opinion is treated by them as such. But like most people on the right side of the Dunning-Kruger spectrum, I'm very well aware that half of my life to date was spent being an infant/teenager/pot-smoking college kid, and that means that, baseline, I have half the professional (and) life experience of the people I operate under.

Don't get me wrong, when you're McConnelling out on live television, it's really time to consider passing the mic, but on that same token, I have 70+ year old parents who will school me on anything from philosophy to personal finance to Shakespeare to home improvement if I'm not careful, so I very much respect the value of experience that comes with age (some call it wisdom :P).

Jesus Loses His Cool Over Being Called Out On Not Washing His Hands - Luke 11:37-41



As Jesus was speaking, one of the Pharisees invited him home for a meal. So he went in and took his place at the table. His host was amazed to see that he sat down to eat without first performing the hand-washing ceremony required by Jewish custom. Then the Lord said to him, “You Pharisees are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you are filthy—full of greed and wickedness! Fools!

2018 “You have consistently called for enormous cuts to the CDC, the NIH, and the WHO,” a White House reporter tells Trump. “You’ve talked a lot today about how these professionals are excellent, are critical, are necessary. Does this experience give you pause about those cuts?”


“No,” Trump responded. “We can get money, we can increase staff—we know all the people. This is a question I asked the doctors before. Some of the people we cut, they haven’t used for many, many years, and if we have ever need them we can get them very, very quickly. And rather than spending the money—I’m a business person.

Bluesky has been a breath of fresh air in that regard. Is it a little echoey right now? Probably, but A) I don't partake in political discussions on either X or Bluesky anyways, and B) I value organic engagement without needing to second-guess if anyone is a bot over needing to comb through oodles of bots, homophobia, and racism to find said organic engagement. I had been off-and-on switching between X and Bluesky, but with the mass exodus of users to Bluesky, I feel like that platform has a self-sustaining population now. It's quite nice. I haven't looked back at X since. 

I also wouldn't be surprised if The Guardian was making a financial decision here. I work in marketing for a tech company in a field that's quite popular on X. Our following on X is almost 4x what it is on the Meta platforms. Despite this, our ads on Meta perform *much* better than our ads on X, even when we would spend much more money on X ads. Working with our ads manager on the X team also feels akin to pulling teeth, when our ads manager on the Meta team is a rockstar.

In general I'd say:

 Twitter before censorship > X > twitter with heavy censorship. 

Never forget WHO started this process. Not just on twitter but on Facebook, instagram, YouTube, reddit, etc. Musk actually pushed back against that a little bit. It would be even better if Musk just allowed words like 'cis gender' and such, and that is how twitter actually was before purists censored to the left.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"> Is “ultra left” code for “anybody I disagree with”?

Also, apparently they remove as much stuff asked by governments as the old Twitter management did.

"Nope. Uses an entirely different protocol. You may get half way there with gateways, but they'll never be simple.

And to be honest, it's got a poison pill in its ""federation"" which means it'll never be truly federated. Bluesky has three elements to its federation - personal data servers, app views, and relays. The latter is how the other two communicate, and it literally requires the person running it have all of the posts stored on it. All of the posts. For all time.

So, if Bluesky became as popular as, say, Twitter, Bluesky and its competitors would need equal amounts of resources if they want to run relays, which of course wouldn't happen, the ""competitors"" would all use Bluesky's relays until one of the VCs realizes they're paying the competition and shuts down external access. Then competitors have to decide whether they want to run a massive data farm costing hundreds of millions a year at short notice.

"Thankfully the bill failed to pass the House due to the House being in suspension meaning a 2/3 majority was needed to pass this bill. 

Edit: for those wondering the bill is HR 9495 which would allow the Trump admin to remove the non-profit status of organizations for supporting ""terrorism"" without the need to provide evidence or reasoning.


""Under the bill, once an organization is notified about its ""terrorist supporting"" designation, it would have 90 days to appeal before it is stripped of its 501(c)(3) status.

The law would not require Treasury officials to explain the reasoning behind the decision or for the department to provide evidence.""",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"> The bill would give secretaries of the United States Treasury the power to designate nonprofit organizations as ""terrorist-supporting"" and, thus, strip those groups of their tax-exempt status. The bill's passage would apply the amendments made in it to taxable years after its enactment, including those of the incoming Trump administration.

> The current version of the bill, which Representative Claudia Tenney introduced, is paired with a provision that offers tax relief to Americans who are ""unlawfully or wrongfully detained abroad, or held hostage abroad.""

No need to read between the lines, this is pretty typical for Republicans. They use vague wording or broad language and then get to dictate for themselves what falls under the purview of that language.

""Terrorist supporting"" could easily apply—***according to Republicans***—to any non-profit that's advocated for innocent civilians in Gaza for instance.

Even any non-profit that's advocated for LGBTQ, abortion rights, or BLM.

And therein lies the disingenuousness of the Republican agenda. They try to pass legislation like this, knowing full well how they'll abuse it, and when it fails to pass, the GOP exploits the opportunity to accuse democrats of being ""terrorist sympathizers."" It's kind of a lose-lose situation (or a win-win depending on your perspective). However, this nuance isn't important to those pushing their narratives.

Think about how they do this with ""election integrity"" laws that use election denying language to suppress and subvert the vote, or laws targeting public school curricula, or even laws that use language like ""pornography"" and ""sexual orientation."" Also, think about how Republicans will apply this tactic to laws that target immigrants, children of immigrants, asylum seekers, those on a pathway to citizenship, etc...

Imagine if Democrats tried to pass a bill like this, with less extreme language of course, that targeted the tax exempt status of churches. Conservatives would be in an uproar.

And what's to stop another incarnation of the bill being passed next year?

> In a blog post urging members of Congress to kill the bill, Kia Hamadanchy, ACLU's senior policy counsel, said, ""The freedom to dissent without fear of government retribution is a vital part of any well-functioning democracy, which is why Congress must block H.R. 9495 before it's too late.

I appreciate the sentiment, especially considering the ACLU is a nonprofit that some Republicans might label ""terrorist supporting,"" but let's see how well ""dissent"" fares after January 20th of next year... You know, considering Trump and those in his closest orbit have threatened to wreak vengeance on the opposition. Freedom of dissent? Laughable. Republicans have made it clear that only *they* are entitled to these kinds of freedoms.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"OP, I fear you're spreading misinformation, albeit in part because the article you posted has several factual inaccuracies. The bill in question would allow the secretary of the treasury to strip tax exempt status from organizations sending material support to foreign terrorist organizations. ""Foreign terrorist organizations"" is an existing designation that is subject to judicial review.

Furthermore, the designation of terrorist supporting organizations (the US nonprofits supposedly sending aid to foreign terrorist organizations) under this bill would also fall under judicial review. So no, the secretary would not have the unchecked power to designate any non-profit as a supporter of terrorism without providing any evidence. That's just straight up wrong. The designation would be subject to IRS internal review and any court challenges, and it would have to meet the specific standards set out in the bill.

"It's really complicated, I think. Now browse my most recent comments as that is a nice intersection between my Lebanese side and American side.

But while a secular humanist, culturally I am very much a Lebanese Shiaa (think someone who is culturally Jewish, or culturally Catholic).

It's just a sect of Islam. To make an incredibly long and convoluted story short, Israel invaded Lebanon in the 1980s, a resistance was formed, and essentially it was mostly composed of members of my sect.

Now my country Lebanon after a long civil war (yeah, like I said, long convoluted history) starts this peace process that is supposed to transition into some form of democracy at some point, but in stages.

To make another long story short, it starts with the different sects and their political leaders/representation sharing power equally and then they realize if we share power than we actually never have to give it up lol. So they basically ruled over us like feudal lords and oligarchs but occasionally would act like an actual modern state or has had some features of a modern state.

**Well, the main party that represents my sect and serves as the popular support base for said party is the party known as  Hezbollah**.

I think you can see the problem now.

Basically, I am radically opposed to them for a variety of reasons. But they have flat out murdered people that have opposed them,.

There's a whole war now here, and we don't know what the future will look like, but what I can tell you for sure is that **we absolutely need some kind of LBJ** because fascists, the billionaire class, death-cultists, self-serving corrupt politicians, boomer men into dirty politics and dirty money, etc., - they don't give up power easily and if you give them an inch they take a mile.

I may be a mini-mini-mini figure like that for a tiny tiny part of Lebanon some day, as a few people have told me I should run for office (it's just so complicated here,  and again historically they'd either rig the election [like unironically, I mean this lol] or threaten you or just kill you depending on how much of a threat you are.

We haven't gotten to that point in the U.S. , I hope/think.

**Sp please fight like hell guys. Starting from now, you can't be anything but daily active participants in this audacious political experiment in a diverse tolerant multicultural multiethnic multiracial politically diverse democratic republic. **

I so recognize all the amazing work Biden has done, I absolutely recognize the excellent campaign VP Harris and Gov. Walz ran.

Unfortunately it's not even a drop in the bucket of what we need to fight this movement toward a so-called ""post-democratic order"" (I think project 2025 puts it in those terms right? someone fact check me).

So yeah, we have stoics on democracy's siide both here in Lebanon and in the U.S. 

We really do.

But we have not been enabled to come to the arena in some cases, in other cases (e.g., again, in Lebanon) it may be deadly to try.

Either way, it's time we actually show ourselves who we really are.

And I promise you, especially given that America welcomed my immigrant Muslim parents with open arms in the 80s, the America we see today is not who we really are.

This iis disinformation. This is working class people hurting. And this is shit like billionaires uniting the crazy people that normally never even know of each other and turning them into a whole MAGA cult (e.g., Musk and twitter).

So we're figfhting big forces, and these but a few.

"I'm not saying it's a good law. It was just misrepresented. 

Also the ACLU would not be providing material aid in the scenario you outlined. It would need to be direct aid to the organization. Representing an individual is not the same as providing aid to an organization. An individual and an organization are different legal entities. 

>Meanwhile, the Secretary can strip the status and they don't have to even provide a reason. Pray tell, what is the consequence to the Secretary is they repeatedly strip the status and keep the org in a perpetual legal battle?

So if you read the bill, the secretary must provide a specific list of groups being supplied and give the domestic non-profit/NGO the opportunity to cut off aid to those groups. And if they cease aid, then they could maintain their non-profit status.

You're correct that it would make sending aid to conflict zones more complicated and less efficient, but I don't think it would end aid altogether. Whether you favor this bill or not depends on your priorities. Do you prioritize security or maximizing international humanitarian missions? That's the trade off under consideration.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Sure, but that's a problem under existing law as well. The government already has the authority to designate FTOs subject to judicial review.

This law just makes it easier to connect FTOs to domestic NGOs and non-profits through interdepartmental information sharing. US NGOs would definitely face more scrutiny, don't get me wrong, but it's not as dire as people are saying.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I mean, I don't think they're necessarily wrong, here. But keep in mind that the Treasury already has the ability to dock non-profit status from these organizations if they suspect illegal activity. That's not new. What this bill does is enable the sharing of information (particularly classified information) between departments. That *will* result in more non-profits being flagged, I have no doubt. But why are they being flagged? 

Let's be real, a lot of these aid organizations need to bribe foreign terrorists in order to operate in conflict zones. They need to bribe Hamas to operate in Gaza, as an example. The CIA knows that these bribes take place, but they can't share information with the IRS. This bill would change that.

So if we want to get down to brass tax, the real moral quandary is this: is it okay for American non-profits to bribe terrorists in order to disperse aid in conflict zones? I don't think that's an easy question to answer. Non-profits are against this bill because they feel the bribes are worth it, obviously. That's a valid opinion, IMO.

>this bill removes necessary red tape and safeguards and throws them into court with less means to defend themselves than through current procedure.

No, it doesn't do that. The ACLU is exaggerating a bit, here. This bill does not fundamentally change the process through which non-profits are stripped of their non-profit status.

EDIT: Lol, this guy asks for sources and then someone blocks me. It's all right here in the text of the US code and the proposed bill.

The purpose of this law is to enable the sharing of classified national security information between the State Department and the Treasury. That's really the only change it makes.

"This bill existed long before Trump, just wanted to point out. It's not really about him. The problem this bill is trying to solve is the well-known issue of American non-profits bribing terrorist organizations in conflict zones in order to disperse aid unhindered by said terrorist organizations. Some people think these tribes are unethical. Some people think they are worth it. It depends on your perspective.

>There's nothing here to make me think this passing wouldn't be used to go after groups Trump has problems with.

I suspect he would do this regardless. The IRS already has the authority to strip non-profit status from these organizations. If Trump wants to do that, the white house could literally just fabricate evidence. There's nothing stopping them now, under existing law. Of course it would be quite the scandal if that happened, but that's a different issue.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"You're not understanding what I'm saying. This bill has nothing to do with due process. It doesn't change the process of removing non-profit status at all. 

The process today is as follows: the IRS finds evidence that a non-profit is violating the law. The IRS notifies the non-profit that it plans to strip non-profit status if the law-breaking activity doesn't cease. The non-profit can file an internal appeal within the IRS, and there's an extensive review process. If that review does not change the original findings of the IRS, the non-profit can sue the IRS in federal court to maintain its non-profit status.

The bill in question does not change that process. It gives the IRS access to state department and classified information, information which *would be shared in court* if the non-profit sues the IRS.

Again, I need to emphasize that an organization does not need to be charged with a crime in order to be stripped of non-profit status. This has *always* been an administrative process. No prosecutors involved. If an organization doesn't like the outcome of the administrative process, they sue in federal court.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

Copeland is one of the televangelists associated with the Prosperity Gospel, which falsely claims God rewards faith with wealth, health, and success. The ideology distorts biblical teachings by emphasizing material gain rather than spiritual development. Theologically, it is not rooted in authentic Christian doctrine and often exploits followers by demanding financial ""seeds"" in exchange for divine blessings.

It is a ""false teaching"" used to get you to pay for their lifestyle because ""God"" told you to.

[The extravagant lifestyle of Copeland has been widely criticized, including private jets, mansions, and a tax-exempt church empire](https://nypost.com/2021/12/17/kenneth-copeland-wealthiest-us-pastor-lives-on-7m-tax-free-estate/). According to him, [commercial flights are full of demons, so he needed a private jet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LtF34MrsfI). His theatrical ""[blowing away"" of the COVID-19 virus during a sermon, claiming to eradicate the virus through his divine authority, sparked further controversy. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSIrQBGfUtw)

**The move was widely skepticism and ridicule - As it should be!**

These actions show the dangers of Prosperity Gospel leaders like Copeland, whose teachings often prioritize personal wealth and theatrics over authentic Christian values like humility, sacrifice, and justice. As a result, their approach undermines the true message of faith, which emphasizes love, service, and stewardship over self-enrichment.

Makes sense that a grifter like Trump would align himself with someone like Copeland. Mainline and educated Christian leaders would identify Trump as against Christ's teachings. So, in order to give a false impression of piety and religiosity Trump chose this clown.

**But then again, I guess when you're the complete opposite of what Jesus actually teaches you need all the help you can get.**

"""Trumps spiritual advisor""? Bro this shit needs to fuckin stop...

Trump engages with pundits that give him results. Copeland is a fucking pseudo cult leader/con man but hey - he reaches MILLIONS of people. 

The guy's a piece of shit (and I wish the pope would weigh in on his brand of Christianity to at least invalidate this dude but I think his followers might be too far gone - maybe he has but Im not interested enough in/dont hate Copeland enough to take a personal interest in his life, despite the fact that the guy is a puss filled asshole) BUT he has the following to boost the numbers and that's all Trump cares about. 

Like imagine having to choose a variety pack of chips. One pack - you like 4 out of 5 flavors. Second pack, you only like 2 out of 5 flavors. 

You're gonna buy the former pack and after a while, you might even start to like that 5th flavor. 10 years of this shit - just buying the same variety pack, getting used to what you expect from it.. don't act surprised when this shit slides in one direction or the other. 

I don't think labeling Copeland as a ""Spiritual Advisor"" helps? Like c'mon man, Copeland's gonna focus on his own cult and Trump's gonna Trump unless there's business incentive for Copeland to do more than just show up at a rally. 

Please - stop pre-emptively taking this shit to some ideological level before actually thinking about it. Copeland wants to be wealthy/relevant but not as much as Trump does. He made a guest spot to ride some coat tails - I really don't see Trump, as unpredictable as he is, endorsing mega churches as some new national religion.

I'm not a Trumper, but ffs this is business. Don't make mountains out of mole hills and attack guys like this without having to loop them into other controversial figures - you can break them down on their own - all depending on the strength of your argument (and good luck having any political discourse that changes anyone's ideals).

I suppose to an extent, you also are muddying the waters by even trying to tie this all into one coherent belief system to attack. Like in the case of LGBTQ, there are many churches with varying views on this, including some of acceptance.

In short, my stance is that ""so completely obvious"" is probably either a layman's take or an emotional reaction. Which is fine, like I said, none of us can be the oracle on every topic. But, grounds for flippant dismissal? No. That is self-righteous ignorance.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"Anyone else think Elon is about to flip from full MAGA to complete leftist? If Trump upsets him and basically says “whelp I don’t need you anymore, you annoy me, thanks but bye”, I can ABSOLUTELY see Elon changing the entirety of his perception to make himself a victim of “Trump’s lies and conspiracy”. Hell, he may even start to blame Trump for his poor relationship with his trans daughter. After all, despite always being a rich egotistical and entitled dick that always thinks he’s right and got his money and prominence from his colonial family, he initially tried to spotlight himself as a progressive with big talk about “changing to electric instead of gas to “help the environment”” and stuff. And, tbh, there are a TON of historical “leftists” that were rich egotistical and entitled dicks that always thought they’re right and got their money and prominence from their families’ dealings in colonialism. 

And tbh, I think his base cares more about Elon’s opinions being Elon’s than what those opinions even are. I don’t think he’d get a level of backlash that would make him any more uncomfortable than the current level he’s receiving. If anything, it might be easier cause it could position him in a more diverse bubble of reassurance and praise that would also bring more advertisers onto his platform and lower the criticisms of environmental groups against him.

That’s not even to mention how many people Trump has pissed off to the point that they “betrayed” him. The only difference is that every single one of those people were less powerful and influential than Trump. Elon is, honestly, more powerful and influential.

However, calling Russia ""the gas station that paid for it"" is myopic. Russia was the intellectual, cultural and managerial backbone of the Soviet Union. Ukraine SSR was simply the province chosen for a lot of industry due to the easy access to coal reserves.

Moreover, in modern post-Soviet space, Russian demographics are quite good (at least for non-Muslim countries), so picking up former USSR vassals for their ""demographics"" would be counterintuitive.

"From a WSJ article on this:

> But some former officials believe the incoming Trump administration is looking to politicize the military.
> 
> “Do they start wearing MAGA hats in formation to signal who’s where?” asked one former senior Pentagon official. “The potential for this to go wrong is infinite.”
>
> The president has the power to fire generals but rarely does so for political reasons. President Harry Truman fired Army Gen. Douglas MacArthur for publicly challenging the administration’s Asia security strategy. President Barack Obama fired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal as his Afghanistan commander after the military leader’s subordinates were quoted as criticizing the administration in a magazine article.
>
> U.S. troops take an oath of office to the Constitution and vow to not follow any illegal order, and Congress must approve the promotion of general officers.
>
> But establishing a board separate from the current process, which uses serving officers, could undermine the idea that generals refrain from sharing their political views within the Pentagon. It could also potentially prompt officers not to speak out against orders they believe are illegal, says Eric Carpenter, professor of military law at Florida International University College of Law.
>
> “This looks like an administration getting ready to purge anyone who will not be a yes man,” said Carpenter, a former Army lawyer. “If you are looking to fire officers who might say no because of the law or their ethics, you set up a system with completely arbitrary standards, so you can fire anyone you want.”",2024_11_14,05_43_09

>The Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda has already catalyzed more than $860 billion in business investments through smart, public incentives in industries of the future like electric vehicles (EVs), clean energy, and semiconductors. With support from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act, these investments are creating new American jobs in manufacturing and clean energy and helping communities that have been left behind make a comeback.

.....

>Today’s actions to **counter China’s unfair trade practices** are **carefully targeted at strategic sectors**—the same sectors where the United States is **making historic investments** under President Biden to create and sustain good-paying jobs

.....

>The tariff rate on certain steel and aluminum products under Section 301 will increase from 0–7.5% to 25% in 2024.
  
>The tariff rate on semiconductors will increase from 25% to 50% by 2025.

......
>Through the CHIPS and Science Act, President Biden is making a nearly $53 billion investment in American semiconductor manufacturing capacity, research, innovation, and workforce. This will help counteract decades of disinvestment and offshoring that has reduced the United States’ capacity to manufacture semiconductors domestically. **The CHIPS and Science Act includes $39 billion in direct incentives to build, modernize, and expand semiconductor manufacturing** fabrication facilities as well as a 25% investment tax credit for semiconductor companies. **Raising the tariff rate on semiconductors is an important initial step to promote the sustainability of these investments.**

Tariffs are there but also a plan to create and invest in what the tariffs are doing

""We examine conventional approaches to evaluating the economic impact of protectionist trade policies. We illustrate these conventional approaches by applying them to the tariffs introduced by the Trump administration during 2018. In the wake of this increase in trade protection, the United States experienced substantial increases in the prices of intermediates and final goods, dramatic changes to its supply-chain network, reductions in availability of imported varieties, and the complete pass-through of the tariffs into domestic prices of imported goods. Therefore, the full incidence of the tariffs has fallen on domestic consumers and importers so far, and our estimates imply a reduction in aggregate US real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018. We see similar patterns for foreign countries that have retaliated with their own tariffs against the United States, which suggests that the trade war has also reduced the real income of these other countries.""",2024_11_14,05_43_09

The costs for construction don't immediately trickle into the other markets, it takes a while. That's one of the reasons housing costs EXPLODED in 2021-2023. We weren't building things at the rate we need and the costs to build were higher, so developers asked for higher prices to cover costs.

The problem is that the tariffs on Chinese chassis have shot the cost through the roof, and also added to the cost of manufacturing replacements in America, as the machinery and parts are likewise taxed. 

Consequently, there is a shipping problem in America. That has driven up transport costs and added snags and delays to internal manufacturing and commercial supply lines, making American commerce and industry less efficient - a drag on the economy as a whole. 

Trump as promised to increase these tariffs and others on items critical for building out manufacturing capacity of which America has a shortage.

You probably do know that increases in the money supply, supply chain disruptions, increases in energy costs globally, etc were already starting up under Trump and that those sort of economic impacts take time to play out and there wasn't just some action Biden did on day 1 that caused it.

It’s not just Covid that aided corporations to raising prices on everything, tariffs did as well. And honestly, Covid didn’t even hurt the corporate economy that much. If anything it helped them sell more products. Thusly, these companies would have to import more and with tariffs their costs rose leading to increased prices on everything.

And then constantly refusing to listen to experts to help the public such as endorsing or implementing things like social distancing or mandatory quarantines and masks until it started backfiring and fucking up his voter base.

The only corporations that showed any promise were either too big to fail, or entirely e-commerce based (like Amazon). It absolutely did not help companies sell more products, not sure what sort of logic even brought you to that conclusion. 

Many companies bypassed the 2018 tariffs by planning ahead and changing their cadence of purchasing from Asia, leading to little to no increase in prices of consumer goods (which will happen again). Most of the 2018 tariffs were changed or removed almost entirely, they are used as a negotiating tactic and have a proven track record of being effective.

Lying about what? I said most of the tariffs were amended or removed. What you linked shows us that his tariffs were amended and it’s a fact that steel and aluminum tariffs were removed so seems like we agree,2024_11_14,05_43_09
I don’t think anyone is trying to convince you otherwise about Cuomo. There is a reason he is not in charge anymore and I think you would agree he should not be in charge again correct?  Now extrapolate the same logic as to why Trump also mishandling tariffs and Covid is more than enough reason as to why he shouldn’t be put in charge again. Hope this makes sense.

"I don't know how many articles like this I'm going to read but I find them all pretty annoying. Guess I'm glad to not just have sex with random women. Glad to be with a partner who doesn't view sex as transactional. Glad to not have to really give a shit about any of this.

And y'know... good for these women, I guess. It's just sad that they're in these kinds of relationships in the first place which have led them to feel like they need to use sex as a commodity. Even still, I doubt their lives are going to get better or easier as a result of this. Not many people positively change their minds in a marriage as a result of *less* intimacy. 

And if you're talking about swearing off sex outside of a committed relationship... again... good. Like... don't date MAGA idiots and you won't have to give up sex.

Edit: Reading the ""article"", it's even dumber. I get that more men voted for Trump than Harris, but so many men like me voted for Harris as well. If there's this tremendous gender gap that only leads to the conclusion of ""men bad, women good"", you know what's bound to help? Further separation. (/s)

It isn’t just about swearing off sex with some men to coerce them into something. It’s about avoiding men in general because it is such a damn nuisance to sort through looking for the one who not only says he agrees you are a real person, but acts like it. All the time, not just when he wants sex or emotional support. 

Just look at the arguments about how “women need to get over politics” and date Trump supporters because of “the epidemic of male loneliness.” Yeah. A lot of men are lonely. But that doesn’t make it the job of women, as a group, to keep doing the emotional labor, the kin keeping and all the other work just so guys don’t have to grow up and can live in their Andrew Tate fantasies forever. 

We’ve got a mob of incels running the GOP now because we’ve got a mob of incels who looked at how much work it would take to be decent men and decided they’d rather strip women of the autonomy to avoid them.

It is not enough to attack non supporters. It doesn't matter if they deserve it or if you're right. You need more votes to get what you want, and many of these movements are simply creating additional data points for people not yet involved to view your movement as extreme or hostile.

I've always voted Democrat.

I did very well with women in high school. Moved away for college and dropped out to open the business, but my social life has never recovered. Had a bad relationship for a couple years before opening the business. Once that relationship ended and I opened the company, I dated around a little, moved again (a big part of my problem dating I think), but the dates, relationships, and casual encounters became a lot less frequent. I also started to find that none of the situations I encounter are desirable anymore. The one time every few years I feel a romantic connection, the woman has a boyfriend. The times women seem interested in casual encounters, they seem like they're going to get me into trouble (and also often have boyfriends). The women who want to go on dates are young and have been pretty unrelatable. IDK exactly what that barrier is, but it just makes me feel old and out of touch with the young people's zeitgeist. Also like they don't see the aspects of myself that I want them to appreciate.

I feel like a catch, particularly so once I get my new place and get this second business to be profitable. But there are no apparent avenues to enjoy anything with women other than friendship for me lately. There's a group of young women who invite me out to bars and parties, but they're mostly unavailable and feel a bit hard to relate to. I have a good time dancing and hanging out with random women in clubs. I went up to Vancouver last weekend and had a good time. Those encounters with women in bars never go anywhere anymore though.

I finally gave in and started paying for tinder a few days ago. Kinda feels bad, but we'll see how that goes. I haven't been on a date in years, I just want someone to go to nice places with.

And as a result, the apps always leave women feeling like the selection is bountiful and that there's always a bigger fish in the sea, to the point where women that meet guys on dating apps never have more than one foot in the door at any given time.  

That's why the dating itself has suffered so hard.  Dating prospects have been commodified, and the supply/demand curve is so harshly against men's favor, that it's kinda pointless to even bother at all.  I recommend getting a cat or a dog. lol",2024_11_14,05_43_09

So my kid is a good kid and we get along pretty great. He's on reddit but mostly youtube. So he ofcourse gets exposed to the whole mensrights/health movement. I always tried to keep that conversation in the open, you know trying to keep extremist like tate out of his algorythms and genuinly wanting to get to know his tought processes. I support alot of the movement actually, the mental health emphasis but also the gym lifestyle stuff, i dig it. And i learned together with him.

So back to the convo that got heated. I had to call my partner to the table cause i knew i was getting too intens about the subject, i wanted him to voice his opinion and like help the kid voice his views without getting intimidated by my reactions.

They both agreed that liberal men stayed home because they feel they are not being heard by the democrats. Thats its all about women, lgbtq and rascism. The right offers a narrative for young men, so young men on the right vote for that. Young men in our society are not being offered a narrative by the left and stay home.

I got really offended at that and really needed to process the statement. Cause for me the idea that men need to be catered to more in an already unbalanced system seemed entitled.

"The only dates I've been on from dating apps were with nervous young women who can't hold a conversation. One actually pulled out a printed list of first date questions, looked at it, and then asked ""what's your favorite color?"" Another only talked about some dude she's never met but was sort of in a long distance online relationship with. OLD got me a few other dates with nervous younger women who offer closed-ended responses in conversation. No dates from apps in the last few years, but now that I'm paying, that could change.

I interact with potentially single women at bars, but any of them who seem to want to go somewhere with me are also doing something that makes me uncomfortable. One time a cute woman at the bar put my hand on her chest and asked if she should leave her boyfriend for me. Another seemed cool enough and bar-hopped with my friends and I for a while, but then got into a fight with another woman and got arrested. The last woman I had a really good romantic connection with ended up revealing her boyfriend eventually and was doing an open relationship thing. I can't tell you how many times women have flirted with me in front of their boyfriends. I've also had customers flirt with me, but I don't make a move because I don't want a weird business reputation, and then it turns out they have a husband. Good instincts to not do anything I guess. 

It feels like there's no reasonable way to connect with the cool, single women. I figure I'm seeing them around various places. I don't seem able to pick them up at bars anymore. I'm sure they've been at the coffee shops, pumpkin patches, and shops downtown that I've been to in the last couple months, but even if I talk to those women it seems so difficult to get that to lead anywhere. Nothing ever seems right.

I like pets, but that's not a replacement for what I want in a romantic partner. That doesn't mean I necessarily have a choice in the matter though. Between this issue and the issues in all my other relationships, I've started to learn how important companionship and love is to me.

">Part of it will probably have to be leaving the aggressively-focus-tested crowd of politicians behind

I completely agree. This was done heavily with both Clinton and Harris: not a word was uttered without carefully crafting and honing it with focus groups and consultants and everything else. It 100% sounds like hogwash to most people. And if you look at AOC's discussions with voters who picked both her and Trump, you'll see that widely reflected. AOC and Trump both come off as authentic to a lot of people.

>how to pander better than cons to the less educated. This crowd sees ""higher taxes and tariffs everwhere"" and think ""things will be cheaper for me.""

I don't think pandering is the answer. Just like I don't think Clinton's laughing about putting coal miners out of work was the answer. I think coming up with a bold, specific, tailored plan to actually make things right with all the people of the Rust Belt and Appalachia who've been hurt by decades of globalization and free trade is a start. And that begins with an acknowledgement. An open, honest acknowledgement of the pain these people are feeling and WHY. Donald Trump says a lot of nonsense, but he's absolutely 100% right when he says to those people that they've been getting screwed by both sides for decades. They absolutely have. And while Trump is almost certainly not going to be helpful to them, he's the first to come out and say what all of those people already know: both major parties have screwed them, their families, their towns, their entire way of life.

>We need to get better at taking a nuanced topic and chunk it into more accessible pieces than the ""low tax always keep more money"" that cons always yell to the masses.

I think there needs to be a more authentic message. One that focuses on kitchen table issues that matter to the vast majority of voters. Identity politics is a loser.

"They thought Harris was bad. Wait till they get a look at   the new Ambassador to Israel, Huckabee who once said :

‘there’s really no such thing as a Palestinian’",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"To those who cast ""protest votes"" against Harris, essentially memory holing Trump's anti-palestinian/muslim record, you should have really considered the implications. 

Harris was vocal about a cease fire, she openly expressed sympathy for innocent civilians in Gaza, she even refused to show up for Netanyahu's performance in Congress earlier this year, performance being the key word there.

Donald Trump however, has an entirely different record as president, and one that illustrates his own self-interests, his transactional politics, and his hardline stance on the war in Gaza. 

Trump cozied up to Netanyahu, and like he has with other autocrats and ""strongmen,"" Trump caved in to Bibi's political pressures.

Let me preface this by saying, I'm an American Jew myself, with Ashkenazi heritage no less, but I've spent time trying to understand this conflict and its complicated history from multiple historical perspectives. 

I don't take an indiscriminate stance on this war, my views are more nuanced, so I understand that not all Palestinians, nor are all Israelis a monolith. I understand that this conflict didn't begin on October 7th. I sympathize with Palestinians who have suffered under military occupation, from collective punishment and the dispossession of their land. I also sympathize with the plight of Jews who suffered from violent pogroms and almost lost their ethnic and national identity as a result of the Jewish diaspora.

I also understand that the two have been engaged in a cycle of violent conflict over land since the end of WWI after the signing of the Balfour Declaration. Some historians might argue it stretches back to the late nineteenth century as ""Zionism out of despair"" became a fledgling movement. Some argue that this conflict began in the mid-20th century, but that ignores decades of history leading up to that moment in time. 

Nevertheless, I can condemn both Hamas (and adjacent terror groups) and Netanyahu as it relates to the current state of the conflict in the region. Netanyahu has made it clear that a two state solution is no solution at all, while Hamas and its allies have also been uncompromising and share the blame in perpetuating this decades-long bloody conflict which has cost countless lives.

Trump's record indicates that he is willing to take an indiscriminate stance on a war he knows nothing about, and mostly because it's what serves him best.

Believe it or not, Trump is responsible for escalating multiple conflicts in the Middle East, some of which the U.S. military was involved in. 

When it comes to his staunch Pro Israel record as president, Trump acknowledged Israel's controversial annexation of Golan Heights, and in December of 2017, formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

This act alone only heightened tensions in the region and weakened the U.S.'s capacity to act as a peace negotiator between Palestinians and Israelis. Such a move was a capitulation to Israeli leaders. While Trump, or more likely his handlers, understood the move was one that would garner them more support from their Christian voters who only see Jews as a means to a biblical end, quite literally mind you.

What's more, Trump's ""Middle East peace plan"" was poorly contrived, amateurish, and a step *away* from peace in the region. As foreign policy goes, it was more of a political stunt than anything else as it also happened to coincide with his re-election campaign. This laughably brief, insincere and ineffective plan also weakened our position as peace brokers in the region.

Donald Trump, by his very nature, doesn't have any specific foreign policy or political philosophy. His only philosophy is ""what's best for me?"" 

So his language can change at any moment depending on what's best for his political career. His rhetoric shifted temporarily after Netanyahu acknowledged Biden's win in 2020. Trump's penchant for holding grudges can sometimes alter his public mood. He's like a temperamental child really.

And that hasn't stopped him from labeling all pro Palestinian protestors as ""radicals."" 

Speaking directly to the pro Palestinian movement, Trump reportedly said,

> “Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, we’re going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,”

Trump has not only vowed to crush pro Palestinian protests, but he's threatened to deport *all* demonstrators. 

Trump has made statements like, they (Israel) ""have to have a victory."" And speaking to Netanyahu, Trump has stated, ""do what you have to do"" in Gaza, while he has also said that we have to ""let Israel finish the job."" 

Republicans in his orbit have also been pushing to annex the West bank, which is a real possibility considering Trump's MAGA coalition is willing to trade their loyalty for a chance to use him to enact their Islamophobic agenda.

Trump hasn't laid out a viable plan for addressing the war in Israel. But Trump's son-in-law and former nepokid, Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, recently suggested that Gaza’s current borders can be redrawn in direct contradiction with current U.S. policy.

> “Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable,” Kushner said

Caution around the controversial topic hasn't kept Trump from stigmatizing Palestinians and pro Palestinian protestors.

Trump has a long history of bigoted remarks and actions taken against Muslims/the Arab world.

Before his presidency, Trump suggested multiple times that the U.S. has a ""Muslim problem."" He even called for the surveillance of Muslims and Muslim communities.

In 2015, he said he will ""look at"" closing mosques.

He defended warantless searches of American Muslims.

Trump once said he would “certainly implement” a database system to track Muslims and encouraged a Muslim registry

He called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.""

He's called Muslims ""sick people.""

Trump appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon once claimed that “the Judeo-Christian west” is engaged in a “global war” against “jihadist Islamic fascism.”

Then there's Trump's first ""Muslim ban"", an executive order banning Syrian refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Trump issued multiple iterations of his Muslim ban after that, including one that barred foreign nationals from eight countries.

Throughout his presidency, Trump reiterated the need for a Muslim ban and extreme vetting process and claimed that crime spikes were the result of ""radical islamic terror.""

While on Twitter, Trump also retweeted posts from an anti-muslim hate group.

Let's not forget the recent ""rally"" at MSG that included a long list of speakers spouting extreme, xenophobic rhetoric and talking points. Some of it directed at Palestinians. Trump even used ""Palestinian"" as a slur during his debate with Biden.

All that being said, there will be consequences from a second Trump presidency. We don't only have Trump to worry about, we have his coalition of far right jingoists and anti-muslim loyalists to worry about as well. They will use him to push an agenda that will have far worse outcomes for Palestinians and Muslims the world over. Not only that, but over the next four years, this agenda will encumber any future progressive efforts.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"It's the ""Instant gratification complex"" a lot of the American public suffer from, where they think that you can change things instantly and get great results. They can't play the long game and don't understand it because their attention span isn't that good as a whole.


Biden has fixed the majority of the damage Trump did in record time but when middle income and low income people look at their earnings deficit compared to five years ago, they don't realise that what actually happened was the quick fix Trump and the republicans did was actually a con.


Low and middle income made more money instantly with his bonkers tax cut plan, following year it was less and almost back to the start, year after they were net loss behind and now even worse.

Whereas all high income and Uber rich made out like bandits... because they can play the long game, it's why they are rich.


But the low income and middle income earners have their view on the timeline as ""It happened under Biden"" not realising it actually happened under Trump and that it's a deliberately delayed trap to make democrats look shit.


You need at least three terms in a row of democrats to repair the damage done by republicans to your financial institutions and to see it's effect (it all takes time) but what happens is you get itchy feet and when it recovers ""surprise surprise"" guess who's in the white house....the republicans.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

Sometimes it’s been entirely successful and sometimes it’s been less so, but it’s very clear that operations like Rafah and even the Iran strikes would have been different without Biden. That’s the reason the Israeli far right opposes Biden. If the U.S. just totally stopped providing any support to Israel, the leverage is gone and they (meaning the far right) will still do whatever they want (which is what will happen now).

My point is that I think Kamala being a woman of color was a strike against her in Latin communities overall. Puerto Ricans and Cubans notwithstanding. Those are tiny demos in the larger cohort.

And you make a good point about Venn diagram and Latinos that identify as white. Look, I lived in Mexico for a year and have been a Californian my whole life. In MANY latin cultures in The America's there is a stigma towards darker skinned people in general. It partly stems from the days of Spaniards and other European colonists invading back then. It's complicated, but it's real. And I'm not trying to pick on Latins...I don't think they are any more or less prejudiced than any other group of humans. We all collectively SUCK on this one.

"Ideology will override logic for the vast majority of people for the vast majority of their decisions.


Part of the Democratic Party's ideology is the notion that decorum is paramount in governance. This gives them a blind faith in the continuation of the United States as a democratic republic. They still think it's improper to undermine the power of the next office. They still think elections will be possible going forward. They can conceptualize the damage promised, they *cannot believe* that it will be or is intended to be comprehensive and permanent.


This isn't to say they get any of the above, or other ideals like ethics, correct all the time. The ideology blinds them in those regards too. But it is why they don't seem to push back the way you think.


We also can't forget that party power has not been absolute in a very long time. The last supermajority was under Obama and lasted something like 72 days. Even then I believe there were right-wing DINOs that prevented the supermajority from truly being such. 


Republicans are experts at undermining political processes because they have the exact opposite ideological preference regarding ethics and decorum and it is much easier to obstruct and destroy than it is to coalesce and build. Democrats clearly feel like their policies must be perfectly executed in accordance with precedence (legal and institutional) to succeed in the face of Republican obstruction.


This continues with another challenge going forward: Dems will not obstruct Republican actions nearly as effectively as Rs could if the roles were 100% reversed. Whether the Dems can or cannot is not important. Inevitably they meter their responses because their ideology demands it. Some of it is for fear of establishing a dangerous precedent that might be used against Dems and citizens in the future... but they were again blind to the fact that they did not need to set the example for Republicans to dive headfirst into that mentality.


We saw this with Merrick Garland. The ONE seat in the federal government that could have freed us from Trumpism was given to a person sympathetic to it in the name of... you guessed it... decorum and blind trust in the persistsnce of America. The threat was absolutely clear and these Neo-Confederates should have been shut down for good.

"He needs to resign to make the investigation go away. If he nakedly resigns, it looks like he knows he'll be found guilty, ousted, and perhaps referred to DOJ. If he resigns under the pretense that it's because he's getting nominated for AG, then that covers his resignation motive. Summary: He may not expect to pass confirmation and is just using it as a ruse to get out of the investigation ""cleanly"".",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"Both houses have to consent. Which, they probably will lol",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I think you mean Article II Section 3. 

But regardless, this is not a correct interpretation. Article II Section 3 is narrow in granting the President the power to recess Congress; he can only recess either house in a ""case of disagreement"" (as outlined in Article I Section 5). Article I Section 5 states that each chamber of congress has the authority to recess for any time-period less than 3 days, but if the Senate (or House) wants to recess for more than 3 days, they need permission from the House (or Senate). But if the House does not agree, the Senate cannot recess, causing a stalemate. At that point, the President is granted power to overrule the House and break the stalemate, allowing the Senate to recess. Or, by refusing to act, he still breaks the stalemate by forcing the Senate to stay in session. 

But the President cannot just force the Senate to recess, *especially* not to force an appointment. SCOTUS affirmed this **unanimously** in *NLRB v. Noel Canning* in 2014. 

The following is a direct quote from [constitution.congress.gov](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S5-C4-1/ALDE_00013353/#ALDF_00023200)'s synopsis of Article II Section 2 Clause 3 (the Overview of Recess Appointments Clause), emphasis mine:
 
> Even under a broad interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate may limit the ability to make recess appointments by exercising its procedural prerogatives. The Court in *Noel Canning* held that, for the purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, **the Senate is in session when the Senate says it is**, provided that, under its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business. In this vein, ***Noel Canning* provides the Senate with the means to prevent recess appointments by a President who attempts to employ the subsidiary method for appointing officers of the United States (i.e., recess appointments)**",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Link to where he said that? I understand he said that they were 'on the table' in a tweet a little bit ago but this was before Gaetz.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"You don't understand the reasoning behind it? Seriously? 

Trump picked Gaetz because he: 

* is very loyal to Donald Trump, defending him and counter attacking for him no matter what. 

* was a target of DOJ probes into serious crimes, like Trump was. So Trump thinks Gaetz is primed to take revenge on enemies within the DOJ. This is Trump's first and maybe only priority for the DOJ, to take revenge on those who dared threaten him with accountability. 

That's why he picked him. It's pretty straightforward.

What criteria did you think Trump would use to pick his AG?",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Probably but special election turnout is low so anything could happen.,2024_11_14,05_43_09

Trump tapping the house for cabinet positions when they have such a small hold is part of how one can tell that he's an actual idiot and not a talented cosplayer. His recent choices are so indefensibly bad that I'm wondering if we are going to see him try to nominate a horse to the senate before the term is over. 


They're head scratchers, personally.



Like, if you want to use the DoJ to punish your enemies, then you want a trustworthy and competent AG. Gaetz is notoriously disloyal and his legal experience is basically nothing.


Bill Barr was a huge part of Trump staying out of prison, and he did so via legal trickery during the Trump admin. Gaetz wouldn't be able to rescue Trump the way Barr did.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

It doesn't _raise questions_ about his experience. _He has no relevant experience._ 

And it stuns all the leaders of the entire western military coalition around the fucking world. 

Giving this guy Sec Def is the biggest slap in the face that Trump has yet demonstrated, to the US military, and to every professional military in the world.

And from a global security perspective, we're totally fucked. 

Touting his experience as a Major is hardly a qualification. A Major is like a glorified corporate middle manager, who has never even seen the inside of a boardroom unless it was to deliver a report or refresh the coffee. But beyond that, outside of small unit leadership positions, he has no real world executive leadership experience. He has no international leadership experience. He has no government leadership experience. No Sec Def in the last 70 years has had a resume so completely lacking in qualifications as this guy. 

The Flag Officer Corp are among the most highly educated individuals in any part of our government and have the most overall leadership experience by far. Having him as Sec Def is a personal insult to every single flag officer that will ever have to share a table with him. Even our adversaries will be insulted.

You can argue all you want about DEI and military readiness/capability, and in this case I don't give a fuck if you do, but putting _this guy_ in charge of the US FUCKING MILITARY is like picking a guy with a Cessna rating to fly the 747 that you and your family will be traveling in.

That is the thing about stats, you can perceive them to confirm bias.

The facts are:

Grade level reading was not even measured until the 1930s.

In the 1940s, only about 60% of Americans were at the 6th grade reading level.

The DoE was established in 1979.

By 1990, \~80% of Americans could read and write at the 6th grade level.

Today, that has dropped below 80% because:

1. we changed the definition of functional literacy to include digital media and more complicated text.

2. the gap between a good school and a ""good enough"" school has widen (especially in states that only require a ""minimally sufficient"" education)

This is a much higher level of literacy than most countries report.

It's also explicitly measured in *English* and measures all adults resident in the US. What has happened recently is that the immigrants coming into the US are more likely to speak English as a second language - a third of those with lower than 6th grade literacy are immigrants - and over time the proportion of non-english speakers in the US is going up, even for those born in the country. All this leads to the 6th grade measurement going down.

Miller says a reelected Trump intends to requisition National Guard troops from sympathetic Republican-controlled states and then deploy them into Democratic-run states whose governors refuse to cooperate with their deportation drive.
Such deployment of red-state forces into blue states, over the objections of their mayors and governors, would likely spark intense public protest and possibly even conflict with law-enforcement agencies under local control.”

If you read the article itself even Jared Polis the governor of Colorado and one of the two leaders of this Democratic Governor's group does not believe that rights would be eroded instantly. Rather, he articulated that they are setting up this group to create policies to protect their states prerogatives and remain vigilant.

The Insurrection act allows military to be called up for law enforcement duties in times of extreme civil disorder. 

Eisenhower did it during some civil rights protests. George HW Bush did it during the Rodney King riots in southern california. George W bush considered it in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina but declined because the Louisiana governor had not requested it. 

Trump wanted to do it during the George Floyd protests in Washington DC but the military refused stating they could not do so unless requested by the DC government.  

I can see that guardrail being gone and the military going along with it if he wants to call them up to quell a protest.

"This is why I'm talking about specifics.  I am not asking about a theoretical interpretation of the law and what's illegal and what's not. 

Ok, so Trump establishes some weird ""war council"" of retired senior military members who have authority to make recommendations on relieving generals of command who don't demonstrate leadership or whatever.   

Like I said, I'm not pretending it doesn't move the needle. The next time Trump wants to call up the military to suppress a major protest, maybe they don't refuse and you end up with soldiers in the Street. The last time that happened was 1992, but it could happen.   The Normal ROE for soldiers is WAY more restrictive than cops, but maybe even he tells them to shoot and no one stands up to them and we end up with a Kent State incident where protesters are shot by the US military.    That alone would echo for months. 

OP is positing something that is a whole order of magnitude different.  That Trump is simply going to order the military to go to the California governor's mansion, arrest Gavin Newsom, and take over the government of the state of California simply because he doesn't like Gavin Newsom. 

I stand by my prediction that's not going to happen.  If he did issue that order, it would probably be ignored.  If he forced the issue, it would probably involve relieving a whole chain of command until he got to someone who would do it, and it would split the US military right down the middle. Unless there's a huge backstory for justification and we've been in a constitutional crisis for months,  It would be a fort sumpter moment signaling the beginning of a shooting war.

"That is literally the political cycle starting from 2008. Economy gets wrecked, then Democrats fix it, Then voters toss out democrats, then republicans come and wreck it, then Democrats fix it. For whatever reason Democrats just can't seem to capitalize on their successes with voters and translate it into wins.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"The economy has some massive problems with wealth inequality regardless of how it looks on paper, and that's ultimately probably the biggest reason democrats lost. Republicans are about to make it so MUCH worse but it's the only explanation I can think of that makes any sense. Housing prices are unattainable and groceries are sky high from years of inflation.

But to Biden's credit, his administration did the best that can be expected in recovering from an unprecedented pandemic, one that was severely mismanaged by the prior administration. The incoming administration seems severely unqualified (appointments appear to be mostly nepotism) and the policies being proposed seem like they will lead to economic catastrophe. Large tariffs, reckless spending on tax cuts and deportations, likely cuts to the safety net and potentially healthcare... hard to say exactly what's coming policy-wise but it doesn't look good for the economy.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"I’m reminded of a quote from Futurama: “when you do things right, most people won’t know you’ve done anything at all.”

And the Biden administration did a great job getting inflation under control without causing a recession or driving up unemployment. BBB and inflation reduction act boosted blue collar manufacturing and construction jobs too. But life is still too expensive for many people and the massive amount of wealth generated in this country ends up in the hands of a very few. So the voters “felt” like Biden didn’t do anything at all to help them. 

I think the main problem is that government has done too much to protect the capital-owning class in this country and too little to help the working class. So the people are right to be upset at a “status quo” administration. Any establishment president (or VP) is voted out after 4 years.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

However, he also leaves him with a massively disaffected and unhappy population suffering from inflation and unaffordable housing. With massive government debt. With a stock market containing valuations that are rather astronomical. Even more so now after trump won.

A normal president who is also a decent human being could take this economy and make it work for everyone. Trump will take it, take credit for its current state, and punch down on anyone who is poor, brown, isolated, or in any other way vulnerable. He'll do what he was really brought in to do, which is making the rich richer, keep the poor poor, and distract everyone with culture wars while doing so.

"Trump isn't going to make it better, he's going to make it worse because he is a moron and his people are morons. However, Bidens economy was good in terms of unemployment, and inflation going down but there are important parts of the economy where his plans failed. In the past few months Biden bragged that he ""invested in American manufacturing to restore the backbone of our Nation: the middle class.” Yet most of the middle class—and the working class, for that matter—doesn’t work in manufacturing. Home prices, meanwhile, have risen 45 percent over the last four years, and nearly half of U.S. renters spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. Home insurance and mortgage rates are persistently high, and still-elevated interest rates have made car ownership—a necessity in most of the country—more expensive, too. Healthcare, childcare and college educations are wildly expensive, and can saddle people with six-figure debts for decades. 

These are things Kamala should've talked about when she was running. 

But again, 4 more years of Trump will make all of those things more expensive and probably cause a housing crisis and prices of products like cars will explode in price if he goes with his dumbass tariffs.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"I think the media makes a mistake by exaggerating the state of the economy, and I say this as a Harris voter. The economy is not doing very well for many people unless you have a lot of money in the stock market. Good economy means easy access to a dignified job that pays enough to live reasonably well on and have a little left over, which I am not seeing. However, I understand that the Biden administration did mostly the right things given the situation and the historic crises. 

There were several times in the past few years when I would see ""The economy is great!"" while I'm doing an MS in engineering and struggling to find work that isn't at an Amazon warehouse, and became very very bitter, almost to the point of voting Trump just to ""burn it down"". I have very little to no stock market investments and therefore to me it doesn't matter if it's at 30% returns or 1% returns. In the end my reasonable side prevailed, but I can understand why for some people it may not have, and they may have chosen to burn it down. More realistic messaging such as ""The economy is doing better and recovering, but it still isn't where it needs to be and Biden/Harris will continue to improve it"" would have been more effective I think.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

Thank you for saying this!! I really wish Biden and Dems were louder than trump and republicans as they worked on fixing the economy. Media is certainly to blame here but creating a circus would have been beneficial. Trump never stopped doing rallys even after he won the presidency in 2016.  Now we all (Trump haters and supporters) will have to deal with his craziness for God knows how long. This may not end in 4 years.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I know this will be unpopular here, but…

There were plenty of attacks on Trump and Republicans for a long time, since before January 6 and nonstop after. Voters on the fence had a lot of opportunities to see the damning facts against Trump. I mean for crying out loud he tried to usurp our democratic institutions. The media could’ve done a better job of it, but even Harris was calling Trump a fascist.

The bitter truth that so many don’t want to face is that Harris was never that popular and most people don’t care for identity politics or culture wars. They really don’t. I’m not saying that to belittle minorities, LGBTQ+ people, or non-Christians… it’s just that’s exactly why Trump’s fear mongering worked. I really don’t understand why the left is so stubborn about this. The right took complete advantage of this and won votes with a bunch of crooks.

I don’t know how people can say rhetoric needs to change yet not acknowledge that Americans are not liking the rhetoric they were using. Democrats need to understand who they are trying to court. If you want to take votes away from Republicans then you have to understand who votes for Republicans. And the crazy part is, they do understand because they demonize Republican voters constantly. 2016 and 2024 are almost indistinguishable. Way too confident in the polls. Way too confident in the assumption that Americans are not single-issue voters. Way too hopeful that spite doesn’t drive people to vote or not to vote. Way too complacent that the checks and balances are going to save us.

People are ignorant. The average person is not a scholar or poet. The average person doesn’t think about the past week, never mind years, or plan beyond the next couple of days, never mind years. The average person isn’t a saint that has no unfounded hate in their hearts. The average person will not discern that trying to tear down racist, sexist, and phobic institutions is not wholly targeting them for simply being white, male, Christian. The women on the right will feel defensive of their own.

The problem isn’t rhetoric. The problem is that democrats are too naive to accept that tribalism is alive and well in the modern world. The problem isn’t American. The problem is that Democrats think the grass is greener across the border/ocean. The problem isn’t convincing Americans they actually have good lives. The problem is Democrats thinking Americans will believe Republicans will make their lives worse. The economy is booming. Yet democrats lost the popular vote. That should tell you something about 72+ million voters out there who despite all the dangers of a Trump presidency and Republican control of government, voted red.

Stop underestimating the rubber band effect of progress. Reactionary politics thrive on the naivety of intellectuals. Even Americans fighting and dying to free slaves were racist against blacks. Even Americans who fought to be free from a monarchy tried to install a homegrown monarch after winning the Revolution. People hold onto anachronistic notions despite having every reason not to. Democrats will keep getting shocked until they accept that fact.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

Since the bill [has never passed the house](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9495/all-info), it can't have been returned by the senate. 

Here is a short explanation of suspension of the rules,  [from the Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60722):

>The Majority Leader of the House of Representatives announces bills that will be considered under suspension of the rules in that chamber. Under suspension, floor debate is limited, all floor amendments are prohibited, points of order against the bill are waived, and final passage requires a two-thirds majority vote.

Most legislation that passes the house is under a suspension of the rules these days.

I wouldn't necessarily assume that this bill can easily pass without suspending the rules.

"This is what we've been warned about, at least those of us who didn't just vote a demagogue back into office because...  *feelings*. This is the future that political junkies and analysts have been labeling a ""crisis of incompetence.""

Schedule F is an executive action that the Trump administration tried implementing towards the end of his previous term, It's also a major policy proposal included in Project 2025.

Schedule F, combined with a unitary executive and broad immunities granted to the president, which is all part of Trump's coalition's agenda, will grant Republicans the power to pave the way for their party to cripple the separation of powers and consolidate authority for the foreseeable future.

The goal is to eliminate the independence of most government agencies and put them under the direct control of the executive and the president. What these policies will do is give The Trump administration the authority to then install loyalists into positions of power within these agencies, and positions that were formerly reserved for non-partisan, knowledgeable staff and experts in their field.

Yes, part of the goal is to ""gut the administrative state,"" which is also sometimes called the fourth branch of government, but the other part involves taking what's left, dismantling our democratic system of checks and balances, and creating a government that serves the Republican party, consolidates power and installs king Trump at its head.

Hence, a ""crisis of incompetence.""

The unnerving part is that we don't just have Trump to worry about, we have his MAGA coalition to worry about, as they will certainly use this opportunity to exploit Trump, the useful idiot he is, to build what can only be conceived of as a one-party state. ""Limited government"" my ass. How about limited to Republicans... 

The Trump administration also seems to be preparing to create new agencies out of thin air, offering people like Elon Musk a role in these agencies.

From there, they will have the best opportunity they've had in decades to implement an extreme, far right platform backed by special/rich interests, right wing think tanks, dark money groups, Christian nationalists, far right jingoists, corporate powers with the same rights as American citizens, foreign autocrats, right wing power brokers, billionaires, xenophobes, conspiracy theorists, and in some cases, white supremacists.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

They fought against testing and quarantine, even though those are proven methods of containing infection.
They fought for ivermectin even though it doesn’t treat Covid, with lawsuits against doctors and hospitals that refuse to give it to patients upon request! 😂🤷‍♂️
They fought to minimize Covid as a cold even though it’s a neurotrophic virus that does terrible things to the brain, body and immune system that we don’t even fully understand. We have massive concerts that are superspreader events & music stars who are disabled with long Covid!

"Not just any pandemic, most likely “The Big One”.

On the upside most of the people the GOP plan to appoint, and the GOP themselves, don’t believe in masks, antibiotics, vaccines, or anything one would normally use to counter or increase immunity to a pathogen.  Also the type of natural healing they follow is more type of spirituality versus actual traditional “herbal medicine”; this is because they believe that traditional herbal medicine is witchcraft.

It should also be noted that quite a few of the people that are causing many problems right now believe they are protected by God or genetically superior to the point that “the big one” won’t harm them.  Thankfully disease does not discriminate or care about what you believe in.


Uncountable numbers of people will die, it will have a ripple effect across the globe.  Those who die in the largest quantities will be those who do not follow medical protocol for a pandemic, without a vaccine history, those who don’t believe in medicine, and those over the age  of 50 or who are immunocompromised or in general unhealthy.  If it’s a new pathogen, not even the wealthiest will be able to escape because there will be no treatment and there will be nowhere to hide from the microbial nightmare.


But hey, we might get our democracy back and a chance at an actually fair society, though it will be in the most horrifically traumatic way.

Also, here are some tips that you should start working on now before the public health department gets torn apart.

Stock up on anything that might help medicine or health wise during a pandemic before the administration gains power.  I’m stocking up on my actual vital medicine because I’m pretty sure it’s going to be restricted or banned.  

Grab as many PDFs and books as you can about surviving during a pandemic, doing things yourself, or any books you suspect might end up being banned very quickly.  Heck build a whole personal library if you can.  Download every single document you can from all of these departments that are going to be shut down, including all of the emergency guidelines.  Every single PDF possible.  Copy paste anything else or screenshot it.

Our basic municipalities might continue to survive, but there’s a pretty good chance other stuff will shut down completely.  

Convert that copy pasted or screenshot and pasted important information from online sources to PDFs on your phones or other devices and print out physical copies and put them in plastic sealed document holders.  If you can get yourself archival quality optical drives and readers back up everything you can on those. As long as you have power, you should be able to access those systems.  If you are tech savvy enough, get a raid system set up and build your own network that is off-line and is not connected to the Internet to store all the data you could potentially need.

This isn’t just due to potential pandemic related Internet outages and related problems, but censorship that will be coming with the new administration.  There is a very high chance that besides dismantling the health department and turning it into a faith-based healing network, the incoming administration will purge all vital documents that are available to the public about what to do during a pandemic, or any another type of health crisis or emergency.

Download everything you possibly can now.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"There is nothing worse than a bully, especially one with the mentality that seeks to prove that being a bully is a natural expression of being right and that everyone else is wrong. That might is right mentality is an outgrowth of the evolutionary principle contained in the notion of survival of the fittest. The very same principle that pushes people to believe in the of culling the herd for their own personal and financial benefit. Kurt Vonnegut said that artists are the canaries in the mines of society, the first of our citizens to know when the air of our society goes bad and as such the first to be arrested and bullied. This is certainly true in Russia and in other countries that arrest its citizens for reporting on crimes by the countries leadership. It is one thing to attack a government official with false accusations, another thing altogether to ask someone in power to explain in a reasonable way there lust for power, which is always hard to do. Ask a billionaire why they have the right to steal money, and the only answer they can give, is that it is a God-Given right. If you have read Project 2025, which few have you would be cowering under the table right now. It reads like a power grab of cult-like leaders using a Christian Mythology to control people as a way of increasing their own sense of self worth by abusing others. Humans are a vast and varied culture of individuals who instinctively want to trust others of their own kind. Bullies use the power of force, over the power of reason to enforce their views on others, enforcement that is always bought and paid for by laws put in place to control the population, removing the artist first, the scientist second. If the can't be bought, they are arrested or jailed.

Women, becoming pregnant is a perfect example of this system. If they can't be controlled financially or sexually by bullies, (aka men), they use pregnancy as a means of submission. It is why they are attacking abortion laws in our nation as a means of controlling women, natural childbirth is also cheaper than abortion, and you have a built in babysitter. Project 2025 is regressive in nature, a return to the cultural era's of the past when men were kings and women slaves. When white privilege meant just that you were white and privileged. Don't let them fool you. Already there are programs on National television, reality shows that celebrate wedding and girlfriend auctions. The Bachelor being the most popular. There are other variations of the same kinds of shows all of them sexualizing women who adore men. Project 2025 is all about in its simplest form white Christian men wanting to be adored. The picture the Guardian Post is a perfect example as is Trump.

"I am not a Trump supporter. 

That said, many Progressives have said that Democrats prefer to pander to the elite instead of the working class. I know Trump is part of the elite. But I’ve also seen moderates consistently lose elections because they love to pander to the corporate elites. There is a crisis going on that Democrats are unwilling to confront. We saw it with Hillary. She won the popular vote but lost the election. At first, people speculated that she had so many controversies, like Benghazi and her emails, that made her unpopular. But 2020 we flip script to Biden and he passes the Green New Deal. We go from that to Kamala Harris, whose most progressive idea was codifying abortion. We look back at Hillary and then at Kamala and say Kamala can win because she has no baggage. But she loses and we begin to think our enemy is women. Is it women? How many vocal MAGA women are there? There’s so many from Laura Loomer to MJT to Kristi Noem and we keep telling ourselves it’s sexism so that the Democrats can bring another Moderate to the table. And this time it will be a male and we will once again reassure ourselves that we learned from Kamala and Hillary and that a male candidate can win, thereby cementing our own prejudices. Let’s be real, the Democrats aren’t the elite, but they sure do want to be a part of it so bad. I know Trump has really twisted the word to weaponize it against Democrats.

But most importantly, I think moderates can’t win because they are unwilling to uproot the status quo. They’re okay with racism, sexism, antisemitism, homophobia in some parts of the country. Apparently we need to meet at the middle of tolerance and hate to get this country working. Apparently, we need to have some poverty so that the country can run smoothly and we need some election interference from authoritarian regimes. We also need the children of janitors to also become janitors. We also need to bolster the prison system to churn out more criminals, or else what would our police unions fight for? Why not use the National Institute of Health to find evidence-based criminal reform? Why not expand college access and make it cheaper and more affordable? Why not institute Social Media controls to control misinformation? And why not try to de-radicalize people through community-based interventions? 

I know Kamala probably would speak up against any of this. But her comments on Fox News when asked about immigration, they were horrible. She hinted that she too might support large-scale deportations, which end up costing money and bring more violent crime. We heard her stance during the debate, but she made sure to go out of her way to reiterate harsher words on a more radical platform. She really didn’t need to do that and it is nothing short of pandering. Moderates like to say that doing Progressive things will lead to predictably unfavorable outcomes, but Trump gets to pass so many controversial policies.

"What blue collar workers understand, that college educated Democrats do not apparently, as is readily evident by the posts that are made on this subject here constantly, is that their material interests are not the same. The material interests of someone who either works a 9/5 job, or on their own schedule, and who produces purely intellectual goods in order to have a middle class lifestyle, is very different than the material interests of someone who is working two jobs in the service industry to service those people, or someone who does backbreaking manual labor just to make survival wages. The latter people don't even have the mental bandwidth to spend on politics that the former do because so much of it is spent managing things like debt, making critical payments necessary to keep them from homelessness like rent, ect.

It isn't about vibes. The nibbling at the edges policies that Democrats have about creating 200 jobs specifically in Podunk, Nowhere aren't answering any big questions about the precariousness of their situation. The Democrats line that they must ""trust the experts"" rings hollow when they are the party of the experts and their livelihood depends on being trusted. That Democrats do not produce policies that challenge the mega rich and keep trying to make it seem like ""everyone wins"" from their policies only adds to the suspicion, because they once again know something that Democrats do not: There is always a winner and a loser. Because they aren't being told who the losers of the policies are, they assume -they- are the losers of the policies.

Trump came forward, and directly talked to the working class, as did Biden, and that is why they won their elections. Mind you, Trump's solution, radical tariffs, is a bad one, but he has clearly identified the winners (Those who need manufacturing brought back to the country) and the losers (China) to them. That's why they trust him, even though he is a liar and a con artist. Because, on this issue, the one that is the most important to them, he is being pretty forthright about what he thinks he will happen, who will win and loser, and has proposed a radical policy to address their problem. This is what Democrats need to actually learn from Trump. Not that they need to dump trans rights, start putting migrants in camps, or that they need to engage in gutter politics. They need to learn that there must be winners and losers of policies, and that they need to identify them clearly and aim for the working class to be the winners.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"Conservatives aren’t actually very conservative but people keep calling them that anyway. Do you know where “progressive” comes from, in American politics? It’s about 100 years old now. It used to include eugenics. 

The dictionary is a bad place to get your political definitions from. “Progressive” is just a word the media applies to democrats who are slightly less corporate than average, and it sounds good so people apply it to themselves.

“People are treated better,” sure. They could be treated even better, if Dems wanted things to be that way. And every time they lose an election, they start talking about how they should abandon the idea that people should be treated better because that’s too progressive",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"I didn't know that about eugenics.  I'm sure it was cutting edge ""science"" of the day and could be called a 'progressive' by the time idea.  But, the dictionary term, of desiring better still loosely applies in a directional way.   I would suggest that Republicans are culturally conservative in they are fighting change and a desire to conserve their cultural beliefs (how they were raised).  In general, I hear what you're saying about those voting with the Republicans might not be conservative, but we need to identify folks -- and it'd be great to have a shorthand.  What else should we call them?  They're not all Republicans.

It's a shame that for every election lost by the democrats there is a faction that thinks they need to abandon people being treated better.  I think that gets to a desire for that group to be in power and make evolutionary progress or prevent what they see as backsliding from a Republican administration.   As a strategy, I don't agree.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

If you don’t do the unethical thing that makes more money, your competitors will and then your company goes bankrupt as shareholders pull their capital. This is compounded by the fact the capitalist class necessitates a state to enforce property rights on their behalf, thus crafting laws where it becomes illegal to not engage in unethical profit seeking as that would break your “fiduciary responsibility” to your shareholders. Fascism, just like before in the 20th century, is nothing more than a reactionary response to late-stage capitalism.

"Thank you for the well thought out response and insight into you as an individual.

 Now, both red and blue are not what America needs. Red team only won because they shipped all the illegal immigrants to blue states to show the impact it has. I live on the Southern border and I have nothing but respect for the legal immigrants that followed the path to citizenship. They love this country.

The open border policy really opened my eyes to the illegal immigration policy. There is no vetting of good or bad, they all get more help than me (got my felony in early 2000s) or American citizens who have a clean record. Not to mention the disrespect and entitlement to our country is infuriating. If you’re brave enough to travel 3000 miles you are brave enough to make your home country a little better- they don’t.

The economic side of the Biden presidency was infuriating. The 2018 tax cuts that saw the middle class tax increase year after year and they saw it coming. 2 years with a fully blue house, senate and presidency and what was done to benefit the American people? Everyone but the middle class got help. His policies helped those with investments and stock holdings as that is where a majority of the recovery was seen- a lot of middle class did not feel that “economic boom”. I want help for veterans and mentally ill first. Reward the immigrants who did it properly. 

I and a lot of other Americans feel the same way- that’s why Kamala got Hillary’d- here message was for everyone but the backbone of this country. 

Also- we did not get a choice for Kamala. We were told we had to vote her. Reminds me of how Bernie got fucked by the DNC in 2016.

And I will be honest- I don’t watch a lot of cable news- it’s all propaganda to divide. I research all my opinions in a non bias manner.. or try to.

"I suggest you read *How Democracies Die*. Several democratically-elected leaders have dismantled the very systems that brought them to power (e.g. Chavez in Venezuela and Fujimori in Peru).

Here is a quote from the introduction:

>This is how we tend to think of democracies dying: at the hands of men with guns. During the Cold War, coups d’état accounted for nearly three out of every four democratic breakdowns. Democracies in Argentina, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Thailand, Turkey, and Uruguay all died this way. More recently, military coups toppled Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi in 2013 and Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. In all these cases, democracy dissolved in spectacular fashion, through military power and coercion.

>But there is another way to break a democracy. It is less dramatic but equally destructive. Democracies may die at the hands not of generals but of elected leaders—presidents or prime ministers who subvert the very process that brought them to power. Some of these leaders dismantle democracy quickly, as Hitler did in the wake of the 1933 Reichstag fire in Germany. More often, though, democracies erode slowly, in barely visible steps.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

If something is clearly off, then the insurrection act exists for reasons like this. Again, I do think its fishy but I recognize that could be just my shock and grief.

Who did your students vote for? Who did their parents vote for? 

I'm a Mexican woman and I have never seen such idiocy in my people. Mexican men have always been incredibly racist, so that was a no brainer there. I don't know of one Mexican man that voted for, or would ever vote for, a Black woman.  Then, they have this confidence wherein they think that trump wasn't talking about THEM. He was talking about those other Brown people. He won't come for THEM, or their family (some who are here illegally), or my kid was born here so they won't deport me and leave my kid all alone.

They also refuse to believe that we have a booming economy and that we have Biden to thank for that.  Nope, everything sucks...we're a garbage can like trump said tho the facts are the opposite.

White Christians are always the only ones who vote conservative. If you include them in any category, it makes that category seem like they prefer Trump.

e.g. women voted for Trump means white Christian women voted for Trump

Edit: look at all the white ppl rushing to downvote me so they can continue their propaganda to hate Muslims and brown ppl instead of blaming the majority of white Christian men and women who vote for Trump repeatedly",2024_11_14,05_43_09

So, I found the way Porter talked about her experience with her abusive ex and experience as a single mother ableist, sexist, classist, and alienating in a way that sadly matched the culture of Irvine and the school and erased folks like me who have to deal with ""women's issues"" but aren't women. Porter was also, according to interviews and second-hand accounts, abusive to her staff. That harms people. I am opposed to harm, especially harm that is discretely verifiable in its happening and impact.

I also support Min's work moreso, as a pragmatist and someone with a religious commitment to forwarding the cause of non-violence, above all else.

I find them both scummy. I find OC scummy, so, that is irrelevant. Affluence isn't virtue... and for all Porter's work, I felt she operated as if it was.

"The joke is only 12 percent of LGBT people in America voted for Donald Trump and it is LGBT people who are going to get screwed over the most 'cause Donald Trump plans on removing Anti-LGBTQ+ Discrimination Protection and without these protections from discrimination, housing, healthcare, education, employment, and federal government programs can legally discriminate against anyone LGBT – refusing people homes, jobs, and even medical procedures and worst of all LGBT people can be violently assaulted and if a homophobic Police Officer doesn't take it seriously the attacker will get away with it since the Police Officer is not legally obliged to. He also wants to introduce  LGBT Education Barriers across America which they have already started doing in Florida removing books with LGBT characters and figures in history, Teachers getting fired because of their sexuality, Teachers being told they will be fired if they talk about homosexuality with students during classes trying to force students to hide in closets with their sexuality and if a student gets bullied or harassed on the basis of their sexuality the student doing the bullying will not be punished.

This is sadly what life is going to look like for a lot of LGBT people in America and as a Lesbian who has LGBT friends living in your country I worry about their health and safety now because they live in a country now where their government hates them and wants to take away all their rights. It has already been reported there has been an increase in suicides and there have been more calls to suicide helplines from LGBT people since Donald Trump won the election than there has been ever before 'cause they are worried about what he plans on doing to them but of course, the people that voted for Trump don't give a crap about that because it is not their lives this is going to affect or their rights that are being taken away from them.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"Sanders was right [all the way back in 2003.](https://youtu.be/KtiRjnoYOPA)

If you're ostracizing various groups in the moment — whether that's Muslim, Jewish, Gay, Immigrant, Trans depending on the year and the expediency of Republican fearmongering — you're playing into the GOP hand and falling for the same trap over and over again.

What's next, run Hillary Clinton again only this time go to the right of Republicans?

Look, here are the problems:

- The rich and right-wing media ecosystem controls the vast majority of news & information and thus the narrative in this country.

- Republicans successfully divide the poor and middle-class against each other to keep us distracted.

- The Rich continue to increase their wealth.

- This leads to a feedback loop of people getting more outraged and pointing the finger at each other under cultural, racial, or sexist grounds.

- The only group capable of seeing through this game being played are the college educated.

- But Democratic messaging with non-educated working class voters is terrible and made harder by aforementioned media ecosystem.


The only solution to this right-wing populism that resonates with non-college working class is an equal-but-opposite reaction with progressive economic populism: **The Rich Are The Problem.** It's something the simplest, most illiterate can understand. Time to use fearmongering in the reverse direction. 

Combine this with utilizing the billion dollars raised by Democrats not to push ads that play into the Overton Window; not to have a million rallies repeating the same stale dial-tested buzzwords like ""Opportunity Economy,"" but actually piercing echo-chambers and educating Americans on myths, critical-thinking, history lessons.

So again, a one-two punch: (1) Point the finger at the rich, (2) While doing so, inject any bit of education you can to speak directly to the voter. Start persuading instead of letting the blind lead the blind.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

It's them who assign value to people based on their skin color, nationality or sexuality. Democrats just want everyone to be treated equally regardless of these differences.

I'm calling it. Kamala lost because of the media. Their owners are ultra rich psychopaths who couldn't care less about Trump's harmful policies, they liked his sweet tax cuts and they missed the revenue he brought to them.

Obama supported gays but he didn’t campaign on every agenda item they had.

But everyone knew he was pro gay and would fight for them.

He got elected and enacted pro-gay after pro-gay legislation until the gay community got basically everything on their agenda within his two terms.

People stayed home or they voted and did nothing more, or they voted downballot Dem and left the top blank or third-party. It made everyone mad and no one happy.

">He won in a massively red state without throwing trans people under the bus. How'd that work out for Allred in a much more competitive state?

Just clarifying because the language isn't clear and a lot of Dems legitimately don't understand the issue -

Allred made a very public point of throwing trans people under the bus. Never said a single thing in our favor, and fueled the Republican culture war about ""boys playing in girls sports""

Fueling Republican culture wars fucks EVERY SINGLE RACE, across the nation. You don't get to say we have a major crisis that the Republicans are right on and Democrats are wrong on, we're not in the 1930s where people only know their local politics if they follow politics at all. Saying Republicans are right makes Republican candidates everywhere stronger and Democratic candidates everywhere weaker. It makes people think Republicans are more authentic and Democrats change values on a dime.

Sherrod Brown did it too, and he lost what should have been an easily winnable race.

And Harris's only mention of trans rights this campaign was the weird, vague ""I will follow the law"" response that makes it sound like trans people are just fucked if they're in red states, the federal government is still going to do nothing to help while red states use laws to threaten arrests and bounties.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

No, Bernie isn't infallible. But he did play the game of the senior leadership in the party. He fell in line like a good Democrat this time around, and it utterly backfired. When do progressives get a chance at driving the ship instead of getting shot in the foot by their own DNC?

I really don't give a fuck who it is we run: Michelle Obama, Taylor Swift, Jon Stewart, George Clooney — Democrats need to wake the fuck up and realize that this is not a job interview but a popularity contest and that if we put someone who is actually charismatic at the top and speaks passionate from the heart instead of everything they say being dial-tested, we might actually have better results. Again, less ""Opportunity Economy"" and more, ""The rich are stealing everything from you. I'll fight to give you a bigger piece of the pie.""

Therefore, he reasons that Israel is entirely Justified in excluding them and requiring them to move back to their putative homelands.

"One bit of historical context, the in the Levant during Roman times, the Jews were almost wiped out by the Romans in reprisal to the bar Kochkba revolt.


The Christians, at that time, were a Jewish sect, but unique among Jewish sects because they prosletized to other neighboring peoples.


Many of which were closely related to Jews and shared the same common language, Aramaic.


So, after the Romans targeted the centers of Jewish influence in the region, the main survivors were the Christians in the surrounding areas.


Christianity was the main Religion in the region until the Islamic conquest, and Christian communities still hang on in the region.


Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities all exist in the region, and all three have considerable decent from original (i.e. Cannanite) populations, but the Christian communities for the most part are the only ones that have only descent from the original populations of the region.


Also, common misconception here is that Jews are not a Cannanite nation. They are. There is no other possibility given the linguistic and artifact evidence.


So, one specific Cannanite nation gets targeted by the Romans, after which the surrounding related Cannanite nations who were converting to Christianity fill in and then there is the Islamic conquest.


So, all this is to say, that in early medieval history this was a Christian region, and then it was subjected to conquest.


The crusades had enormous problems that overshadow any of the original motivation, but I think the initial impulse was to assist those Christians from what was perceived to be foreign invaders.


It could be that is still the same understanding here.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

So how can you not admit what israel is doing is horrible also. You are making false equivalnces. The difference between this is israel is dragging the us into this and using our weapons and tax dollars. I dont pay taxes to russia or china inpay them to the usa so when they use that money to aid and abide war crimes i am not okay with it. Israel has made their bed Hamas has asked for peace but israel refuses peace they want to commit genocide. Israel is the one currently committing the crimes hypotheticals have no place in a discussion of reality. So saying what i would want or not has nothing to do with this the fact is israel committing war crimes with my tax dollars and i do not approve and no one should. If israel wants to exist with their neighbors then they need to learn how to play nice and if they cannot stand on their 2 feet then that is on them and them alone.

">some sort of misdirection play... 

Sure. More 4D chess. 😂

Much of Trump's first cabinet was never confirmed.

I'm amazed that anyone, at this point, thinks Trump will use normal channels and procedures to rule. Did you see yesterday where he said he'll create a new department by executive order?",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Ding. Ding.

If the Senate gives up confirmation power that sets a precident.

Choosing John Thune over Rick Scott is a shot across the MAGA bow.

Confirmations/hearings are a large part of the Senate's responsibilities, plus they get to grandstand on TV.

They're not giving that up for Trump this time. They are already planning for a post-Trump future.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"this has been my hope since hearing about his election earlier today, that he just rescinds his promise and forces a hearing for everyone",2024_11_14,05_43_09

gabbard will get americans killed. gaetz will push for politically motivated sham trials.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
It really depends on your POV. What is worse the entire legal system of the US being controlled by a sex trafficker or a known foreign asset being in charge of the Intel apparatus. IMO the first one is worse because I more trust the Intel community to better respond to Intel leaks. Given that Gabbard is an idiot I would not be shocked if the Intel community just works completely independently and starts feeding her false info once leaks are noticed.,2024_11_14,05_43_09

"Look at the Thune’s position. If they don’t want to confirm Gaetz, Trump is going to make them go through with it. Gaetz ain’t withdrawing his nomination. 

So, are they going to have a hearing on live tv and show everyone Gaetz pays underage girls for sex? That’s the conversation they want to have, that men who prey on girls are unfit to serve in the government? Are they going to try to come up with some other phony reason? 

And right as Trump is riding high on the Republican trifecta victory, they want to shoot themselves in the foot? They have the senate majority. They’ll have to work hard to blame the Dems for this one",2024_11_14,05_43_09

I was thinking this.,2024_11_14,05_43_09

Also even republicans really fucking hate Gaetz.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"There is very little Trump is good at, but forcing his opponents into lose-lose scenarios is a technique he has mastered.  Trump will use the selection of Thune and the Senates attempt to deny Trump recess appointments as an attack against MAGA, the voters, the “mandate” he claims to have. He will attack Senate traditionalists as never Trumpers, and Deep Staters.  It is the same strategy he used to avoid accountability for his multiple criminal cases.  Attack the prosecutors, attack the Judges, attack the system. For Trump, causing chaos and undermining the system is the goal. He plays by different rules because he has a different agenda. He isn’t trying to install a functioning democratic government",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"He never made a promise in the first place, to be fair - just a vague tweet that said recess appointments could be 'on the table'",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"Yes. But, and not to be insensitive, but would that be worse than the million people Trump killed during his first term?

Has RFK actually been named to that post? Or any post? He wants it, but my impression is that Trump hates him almost as much as I do.

"Generally speaking, whether someone voted to confirm a Presidential appointment probably doesn’t move the needle too much on the campaign trail. It feels a little too in the weeds compared to the macro ‘how are you feeling about the direction of the country issues’ that most people vote on.

Pregnant women are pretty much sacrifices / offerings to their fetus idol.

There are plenty of Christians who don't buy in their doctrines.

They insist that nonviable fetus are people and everyone subscribes to their belief. I personally don't think fetus are people. They are potential people. They will never be people without pregnant women. It's just like seeds are not plants. They have to resort to some sort of soul concept to make their belief fathomable.

They also glorify fetus. If fetus were people, they are some of the most violent people. They cause pregnant women sick. They even kill some of the pregnant women. Babies may be innocent, but fetus are not.

Mr Ramaswamy — whose catchphrase has become “shut it down!” — said on the campaign trail that he also wants a crusade against big government at the Department of Education, the Internal Revenue Service, and foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

His views, expressed as [a loyal surrogate for Mr Trump in the run up to the election](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/13/trump-transition-team-vetting-applicants-one-condition/), may be at the extreme end of what is possible at the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Indeed, shutting down an entire federal agency would likely require congressional approval.

But Mr Ramaswamy will at least now have the power to shape the priorities of the new department, which has been built from scratch to cut red tape and bureaucracy in as little as two years.

The new agency will operate outside of government and provide recommendations to the White House on how to slash regulation and [cut huge chunks from the almost $7 trillion federal budget](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/13/elon-musk-plan-slash-waste-prove-left-humiliatingly-wrong/).

It was [the brainchild of Mr Musk,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/13/the-daily-t-youre-hired-why-trump-gave-elon-musk-a-top-job/) the tech billionaire who has become one of Mr Trump’s closest advisers, who had been pitching the idea of a cost-cutting commission on the campaign trail.

The president-elect has given the two men, who he described as “two formidable Americans”, until July 4, 2026 — the 250th anniversary of Independence Day — to deliver a report containing their findings.

In his announcement, Mr Trump said the body [would drive “drastic change”](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/11/10/elon-musk-public-sector-revolution/) by making proposals on “large scale structural reform”. The recommendations would push the government to take a more “entrepreneurial approach” by focusing on federal bureaucracies and agencies, as well as slashing red tape and spending.

Mr Trump has already said he wants to abolish the Department of Education, and leave states in control of schooling, and to decimate what he terms the “deep state” – career federal employees he says are clandestinely pursuing their own agendas.

Generally speaking, large budgetary actions are the remit of Congress. They can take advice from outside panels like the proposed efficiency panel, or disregard it. This may clash with Mr Ramaswamy’s claims he can shut down departments using executive orders through Mr Trump.

In an effort to be transparent, Musk has said DOGE will post its “actions” for public comment.

Bush and tried to appoint Merrick Garland, a conservative justice to the supreme Court. Obama promised to codify Roe V Wade into law, and didn't even try. He campaigned on Medicare for all and gave you Mitt Romney Care, which was written by the heritage foundation? I am asking only about laws passed or attempted to be passed, not rhetoric. I'll give democrats credit for trying and failing. Biden's big infrastructure bill was a great bill.

"Fact: I voted for Harris. Fact: Since Biden took office, overall employment is up 12%, average pay is up 19% and unemployment is down from 6.7% to 4.1%. Fact: Republicans won the messaging war on the economy by shouting ""inflation"" constantly, while the Democrats failed to make a compelling point for the actual decent job Biden did. Fact: Harris lost this election. And it's my fault for pointing out why? Let me propose you a question. Does it even matter how good of a job the democrats do in office if they end up losing afterwards anyway because they can't make their points effectively? And, to get back to the original point. Your best argument for how democrats are different from Republicans is gay rights. Unlike abortions, democrats actually did something. I believe in both, gay rights and abortion access. But does it really matter if the democratic party ""claims"" to be in support of abortion rights if they're really not trying? Go ahead and defend the party for not protecting women's rights. Nancy Pelosi helped fundraise for a pro life democrat in a primary because she wanted so badly to defeat a Bernie style democrat running in that same primary. The safer communities act was BIPARTISAN. Introduced by a Republican. You're making my own point for me. I say, the parties aren't that different, and you point me to legislation supported by both parties? Does the democratic party pay you to do this nonsense? It wouldn't be their worst financial decision. You're more likely to change a voter's mind than Harris's face on the last Vegas bubble.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Then Biden should try to codify Roe V Wade into law, and when it fails because Republicans blocked it, use that issue to help win the election?? Many swing states that went for trump also passed abortion protections?? Explain to me how Biden doing nothing is better than looking strong and fighting? Abortion rights are a winning issue.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Look, I’m going to keep this very simple. I’m a gay dude who is only able to tie his shoes because of meds I receive through the ACA. The dems should have tried harder on abortion, I agree. Nancy Pelosi should stay out of primaries, yes. But when Trump’s new Supreme Court picks inevitably repeal Obergefell, when the republicans in congress dismantle the ACA and my joints turn to cement because I can no longer afford meds, I’m not going to care that a couple republicans voted for the dem’s gun bill. I’m going to feel the first hand effects of the parties not being the same. I’m going to suffer for it. I won’t be spared. I sincerely hope you are spared, but I also hope you remember people like me the next time you claim the parties aren’t that different.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I'm not an expert by any means, but don't these bills start in the House or the Senate? Biden can propose the bill to the House, but the GOP has control there. He can propose it to the Senate, but the lead given by the VP isn't enough to get it through there...

Are you saying Biden should write the bill?",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Abortion was a distant concern for voters. People thought Republican women would come out to vote for Biden because of abortion, but they split voted for Trump and the pro abortion ballot measure, thinking they were getting the best of both worlds. Meanwhile Democrats just stayed home. More messaging about how hard they were trying and failing wouldn’t have changed anything.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"You make a strong point about homosexuality being a differentiating issue.
But, let me ask you two questions.
One, who do you trust more to protect your rights as a homosexual? Bernie Sanders or Nancy Pelosi? Katie Porter or Joe Manchin?
If I had my way, the democratic party's support for gay rights would be at it's weakest point right now, and would only get stronger. I am not arguing on behalf of Republicans. I think Pelosi choosing to kneecap progressives over protecting abortion rights is telling.
That could be you. Nancy Pelosi could help fundraise for an anti gay Democrat just so she could defeat a Bernie style Democrat. The only reason that hasn't happened is because that specific situation hasn't happened to arise.
Two, do you think people in the country who aren't affected by gay rights are able to see significant differences in the two parties? It's not my fault, the democrats need to differentiate themselves better. Both legislatively and on television. I want the differences in the parties to be more significant. The point you just made to me was more powerful than, would you say, any point Harris has made during her presidential run?
Should we allow the democratic party to continue delivering you these losses? I genuinely believe Harris could have done better in this election, and perhaps even won.
Why shouldn't I blame her for doing less than her best? For filling her circle with bad advice from bad advisors that contributed to her loss?",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"71% of independents support gay marriage. In 2024. Do you believe Harris would have done better or worse in the election if she had talked about gay marriage, for example? The whole point of my argument is that the lack of differences between the parties is due to democrats failing to differentiate themselves successfully. Harris could have made the supreme Court repealing gay marriage, or something like that, a key part of her campaign. Obama campaigned on codifying Roe V Wade when it was still upheld by the court. Obama won. Harris could have argued something similar about gay marriage.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I simply said that he should ""try to codify Roe V Wade."" Just try!! I did not speak to the legal process by which he might try. If you are trying to catch me in some error instead of responding to the intent of my point, then you are operating in bad faith.
My state went for Trump 52 to 46.
My state passed an abortion amendment to the state constitution 61 to 38.
Look me in the eyes and tell me it's a good thing democrats didn't push harder on the abortion issue.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"You make a fair point that abortion wasn't the number one issue. But, democrats could have brought it up higher on the list of issues if they wanted?
How can you say it wouldn't have changed anything? Democrats shouldn't frame it as ""we tried and lost."" They should frame it as, ""Republicans blocked abortion rights. Give us a majority next time and we will pass it."" The credibility being derrived from their previous attempt. Put republicans on the record voting against it so democratic congressmen have an easier time defeating Republican incumbents!
On the presidential level, keep suggesting Republicans want an abortion ban, and cite every possible example that backs up your argument. Even if an abortion ban isn't likely, make people think it's more likely by constantly pointing out all the evidence that Republicans want it.
The parties and the media have so much control, to some extent they can pick which concerns are the top concerns. Pick something you're winning on and talk about it constantly. Republicans are better at that generally.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

You may have valid concerns about Pelosi, but she has always been an advocate for LGBT people.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"""Chuck Johnson, an alt-right activist who Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz controversially invited to a January 2018 State of the Union address, is the likely source of a dark money bitcoin contribution to a pro-Gaetz super PAC.

Gaetz previously distanced himself from Johnson after drawing criticism from the Anti-defamation League and the Republican Jewish Coalition, both of which identify Johnson as a holocaust denier.

Johnson wrote in a Reddit Q&A that he has “never believed the six million figure,” and supports claims from Holocaust deniers “about Auschwitz and the gas chambers not being real.” He has since claimed that his comments were actually part of an experiment to test the site’s “commitments to free speech against fake hate speech.”

For his part, Gaetz has resisted calls from the Republican Jewish Caucus to label Johnson a holocaust denier, insisting that the alt-right figure is simply a “provoker.”

In May 2018, a company linked to Johnson made a $25,000 bitcoin contribution to Florida Conservative Fund, a super PAC that spent at least $44,700 in support of Gaetz's reelection campaign. 

While the committee is a single-candidate super PAC — it exclusively spent in support of Gaetz — it isn't formally associated with Gaetz's campaign, and the two are not allowed to coordinate with each other under FEC regulations.
The contribution was attributed to ""Castar Capital,"" a since-dissolved limited liability company formed in Wyoming. Public filings list Johnson as the company's CEO and its address as a mailbox rental in a shipping store.

Public information on Castar is scant, but a graphic design advertisement for Castar Capital lists chuckwalla1022 — Johnson's former Twitter handle — as its author (Twitter banned Johnson in 2015 after he threatened to ""take out"" a Black Lives Matter activist.)

The ad specifies that the author and a business partner ""run one of the larger bitcoin mining companies in the US."" The central Washington address Castar provided was formerly leased to HashPlex, LLC, a company that operated data Centers for Bitcoin miners.""

"What he’s proposing (forcing teachers to present a chauvinistic view of history, making kids pray) is impossible. Most teachers and administrators will refuse and he doesn’t have anything close to the political authority to do it.

What is trying to do here (and it will probably work) is to keep Americans focused on bullshit debates about whether or not “the Founders” were racist (news flash, everyone was racist in 1787) so they don’t focus their energy on skyrocketing prices and shit jobs with no benefits.

In it, the average change of math outcomes between 2019 and 2022, for example, had a loss of 0.154 standard deviations. But between 2022 and 2023, the outcomes saw a gain of 0.046 standard deviations, reclaiming about a third of the loss so far. 2023 - 2024 is also expected to gain, overall.

Edit: Just to add context, this report does claim that recovery has been expensive and time consuming for students, parents, and teachers/schools. The gain is despite the fact that the government didn't spend nearly enough to give everyone the resources to recover. Hence, traditionally lower income areas are still slow to recover, if they are recovering at all.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

"Polymarket and similar election prediction markets were the only places that accurately predicted the Trump sweep. Meanwhile, university and newspaper polls heavily downplayed the most important issue in the election, the Gaza genocide. It could have just been incompetence, but biased university and newspaper polls are a great way for wealthy donors/owners to mislead the general population.

On the other hand, traders have to risk their own money to bet on prediction markets. Corporations, hedge funds, and similar institutions pay for their own unbiased internal polling, and then make their bets in financial markets. Polymarket’s odds closely reflected the performance of the “Trump trade” and “Harris trade” on Wall Street.

Polymarket is still very small and new. Half a dozen “whales” heavily influenced the election odds on the site. Still, if the real odds were closer to 50/50 like the university and newspaper polls said instead of 66% Trump and 33% Harris like the prediction markets said, then it was an extremely easy arbitrage opportunity for traders. The fact nobody bothered to bet on Harris shows how awful her chances of winning were.

Harris did well in the prediction markets until Netanyahu started escalating the Gaza genocide in late September. After that, her odds of winning plummeted. Causation is not the same as correlation, but this was the only issue that tightly correlated with her prediction market odds.

"> There’s literally no way to be 100% certain about that. 

Yes, there's no way to be 100% certain. But it's the only issue that correlates with Harris's prediction market odds so closely.

> Only 4% of voters said foreign policy was their primary concern.

Yes, but that's based on exit polls of voters. It's the primary concern of once reliably blue non-voters. Framing the Gaza genocide as part of ""foreign policy"" is one of the ways university and newspaper polls downplayed the importance of Gaza (purposefully or mistakenly.)

> Do you think there could have been any sexism that suppressed turn out? 

No, I don't think so. If Harris kept her pre-DNC poll numbers, she would have won in a landslide. It wasn't until after she doubled down on Biden's support for Israel that her support started to plummet. I think the Democrats would be wise to nominate another woman in 2028.

> Racism? 

Same thing. I think Harris's race benefited her this year. If an old white man like Biden was the nominee, he would have lost by even more than Harris did. Keep in mind that Biden and Harris's policy positions were nearly identical. So we can control for that and consider their poll numbers as mainly based on their sex/race/age.

> Inflation that turned people off of incumbents? 

I don't think that mattered as much as people think. The stock market has been zooming upward under Biden for several years in a row. I honestly don't think Biden is responsible for the inflation we've seen and most Democratic and Republican economists agree. Usually voters blame whoever is in the White House for the economy no matter whose fault it is, but I don't think that applies to the 10 million Biden 2020 voters who didn't back Harris this year.

> Anecdotally, I’ve had multiple people tell me they voted for Trump bc of the “woke” policies of Biden/Harris. 

That makes sense to me. Woke is an ill defined word, but it does help explain why Joe Rogan, who endorsed Bernie Sanders in the past and described himself as a leftist/liberal, ended up endorsing Trump. I think Elon Musk switched from always voting for Democrats to supporting Trump because Biden screwed Tesla over to prop up $50,000 gas guzzling SUVs made by Ford, GM, Chrysler, and the United Autoworkers.

> Just bc Gaza was a big issue for you or your friends doesn’t mean it was the #1 issue for voters.

Yes, that's true. That's why I said it was anecdotal evidence. That being said, I do think I'm the canary in the coal mine here. I'm an atheist neoliberal in a swing state with no personal/ancestral connection to the Middle East. I phonebanked for Biden in 2020, was a big fan of Harris, and I never paid any attention to Israel or Palestine until a few months ago. Now it's the single biggest issue for me. Once Biden and Harris backed Israel's clear cut genocide, they lost all moral credibility. 

My personal feelings about Biden and Harris were closely reflected by the decline in her Polymarket odds. I felt confident enough about Trump sweeping the election that I made a huge bet on the Trump trade (via stocks, not event contracts on Polymarket or wherever). The trade paid off handsomely. I wasn't shocked or angry when Harris lost because I had already grieved a month or two ago, and made a plan going forward. 

In a weird way, I've never been more proud of the Democratic base or optimistic about the future of the party. The most marginalized groups in America were the ones that least backed Harris. Everyone could have sacrificed the people of Palestine, but instead decided that we'd all rather suffer together under Trump than leave anyone behind.",2024_11_14,05_43_09

We have a bunch of outlets that fund what they call journalistic enterprises, but none of them are able to call a spade a spade. There is this endless, miserly determination to frame the goings on in American politics as inherently legitimate, regardless of how broken or obscene it is, and that's editorial slant; the frame is always, ""There are no bad ideas and we must distantly intellectualize everything."" The moral character of our political media has become so unmoored from anything we might have recognized twenty years ago, and the media departments that report on this transformation have literally just allowed it to happen. There is no Fourth Estate, there is no apparatus in the media holding literally anyone or anything  accountable. We have the media equivalent of the seagulls from Finding Nemo, just chattering away with no predilection for a moral center.

Wrong. Race is protected. Being a fucking piece of shit is not,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Black people aren't ideologically the same. But people with Trump signs could be. They had a poor image of FEMA and repeatedly threatened them.

I don't think they should have skipped any homes, but this analogy is poor.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"No.  1 person isn't a pattern.  When it happens several times and there is documented cases of it, that's a pattern.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
">On previous deployments, Washington said she has told her team to avoid any streets where multiple homes had been verbally abusive to FEMA canvassers — including properties that featured signs for the Harris campaign, and homes with no signage at all.

So they'd skip a street with more than one hostile house, but we don't know how many more than one or how many houses per street.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"She said in an interview that they would skip blocks where they were met with any resistance and they had done it with people with Harris signs and no signs at all. Pretty shitty that your neighbor could be the determining factor of getting help, but then again people also made whole militias to hunt down FEMA workers. We should be mad at the lunatics who made it unsafe for FEMA workers to do their job vs the workers trying to do their job safely.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"It's funny to me how the people in this sub preach tolerance but want Republicans to never get any aid. I guarantee when Trump refuses aide to Democrats they will be complaining up a storm.

All for me, none for you in action.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Bingo,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Voting for someone you don't like isn't being a piece of shit. Once again. These aren't the people threatening them.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Do you think every Trump voters has the same beliefs.

It's a two party system.

Also refusing aide because of someone's political beliefs is abhorrent.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
So if it's three black people then it would be ok with you.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"So once again. Those people who didn't threaten people don't deserve aide because of where they live?

The party of tolerance in action.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Because republican politicians are constantly trying to gut infrastructure and emergency funding. It’s frustrating when the same people crying government waste hold their hands out for federal dollars.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"> These aren't the people threatening them.

False.  Trump riled them up and they were hunting FEMA


> Donald Trump’s baseless attacks against federal relief efforts for Hurricane Helene came to life over the weekend, when officials in North Carolina reported encountering truckloads of militia members “out hunting FEMA.”

> An official with the U.S. Forest Service, which is assisting in relief efforts in North Carolina, sent several federal agencies an urgent warning Saturday afternoon, according to The Washington Post.

Anyone who voted for trump last week is a piece of shit.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
The type of person to put a Trump sign in their lawn is the type to threaten FEMA workers. Not all Trump voters had signs.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"I said I don't think they should have skipped any homes or refused any aid. I only had a complaint about your analogy.

I also don't think Trump voters have the same beliefs, I only said that they COULD have the same beliefs and it's easier to believe than saying all black people would all attack FEMA simply because they are black.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"If I had dozens of cases like she claimed and I was getting deaths threats saying they were going to lynch me or that they were going to hunt me... 100% I would avoid those homes and tell my people to avoid those homes.

"I don't know, dude, you asked a question that was answered in the article so I posted the relevant part of the article for you. If you want to argue *opinions* about the incident, you'll have to argue them with someone else, since I don't have enough facts yet to form a strong opinion beyond ""the whole thing sounds pretty fucky and I hope we get a thorough investigation into it sooner rather than later.""

Enjoy the rest of your day.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
And it's funny the same people that preach equality outwardly refuse aid to people who don't vote their way,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Once again. Were these homes the exact people threatening them. There is no evidence of that.,2024_11_14,05_43_09

"As much evidence as the claim that FEMA skipped homes, anecdotal.  That is enough evidence for you chuckle fucks when corroborating the news you WANT to hear, why is it not enough for news that you dislike?  Sure sounds hypocritical.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
">Were these homes the exact people threatening them. 

Same group. If a bunch of Trump supporters are going around attacking FEMA workers, then not going to houses that are obviously Trump supporters isn't a wild leap of logic.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Less than half of America votes.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Do i need to repeat myself?,2024_11_14,05_43_09
I think someone who has a trump sign up listens to what Trump says and agrees with him.  So if Trump lies and bad mouths FEMA for 6 days straight that leads to his supporters hunting down their members then...yeah,2024_11_14,05_43_09
I mostly just think people shouldn’t be threatening FEMA workers 🤷🏼‍♀️,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Like when he denied FEMA relief to California or Puerto Rico under his 1st term?,2024_11_14,05_43_09
God bless those that did. For 45 47.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
In a two party system you are forced to vote against your beliefs because there are only two options and you have to prioritize platform and spefically only a small segment of issues that separate one party from the other for you. Most often that will be economic,2024_11_14,05_43_09
"Nope, the stupidity was obvious the first time.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
Correct. those people should be prosecuted. Once again. Do you think every home skipped was threatening FEMA workers.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
Correct. Except this time it will be only registered democratic voters and that'll be ok based on this precedent.,2024_11_14,05_43_09

You can't.  Because it never happened.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
"If that's the difference of whether or not you eat than yes. That vote would make sense. Keep in mind nearly half of women voted for Trump. Trump made massive gains with minority voters.

In an ideal world we would have more than two parties.",2024_11_14,05_43_09
The party of tolerance everyone. People like you make me embarrassed to be a registered Democrat. Maybe try to understand them if you actually want their votes in the future that we need.,2024_11_14,05_43_09
