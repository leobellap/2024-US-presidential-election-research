But to not see any major problem now with this Attorney General pick.

What a way to degrade the morals of the presidency and America. What a way to destroy the respect for the law.

OK, you can imagine you're going to keep order by sheer force so it will overcome the corrosive effects of Attorneys General who sleep with high school students. That is going to be quite difficult if everyone simultaneously loses their respect for the law. Medieval societies, where they used a lot of brute force, still had a much higher crime rate than anything we know. And a lack of respect for society, just makes it worse.

I think there's gonna be more crime and kids are gonna be less safe under a Trump administration.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"Here's what's going to happen.  During the confirmation hearings there will be questions for this young woman, that she will answer with aplomb and grace in front of the world, televised for all to see.  There will be questions for the witnesses about the event.  Again, presented on television for everyone to watch.  We will see Senators shaking their heads at her, and her testimony.  We will see Senators appear to be sympathetic to her.  We will even see Senators trying to twist it so that she is to blame for what happened.

Comedy news shows will make fun of all of the Senators dumbfounded expressions and stupid questions.  They will point out the hypocrisy of the Senators who have *also* been caught diddling people that are not their spouses.  Talking head news shows will have analysts on making grand statements about what the testimony means, about what the law is supposed to prevent, how damaging it is to Gaetz and Trump.

But then he will be confirmed by a majority of the Senate, with every Democrat voting against him, and only a handful of Republicans joining them.

How do I know this?

 In my opinion, old guard red state Senators and congress-critters will also check and balance Trump's overreach on social security, etc. Now that he's not chronically running for re-election (with maga controlling everything) I think a few of the old schoolers who probably hated trump all along (but rode the maga wave with him), will probably join Dems in putting the stops on some stuff, just to spite the guy who's been hijacking them for the past 9 years.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"Based on what I've read and looked into here is the deal with the criminal case. 

There were two major flaws with the criminal case that would have made proving sex trafficking difficult. If I was the prosecutor on the case I would have been really apprehensive about my chances at trial.  

To prove sex trafficking you have to prove that the defendant transported someone under 18 across state lines for the purpose of sexual intercourse or sexual contact.

1.  The victim on the case was apparently uncooperative and unwilling to voluntarily testify in any charge against Gaetz.  Pulling details out of an uncooperative victim in front of a jury is difficult and there was little telling what they will say on Cross examination.

2. The proof that Matt Gaetz paid for the sexual contact was a venmo payment to Joel Greenberg, a former elected tax collector for Seminole County florida.   Greenberg is a friend of Geatz and was the informant to the FBI on the case. However, Joel Greenberg is a convicted felon. More importantly, Joel Greenberg plead guilty to attempting to frame a political opponent and set them up based on allegations they were having sex with a minor.  

Sure, there is some hard evidence in terms of a financial transaction.  But if a defendant is going to argue that they are being framed as part of a political Vendetta, the victim is going to say that they were compelled to testify against their will and the state's main Witness has previously been charged with attempting to frame someone for the same crime, you've got a trial problem, when the defense only has to convince one juror to be steadfast that Reasonable Doubt exists.

"Boston Tea Party wasn't just a tariff, and it's frustrating to see people continue to grossly oversimplify that narrative.  

The actual story of the Boston Tea Party is the story of the Stamp Act.  And the Stamp Act was not a simple tax.  It was an enforced monopoly being presented as a mere tax.  The actual effect of the law was to ban all tea suppliers apart from the one that was state sanctioned, and that the supply through that one vendor would have a steep tax on it.  Pun unintended.  The applied result was going to be vast military crackdowns on what used to be just regular tea now being considered black market tea.  

It's hard to even imagine a similar story that could plausibly be put out in modern terms, because commodity monopolies are so difficult to set up in the modern world.  It might be along the lines of if the government somehow said that you could only buy crude oil from Exxon, and buying from any other vendor - including setting up your own drill - would be a felony.  It's hard for the modern mind to even imagine how that would work.  How would such a thing be policed, except for through the growth of a police state around it?  And that is exactly what the stamp act represented.  Not a mere tax, but a police state being put out under the guise of a simple tax.  

That is why it was such a big deal at the time and got a reaction that was wildly disproportionate to any of the many prior tax bills that were merely frustrating.  The Stamp Act was a radical bit of government control over commerce, well beyond what anyone in the colonies had ever seen before.

They are to determine if they will face sanctions (and possible expulsion?) from congress in addition to whatever other consequences they’re facing in court. The only time a congressperson would only have an ethics investigation and no criminal investigation would be if the accusation isn’t criminal in nature, like they were going to do with Al Franken before he resigned.  

Also, if you’re interested, there was a criminal investigation by the DOJ that wasn’t able to go anywhere because the victim was very uncooperative and the witness that was the go-between for the payments had threatened to accuse a political enemy of the same thing he was accusing Gaetz of, which means it would be difficult to convince a jury that he isn’t lying about Gaetz even though he was lying about the other guy.

As a pendant, not a tattoo, but I don't have any tattoos to begin with (yet). 

Pinoy, raised Catholic, but I've been out of communion so long I simply identify as non-denominational Christian.

I move around too much, and rather my acts of charity be spontaneous, not some tin cup rattling tithe I have come to notice is prevalent in America as compared to what I experienced as a child in the Philippines and the alms plate.

I've loved that specific cross since seeing it in childhood, a cross amidst crosses, personally to me it represents Christ amongst the faithful. I noticed it first on the flag of Georgia, and then discovering it as the crest of the former Kingdom of Jerusalem.

The furthest I've thought about taking my faith is joining an order and undergoing a pilgrimage to the Holy Land along the way. Life is still too busy, I'll probably be retirement age before my life slows down enough to achieve those goals, but they're still on my bucket list.

How the hell is that specific cross Nazi?

Its not the Teutonic Cross that was the basis for the Iron Cross, and its subsequent perversion.

* **Christ and the Evangelists**The large cross represents Christ, and the four smaller crosses represent the Evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
* **Spread of Christianity**The cross symbolizes the spread of Christianity from the Holy Land to the world.
* **Wounds of Christ**The five crosses represent the five wounds of Christ, with the four smaller crosses representing the wounds on his hands and feet, and the large cross representing the wound on his heart. 

The Jerusalem cross was first used in 1099 as the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, after the First Crusade recaptured Jerusalem and the Christian Holy Land. Pope Urban II gave the cross to the crusaders in the Middle Ages, and it became a symbol of pilgrims. The Jerusalem cross is a symbol of faith for many people, and is worn for protection. It's also sold as jewelry in souvenir shops. In the past, pilgrims would get a tattoo of the Jerusalem cross to prove they had traveled to the Holy Land. ",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Im so glad someone has said this. People are free to shit on the guy all they want, not going to argue with that, but the Jerusalem cross (the chest tattoo) is absolutely not a nazi symbol, infact it's quite the opposite. 

It's quite religious, but historically, if you want to talk about when Nazism was at it's peak (WW2), during this time it actually served as a direct counter symbol to the swastika, and also the communist hammer and sickle. 

As someone else has pointed out, there is another tattoo which is again extremely religious, and there's a loose historical link to the crusades with that one. The rest are just religious.

There aren't any nazi tattoos though, just extremely religious/Christian. The headlines are lazy. Switching nazi tattoos with Christian fundamentalist tattoos would be a much more accurate description.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"Doesn’t pass the sniff test. If it was actually a Nazi symbol, he wouldn’t be doubling down on it and showing it off. He’d be trying to hide it while he’s in the public eye. The fact that he made a story of this indicates that he thinks the tattoo is harmless and that he’s being treated unfairly, perhaps even “persecuted” for his Christian beliefs.

Unfortunately, all we have is his story that some unknown friend of his is 99.9% sure that he was removed from the inauguration detail because of his tattoo. That may not be the actual reason at all. Maybe it’s because of some dumb shit he’s tweeted.

Anyway, the point is that this is really flimsy evidence to hang “the US military disagrees with you” on. If there’s actual discussion of this being a hate symbol by a respectable group such as SPLC, then that’s another story.

"The Postillon, the German equivalent to The Onion, just published an article saying “Trump puts P Diddy in charge of women’s relations” :D

https://www.der-postillon.com/2024/11/trump-diddy.html

It’s in German, but here’s a translation:

Washington (dpo) - Donald Trump is causing a national and international stir with his cabinet appointments. Now another controversial appointment is making the rounds: Sean Combs, also known as P. Diddy or Puff Daddy, is to become the government’s Commissioner for Women’s Issues.

“Diddy knows women like no other,” reads a statement from Donald Trump. “He is excellent at organizing women when they are needed. He also has great social skills and treats women with the respect they deserve.”

The future president does not see the fact that P. Diddy is currently still in legal trouble because he is accused of human trafficking, rape, blackmail and drug abuse as a problem. “This is a classic conspiracy by the woke fakenews media,” said Trump. “My future Attorney General Matt Gaetz will see to it that this is dropped.”

As satisfied as Trump sounds now: According to insiders, Combs was only his third choice. Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein had previously been approached for the post. However, the former turned out to be dead, while the latter had to decline for health reasons.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"Anchoring bias is a cognitive phenomenon where individuals rely heavily on the first piece of information they receive—the ""anchor""—when making decisions. This initial information sets a reference point that influences subsequent judgments, often leading to skewed perceptions. 

In the context of political appointments, such as the nomination of Matt Gaetz for Attorney General, this bias can be strategically utilized. By proposing a highly controversial candidate like Gaetz, the administration may set an extreme anchor. Subsequent nominees, even if they have significant flaws, might then appear more acceptable in comparison. This tactic leverages the anchoring effect to shift public perception, making less desirable candidates seem more palatable relative to the initial, more contentious choice.

Understanding anchoring bias is crucial, as it highlights how initial information can disproportionately influence our evaluations and decisions, often without our conscious awareness.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"Romney's prototype of the ACA.


W's funding for fighting HIV.


Maybe the orange dipshit's freeze on student loans. Although in my estimation it was as much as a driver as his ppp graft in causing the inflation issue. But any sane person would have done it. That and his fast tracking of the fda process for vaccines but I also feel like that is pretty much nullified by his amplification of covid doubt and alternate remedies. 


W payed lip service to protecting Arab Americans after the New York bombing that while undermined by the actual actions of his appointments would be regarded as very sober by today's standards. 


Cheney's compartmentalization of social issues from the rest of the gop platform provided a model for other members of the party. 


I think W tried to do a work permit deal as a middle ground for immigration. 


A handful of the old guard, an embarrassingly small number, tried to draw a distinction between the maga psychosis and the war hawk, tax cut, starve the beast policies of your father's gop.


Romney was right when Barack roasted him for being too paranoid about the Russians. 




That's all I can think of as an honest answer to that question. 


If you go as far back as Gingrich, maybe welfare reform was bipartisan but I think that was more a measure of the dnc not having a cohesive social program story and being effectively seized by right wing news. 


It's really hard to say because maga is ideologically so alien from the gop prior to it or from any real viable position in legitimate discourse prior to it. Reagan was pro amnesty. Bush was for decriminalization of migrant work. 2015 came with very new and very unsettling popular sentiment about migrant workers, imports, speech, Russia, that it all was very disorienting for people who had been wearing the fig leaf before of old gop policies. I don't think 30 years is a great question.  There were plenty of Reaganite true believers in the 90s who had no idea it would turn into maga. Maybe 10 years would be a better question. ",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"There have been a lot of posts about ""once the tariffs hit people will see they fucked up and revolt!"".  While that sounds logical, I question that for the same reason that I was utterly terrified trump would win in the first place: how do you make the case that donad trump is unfit for office to someone who doesn't already believe it?

donald trump is an objectively terrible man that is totally unfit for office.  It is the most obvious thing in the entire world.  The sky is blue, the earth is round, donald trump should not be the President.  Its really that simple.  ,And any ""but his policies!"" argument needs to first begin by explaining why those policies make rape and January 6th acceptable.  You cant make such a case if you are living in reality.  You need to be under his spell to even consider him, because anyone that isn't under his spell can spend 5 seconds remembering who he is and realize he has no business being anywhere near the oval office.  And I just worry a lot of Americans are now under his spell.  And as far as his policies causing harm, we already know what his supporters do when that happens.  They'll lie, deflect, blame, do whatever it takes to avoid the shame of feeling ""I voted for a rapist because of his policies and now his policies are awful"".  

All summer long I just had this sneaking fear that trump would win.  That fear was born out of the fact that he had already done so many horrible disquaIifying things and he was still close.  It just made him feel inevitable, made it feel like this is just who America is.  A lot of Americans dont care about democracy.  A lot of them see a rapist and think ""hell yeah!  someone who wont take no for an answer!"".  A lot of them see a bully abusing others and they think its funny, they find joy in the pain hes causing.

"The US Constitution requires that department heads (aka cabinet members) may be appointed by the President ""with the advice and consent of the Senate."" What that means is that the Senate must agree with or approve the President's picks.

But the Constitution was written almost 250 years ago, and at that time it was expected that Congress would be out of session for long periods of time. The authors of the Constitution wanted to make sure that departments would not go without leadership just because Congress was out of session. So they added language that says, during a congressional recess, the President can make temporary appointments without Senate approval. Those are called ""recess appointments.""

In the modern era, there's really no reason not to wait until Congress is back in session. But the Supreme Court has ruled that the President can still make recess appointments to this day.

TLDR: Recess appointments are a constitutionally archaic but still valid way for a president to appoint senior officials without the consent of the Senate even when those appointments would normally require the approval of the Senate.

More details here:

https://www.history.com/news/constitution-congress-recess-appointments

EDIT: BTW, recess appointments are not just a Trump thing. Many (all?) modern presidents have used recess appointments to fill some senior positions when the Senate has been hostile to their picks. What's new this time is that Trump is demanding a Senate controlled by his own party help him use recess appointments instead of the normal process. He wants absolute control over his appointments and for the Senate to step aside and give up their ""advice and consent"" role entirely. Whether they do so or not is a significant test of whether Trump can ""rule like a dictator.""",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"The issue at hand is the vast majority of Americans have not actually ever conceived democracy is in question, it just is, it will always be. There are certainly marginalized groups who have had to fight for their rights and to openly exist but to anyone other than them it was an abstract.

All of the claimed threats to change people's way of lives has been manufactured to create angst but was never actually going to happen, like the Sharia Law panic, the endless wars to 'protect our freedoms'. It is a fiction and make believe threat, which of course we 'won' against because it was not a threat.

So how much of the dialogue about the risk someone like trump poses is just handwaved because 'it can't happen here'. Jan 6th happened, but we survived, so it was not 'serious' the country and everything just continued.

It took something like 9/11 to actually get people concerned, because it actually did 'happen here', I honestly believe half the country has PTSD from that and things like the disconnect between common sense and feelings are fractured.

Only until it does happen here will people actually react, likely very violently. The same people that support trump openly now should be the ones going most off the deep end because they are going to feel the most betrayed. Liberals etc know what is coming, the magas have little to no idea how bad this is going to be and as one of the defining traits of Republicans is they lack empathy IE they only care when something actually impacts them, I would expect it to be cheering this all along, and then a sudden explosion of revolt.

Not all of them of course but more than enough to cause problems. The two attempts* to assassinate trump were right wingers.

Also remember, the Senate is only in recess when it says it is in recess.

""Pro forma sessions"" are a thing.

When Republicans controlled the Senate, they used pro forma sessions to block Obama from making recess appointments.

In the old days (when horse and buggy cart travel was a thing), the Senate adjourning for a long recess made sense, because it could take days and/or weeks for the Senators to travel to and from their home state and DC (like, imagine how long it would take to travel via horse and buggy cart from SC or GA to DC). Also, no phones to communicate over long distances either.

So basically, the Senate would adjourn, the leaders would tell everyone when the next Senate session was due to begin (like 3 or 4 months after the adjournment), and then everyone went home (knowing they would have to be back in DC for the start date of the next session like 3 or 4 months from now).

But in today's world, ""full"" recesses are easy to break up. Thanks to airline travel, you can easily make it from anywhere in the country to DC is just a matter of hours.

The constitution says the Senate must be in recess for 10 days before the president can make a recess appointment. So, to block Obama from making recess appointments, a few GOP Senators would fly back to DC on ""day 9"" after the last seassion was adjourned, hang around the Senate for an hour or so, basically say ""We're here, the Senate is still *technically* in session"", and then they'd hop on a plane again to fly back home.

Obama made some recess appointments anyway when the Republicans were doing their pro forma shenanigans. The Republicans sued, and SCOTUS ruled (unanimously) that the president **cannot** make recess appointments while the Senate is conducting these pro forma sessions,  because the constitution states the Senate is free to make its own rules, and as such... ""The Senate is only in recess when it says it is in recess"". Thus, these brief pro forma sessions still *technically* count as sessions of the Senate (even if only a few Senators show up, and even if the ""session"" only lasts for under an hour).

If Thune wants to block Trump from making recess appointments, he can follow the GOP playbook for Obama: Get a few GOP Senators to show up at DC once every 9 days to conduct a ""pro forma session"". No recess, no appointment.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

It's weird that you're saying this is ""not the plan"" when Trump has stated that it is *publicly*.

If he can get the House to adjourn and the Senate refuses, he can use Article II, Section 3 to force the Senate to adjourn.

Ultimately, all of this really hangs on whether the Supreme Court will back him or not. I'm not hopeful.

Both Jan 6th and this new administration and its plan threaten world stability. Not on a war/peace thing but the US has been stable and the foundation for something like 90% of the economy of the world because of the stability of the US Dollar. Its purely backed by the ""Full faith and credit of the US government"" because it was seen as a stable government and an economic powerhouse. Once that faith in the USD tanks, both internally and externally, everything else tanks. Stocks, import/export, etc. We are already seeing stuff over the last few years. Global trade was largely protected by the US Navy patrolling the seas and keeping the sea lines safe. They have scaled back and will probably stop almost all together, which will see a raise in piracy and impact global trade.

Once that goes away, the rest of the world that uses USD goes with it. The BRIC countries will like to think they will be fine, but the BRIC countries are still largely tied to USD.

I am writing to request that the ethics report concerning Representative Matt Gaetz be made public in the interest of transparency and accountability. Given your role as the ranking member on the Ethics Committee, I respectfully urge you to consider reading the report into the congressional record under the Speech and Debate Clause to ensure that the public is informed about the findings.

The American people have a right to know the details surrounding this investigation, especially as it pertains to the conduct of an elected official. Transparency is essential for public trust, and making this report accessible would reinforce our commitment to ethical standards in Congress.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and for your ongoing dedication to integrity in public service.

Dems let these things go constantly, they refuse to out these things and make their positions untenable and allow the corruption to fester. There is also basically a single answer here, they won't leak it or press republicans hard to get them removed... because they are also guilty of doing a bunch of corrupt shit, mostly around who they take money from and what they vote for while in office.

The American people have a right to know the details surrounding this investigation, especially as it pertains to the conduct of an elected official. Transparency is essential for public trust, and making this report accessible would reinforce our commitment to ethical standards in Congress.

>Under this scheme, it appears that the House would adopt a concurrent resolution that provides for the adjournment of both the House and the Senate.

"NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014), where the U.S. Supreme Court provided guidance on what counts as a “recess”:

1. “Recess” includes both intersession and intrasession breaks: The Court ruled that recesses include breaks within a Senate session (intrasession recesses) as well as breaks between two sessions (intersession recesses). This clarified that the President can make appointments during any sufficiently long break in Senate activity, not just at the end of the Senate’s yearly work.


2. A break must be of “substantial length”: In Noel Canning, the Court established that breaks shorter than 10 days are typically too short to count as a recess that allows for a recess appointment. This created a general rule: a recess of less than 10 days does not qualify as a ""recess"" for the purposes of making appointments.


3. Pro forma sessions: The case also addressed “pro forma” sessions, which are brief meetings held with no legislative business (sometimes lasting only minutes) to technically keep the Senate “in session.” **The Court ruled that if the Senate says it is in session, even during pro forma sessions, it is indeed considered in session.** This means that a President cannot make a recess appointment during these pro forma sessions.

"That’s exactly what I’m afraid of. My initial reaction to these nominations was relief that we’d be dealing with the same old clown car, rather than a much more effective slate of smart, disciplined, Heritage Foundation ghouls I’d never heard of. The only things giving me comfort are:

1: Trump probably hasn’t heard of said ghouls either. I’m sure his handlers have ideas, but I doubt he himself has really looked into it and “wants” particular people for these jobs. And he may be more resistant to direction this time.

2: Trump does like trolling, but he doesn’t like being the object of a “joke” himself, and this gambit makes him look incompetent. Plus threatening us with Tulsi Gabbard in particular (“I’m going to install a Russian asset—just kidding!”) comes way too close to acknowledging a bunch of truths he’d rather not have out in the open.

Third: that rules that can be waived are the worst of all; for nothing erodes confidence in the government as fast as selective enforcement.

Simply put: Trump has circumvented the rules; broken those he could not circumvent; was not punished for breaking them; delayed what punishment he was given; and colluded with the very authorities tasked with holding him accountable to ensure no punishment was actually delivered.

The man is as morally as he is financially bankrupt; but in the last eight years, he’s delivered a masterclass in working every flaw, oversight, and loophole in the system.

Or

> It’s really difficult for Israel to deal with Hamas because they hide among the civilians. Meanwhile it was pretty easy for the military to track down the Jan 6 insurrectionists because civilians would proactively snitch on them. And BLM policed themselves to the point the military didn’t need to intervene at all. Is there a connection between the military’s restraint and civilian hostility towards domestic terror tactics?

Military pushback is also predicated on *inaction*. Aka, lower levels just not taking initiative to help to new buffoon can have the same result as the original leader saying no.

Yet history reveals our conventional wisdom may be wrong, that it may be the opposite, that those things expose us directly to the cancer in ways we don’t understand.

The ways in which the cancer grips a pre-Pot Cambodia or pre-Stalin Russia are very different than where we are culturally, so we fool ourselves into feeling relatively safe.

But there’s a highway—mostly a highway of complacency—which leads directly from advanced industrialization right to hell in a hand-basket, and our car is packed and fueled.

"I hope everyone who works in nonprofits, community mental health, outreach for the homeless, DV shelters, prisons and jails, nursing homes, hospitals, and in social science research prepares for:

1. Layoffs and termination that's retaliatory 

2. Unfounded licensure complaints when you put your code of ethics above brain worms

3. Diversion of funding from evidence based programs and needed research on infectious disease, aging, child safety, women's health, lgbtq health and poverty to quakery science that will actually drive the collective delusional thinking we already see while simultaneously increasing prevalence and severity of stress related diseases. Hypnosis and essential oils will replace rested behavioral interventions. Mid-level marketing gurus will become the thought leaders.

Infant mortality rates, suicide and homelessness rates will rise. Denying the people most vulnerable a safety net and ignoring data never results in savings to tax payers. It results in the opposite. When everyone is forced to use the ER as their primary care doctor, someone still pays the bill. That's us...the middle class. Do not assume RFK is stupid. He might be demented, but he's a Kennedy. He's never identified with the working class, let alone the poors. This includes children. In the US, 13.8 million children currently live in homes with food insecurity. Putting a conspiracy theorist with sociopathic tendencies towards animals is highly predictive of a personality type that lacks empathy for children. 

Expect rates of death due to overdose to rise dramatically. 

4. Denial of benefits for clients and patients who rely on section 8, SNAP benefits (food stamps) and WIC (food benefits for children and pregnant mothers, housing vouchers, and more. 

I would also be very worried about how this will effect Medicaid, Medicare, and SSDI, as well as SSI. These programs and agencies are more intertwined than people realize. The FDA will also be very vulnerable to corruption and defunding. Stock up on medications now, if you're a social service provider, a social scientist or living in poverty, try to move to a blue state. 

I used to work in many of these areas as a scientist, as a social worker and as a policy analyst. I also used to be a regulatory professional and have been whistleblowing on the pervasive negligence and corruption within these systems since 2004. The ways that our government has responded to me putting the safety of my colleagues, the empiricism of research, the rights of research participants and the autonomy of patients has resulted in me facing retaliation like you wouldn't believe, even in a very liberal state and area (Seattle). Most of my colleagues have chosen for decades to look the other way.

I'm a firm believer that a dictator cannot rise to this level of power solely relying on their sycophants.

Yes, at least that ""conservative"" prizes loyalty to Dear Leader more than anything. I also did not know anyone *deserves* a position in government; it is just weird to think someone is owed a department like that.

A ""moderate conservative"" is ready for Bobby to start ""cleaning up kids’ school lunches,"" meanwhile commenters in the same post deride Obama's effort to put healthier food in schools. So they only want healthy kids when their team's in charge so they can take credit. Kids are their political tools.

"Thing is, you can't even self produce your own eggs for that cost... 50 lb bag of feed is $25-28 now. And you have to feed them for 4-6 months before they even lay, build or purchase a chicken coop, predator safe fencing for their run area or yard, feeders and watering buckets, brooder and warming system when they are younger, etc. Baby chicks are cheap at typically $2-8 each depending on breed, sex, etc. But by the time you are getting to laying age, if it is your first flock and you're starting from scratch you are already out $500 minimum. Then in winter they stop laying unless you force them under lights because they won't lay eggs if there is less than 14 hrs/ day, ideally 16 hrs of light/ day for max yields. So you really only reliably collect eggs for about 6-maybe 8 months a year if you're lucky, and no eggs at all during the winter. And they molt each fall once days start getting shorter, which significantly decreases their production each time. Domestic ducks are more reliable layers, but more cost not only up front but eat more food and make more mess so you spend more time cleaning. (Ducks are however much more entertaining.)

At the end of the day, I need to sell my extra self produced small scale chicken eggs at $6/ dozen and duck eggs at $8/ dozen to break even once you factor in all the overhead.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Maybe I am missing something but I don't see a super huge correlation between him lobbying for Rick Scott vs. lobbying for spending reductions. But it does seem like a pretty useless assignment.

And hey, honestly, making myself do it has gotten me to be a lot better and more comfortable doing so, so hey, it's win-win.

I can give you an example of how he's not smart. When he took over Twitter, he made his employees justify their continued employment based on the number of lines of code they wrote. Here's the thing, anyone who's done programming, will tell you it's not about numbers. Bloating code only means you've introduced all sorts of possible new points of failure. The trick to coding is to keep things simple and concise. I know, I studied Computer Science at RIT. I've written lots of code in my day. I don't work in the field, and never finished my degree due to a lot of mental health circumstances and two (at the time) undiagnosed learning disabilities. Had I been properly diagnosed and medicated for my depression and comorbid ADHD, along with my autism, I probably would've done well. But things ended up working out well for me and I'm in a government job I genuinely love and excel in, because hey, 'sperg brains LOOOOOVE repetitive, clearly defined tasks. 
  
Anyway, an actually smart person would've realized they didn't know jack shit about coding, and just deferred to the experts, the people who do it on a daily basis. They know what they're doing. But he believes he knows better. He does not. Because he cannot handle being told he is wrong and doesn't know what he's talking about. That's pathetic, to me.
  
Like, I'm not a goddamned genius. I'm relatively smart, sure, but I have a looooooot of defecits to more than make up for that. Being humble and owning it when you don't know something will get you much further in life, than doubling down because EVERYBODY else must be wrong, not you. There's a goddamned metric fuckton of stuff I don't know about, but you know what? I'd *like* to find out about it.

"I agree, but I feel like in so doing I'm deflecting my worry from two other major factions that ARE fairly competent and equally empowered for the next 2 years: Congress and the Judiciary.  

Trump's personal goals and ambitions for the next 4 years will likely accomplish a fraction of what they aspire to -- a huge hurt to the Country and its people in the meanwhile, but far less than the horror we may imagine from his speeches.  Barring a colossal misstep internationally that sets off a nuclear war (unfortunately, not a total impossibility -- and the lasting worries of an increasingly nuclear-weaponized world if the US pulls out of its global oversight), nothing that is done by Trump through his policies cannot be undone, amended, or expanded (who knows, maybe we'll get lucky -- the guy's the human equivalent of a room full of monkeys eventually typing Shakespeare) in time.

The greater concern is a Republican Congress and the likelihood of Judicial appointments.  Trump will likely be ineffective, but he's also just uncaring enough about his job to essentially be a rubber-stamp to anyone he likes and thereby trusts.  These are the best people after all, because he chose them.  If a Republican Congress finds itself unified and energized in its collective will, it can and will advance to Trump's desk any number of bills to fit their agenda.  Sadly, I've not done a deep dive into the individual campaigns and promises of each member of the new Congress to map out the likelihood of their future voting history (it's coming... eventually) so it's hard to say whether that unified vision will coalesce (either by principal, coercion, or simple kowtowing).",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Oh, the Muskrat is absolutely talented at entrepreneurship and PR, I will absolutely agree with you on that.
  
Hahaha, Trump is a legitimately *awful* businessman. He failed at selling meat, gambling, booze, and football to Americans, because of his own stupidity and hubris and it's kind of spectacular in a really fucked up way.
  
Like, the man sold Trump Steaks exclusively through the Sharper Image. If you're not familiar with them, they're a kind of upscale electronics and novelty shop. It's...not the kind of place anyone in their right fucking mind would want to buy meat from. It'd be like saying, ""Hey, honey, I have a hankering for some ribeye, let's go to Radio Shack!"". It's just a *colossally* stupid idea.
  
Also, he tanked a successful minor league football organization when he bought a team. IIRC, they were doing well and actually getting tv coverage because they played in the off-season of the NFL. Trump decided, in all his wisdom, to pit this minor league against the goddamned NFL. Like, I don't know much about football because I'm not particularly interested in it as a sport, it's just not my thing. But, y'know, I'm just a tad bit sure that, if I had a competing sports league, I'm not going to go up against the established major league that's a multi-billion dollar industry.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"Tulsi and her entire family (including her State Senator father) are active cult members in Hawai‘i called “The Science of Identity Foundation.”  Which essentially are a bunch of former Hare Krishnas from the 70s/80s who formed their own organization The Science of Identity Foundation following their leader Chris Butler.  Tulsi’s parents Senator Mike and Carol Gabbard are known to be extremely high up in this cult that Tulsi was raised in. She openly calls Chris Butler her “guru,” mentor, and advisor….

I know this all sounds pretty wild, but read any of these articles, and if you’re in the Intelligence profession, check out Lanikai, Kailua on the island of Oahu out. Chris Butler lives there. 

Review, verify, document, and pass along.  We can’t have a cult member be the Director of National Intelligence. Her cult membership needs much more national, mainstream coverage and awareness.

John Bolton lack of any form of credibility as evidenced by two quagmire and trillions of wasted dollars from he and his hawks.

Anyone who thinks he is credible in any way shape or form doesn't remember the iraq war.

"Trump is not and never was a germaphobe or hypochondriac. I have to point this out every time people repeat this claim, which he himself has made.

Trump doesn't like to shake the hands of people he thinks are beneath him (which is nearly everyone) so he claims to be a germaphobe.  This stands in stark contrast to how, when he does want to shake the hand of someone at his level or above, he purposely pulls them off balance and right into his face. Also, he has practiced barrier free sex all his life according to multiple spouses, girlfriends, and affair partners, including raw-dogging an actual porn star (Stormy Daniels). He himself said STIs in the 60s and 70s were his personal Vietnam. 

He was anti-mask and anti-vaccine, even attending the Biden debate in 2020 after testing positive for covid and in violation of the rules (he arrived so late that the debate hosts didn't have time to test him). 

He doesn't exercise, eat healthy, or display ANY behavior that is evidence that he understands how human health or germ theory even works.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

The very year we celebrated the highest number of vaccine clinics all over the world, covid hit and suddenly my entire club became antivax.

* raw milk and hyperbaric therapies (you can get raw milk, it's not that hard, and there are 4 hyperbaric clinics in my town)

* clean food, neutraceuticals (which is just...healthy, vitamin and nutrient-rich food? What are they suppressing here? Apples and zucchini don't cure cancer)

So, basically, nothing he mentions is being suppressed, except the stuff that is which is being blocked by the Republican party, or its lot of shit that hasn't been scientifically proven to work. The rest is being sold by kooks like Alex Jones and other right-leaning grifters.

I saw on other tweets he wanted to get rid of a bunch of pesticides, which is cool, because there are some legit bad ones. Good luck getting the farming industry or your Republican colleagues to agree to it. Or, just in general, good luck getting rid of the corporate capture of the agency.

“**Limit which disabilities qualify veterans for benefits.** The authors of Project 2025 think that too many veterans qualify for disability benefits.

Disability benefits are often critical lifelines for veterans who became disabled as a result of their military service - and can be the difference between a veteran being able to put food on the table or not

Project 2025 proposes to have the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs cut costs by having fewer health conditions qualify veterans for disability benefits - a proposal could greatly restrict disabled veterans’ access to life-sustaining benefits.

From Mandate for Leadership p. 649-650” 

Fulcrum - [Project 2025: The Department of Veterans Affairs](https://thefulcrum.us/governance-legislation/project-2025-veterans)

“Both the Democratic and Republican parties also generally demonstrate strong support for veterans and their benefits. However, both parties still debate specific policy implementation and budget allocation. The Republican Party has expressed a preference for moving to a public-private partnership to administer many veterans benefits, while (most of) the Democratic Party favors investing in public infrastructure to meet VA mandates.”

“For the quarter ending March 2024, 80.4 percent of veterans expressed trust in the VA, with 91.8 percent specifically trusting VA health services.”

“However, multiple systematic reviews comparing VA and non-VA health care outcomes show that the VHA generally provides equal or better quality care, particularly regarding mortality rates and in safety, equity, and specific surgical and clinical outcomes.”

“A recent audit by the VA Office of Inspector General concurred and highlighted concerns that increased spending on community care could erode the VA’s direct care system and limit choice for veterans who prefer VA services. It warned that diverting funds from the VA to private care could reduce the quality of direct VA care.”

Defeat Project 2025 - [Veterans](https://defeatproject2025.org/issues/veterans/)

“Project 2025 proposes that the VA reduce expenses by cutting benefits while funneling a larger fraction of its current budget into the pockets of private contractors. It proposes a personnel policy of replacing the leadership and decision makers with political appointees, while outsourcing core functions and silencing dissent from existing staff. It mixes policies from the current VA strategic plan with a dangerous vein of reduced benefits, corporate plundering, and politicization.” 

Raw Story - [Project 2025 will rob veterans and active duty troops of billions in benefits](https://www.rawstory.com/project-2025-veterans/)

“Among other recommendations, the plan proposes eliminating concurrent eligibility for both service-related disability benefits and military retirement benefits, which Tucker says would reduce mandatory outlays by at least $160 billion through 2032, and revising the disability rating awards that determine eligibility for benefits and determine monthly disability compensation to reap ‘significant cost savings.’

The plan also proposes to end enrollment in VA medical care for veterans in two low-priority groups to save an estimated $69 billion through 2032 and narrow eligibility for veterans disability by excluding disabilities that cannot be related to military service, which would save an estimated $37.6 billion during that same period.”

Government Executive - [Project 2025: The worst-case scenario for veterans](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/07/project-2025-worst-case-scenario-veterans/397874/)

“Veterans make up roughly 30% of the federal workforce, with approximately 300,000 veterans currently employed by the federal government.”

“Many of these veterans, including a substantial number who are disabled, find employment in agencies that Project 2025 targets for elimination, such as the FBI and the Justice Department.”

“By suggesting a 50% reduction in federal employees within a year and 75% within four years, Project 2025 is essentially advocating for a skeletal government, unable to perform its fundamental functions.”

“By dismantling key agencies and slashing federal jobs, Project 2025 risks undermining not only government efficiency but also the livelihoods of tens of thousands of veterans. These actions will have far-reaching consequences, weakening the very fabric of our nation’s administrative capabilities, betraying our veterans, and damaging the economy to prove a twisted point. We must ask ourselves what is more important: the livelihoods of our veterans and the health of our economy, or the whims of the few who want to dismantle the government.”",2024_11_15,15_38_23

There are no 'Unauthorized Programs', Congress has the power of the purse, literally from Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7, iirc, not the executive branch.

"From a WaPo article:

Although changes to government spending typically require an act of Congress, Trump aides are exploring plans to challenge a 1974 budget law in a way that would give the White House the power to unilaterally adopt the Musk commission’s proposals, one of the people said. It is unclear if Trump will ask Congress to approve changes to the budget law or first appeal to the courts to do so, though aides have previously endorsed either approach. Ramaswamy, a former pharmaceutical executive who has said he would “stop funding agencies that waste money” and don’t operate on meritocratic principles, has publicly called on Congress to repeal the law and has suggested workarounds if it is not repealed.      

That effort, if successful, could give Trump far greater authority to remake the federal budget on his own, altering the balance of power among the branches of government. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump and many of his senior advisers publicly vowed to assert unilateral authority to rescind some federal funds, after Trump’s attempts to block aid to Ukraine led to his impeachment during his first term.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"The article definitely has a baiting angle, but that doesn’t mean it’s purely baseless. While it may use provocative framing, it highlights a real possibility that Ramaswamy’s broad proposals to cut federal agencies could lead to significant, even unintended, consequences—like impacts on veterans’ healthcare.

"The money always comes from somewhere. Ramaswamy didn't offer any details about why that money is being used where it is, or what the Congressional appropriation for that money is and which bills issued that funding. He didn't even identify a single exact program. It sounds to me like dishonesty on his part, which isn't surprising. Congress often defers to the executive branch to allow it to dispense funds how it sees fit. Congressional intent matters a lot. It's quite likely that most of the money he pretends isn't authorized was simply appropriated by Congress for general funds to keep doing what's been done before. Unfortunately that's similarly how it's been done with continuing resolutions lately in a different way to avoid government shutdowns.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"Your friends probably don’t know a single thing about the Council for National Policy, which has been around since the 80’s. Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon were members of this elite billionaire-funded Christian nationalist group well before Trump descended his golden escalator.

[Council for National Policy Membership Directory 2014 (Redacted)](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/cnp_redacted_final.pdf)

It is best to think of Trump as a vote-getting machine and his backers as the ones crafting policy and staffing his administration with folks who will execute the plan. Back when Trump suddenly appeared on the political scene, his eventual backers were caught unprepared during his first term, but the network has been hard at work since then to maximize the advancement of their agenda in a second Trump administration.

If you climb up the food chain of deeply conservative Christian nationalist and libertarian organizations vying for control of the country, you’ll find the Council for National Policy, which serves as an umbrella organization for its member groups. The Heritage Foundation is their most prominent think tank. Awareness of the Heritage Foundation is important to discuss because Project 2025 is in the news, but it can be hard to connect the dots until you are familiar with the CNP.

Back in 2016, the Council for National Policy was pushing for Ted Cruz, but they were unable to stop Trump from winning the primary. Trump did not have an administrative team or any policies to speak of at the time because he ran on a narcissistic whim for self-promotion, not expecting to win.

After winning the primary, he gained the support of the Council for National Policy by promising, for example, to give them their justice picks and use extremists from the CNP in key positions within his administration. The CNP never had so much wide-ranging, direct access before so they enthusiastically adopted Trump as their “imperfect vessel” and directed their member groups to fall in line and support him.

New Republic - [A Rare Peek Inside the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy](https://newrepublic.com/article/167002/council-national-policy-documents-right-wing-conspiracy)

“The Heritage Foundation, a meeting sponsor, has been a core partner of the Council for National Policy from the start, and Heritage president Kevin Roberts is on the CNP board of governors.”

“Together, the organizations would serve as a three-legged stool for the right, with Heritage [Foundation] as the think tank; [American Legislative Exchange Council] as a state-level ‘bill mill’; and the [Council for National Policy] as a coordinating body for donors, media, and activists.”

Washington Post - [God, Trump and the Closed-Door World of a Major Conservative Group](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/10/25/god-trump-closed-door-world-council-national-policy/)

“In October 2015, Donald Trump was still a laugh line for right-wing Christian activists. By their lights he was a failed casino owner and thrice-married playboy. He had no apparent principles, no policy blueprint and no grasp of the Bible. He didn’t even understand free-market theory, something they consider to be a fountainhead of American liberty. Yet here he was in a conference room at the Ritz-Carlton in McLean, Va., soliciting support from a closed-door group of conservative leaders called the Council for National Policy.”

“For months after the event, Dannenfelser and some other CNP members were determined to stop Trump. While he solidified his lead as GOP front-runner, they denounced him as a ‘charlatan’ in the conservative magazine National Review, blasted his prior support of abortion rights and implored Republican voters to choose another candidate.”

“Then came a great swerve that would upend politics in America: Millions of conservatives — Dannenfelser and other CNP members among them — got firmly behind Trump.”

“McGahn thought Trump could benefit by releasing a list of nominees to replace Scalia, an unusual move that would reassure religious and social conservatives who wanted an anti-abortion jurist. Trump expressed support for one of Leo’s long-cherished goals: a federal court system dominated by judges who would interpret the Constitution in ways that favored business and conservative views.”

“In the summer of 2016, Trump made another strategic move that would seal the deal with Dannenfelser, the anti-abortion activist, and other CNP members. He pledged to oppose abortion and put the promises onto paper in September. ‘Dear Pro-Life Leader,’ Trump’s letter began. ‘I am writing to invite you to join my campaign’s Pro-Life Coalition, which is being spearheaded by longtime leader Marjorie Dannenfelser.’ Trump said he would nominate ‘pro-life justices to the U.S. Supreme Court,’ defund Planned Parenthood and take other measures that the anti-abortion activists had demanded.

Dannenfelser was thrilled. ‘Before that we were still stomping our feet,’ she said last year at a CNP meeting, according to one of the internal videos. ‘Little did we know that this man, who was a performer and can incite audiences in ways we never even thought could be, would galvanize audiences in battleground states all over the country and put life at the center of the project.’ The CNP crowd whooped and hollered at her remarks.

In Reed’s book, he writes that Dannenfelser told him: ‘Trump was my last choice until he was my first.’”

Washington Spectator - [How the CNP, a Republican Powerhouse, Helped Spawn Trumpism, Disrupted the Transfer of Power, and Stoked the Assault on the Capitol](https://washingtonspectator.org/nelson-cnp/)

“Operating from the shadows, [the Council for National Policy’s] members, who would number some 400, spent the next four decades courting, buying, and bullying fellow Republicans, gradually achieving what was in effect a leveraged buyout of the GOP.”

“In 2016, the CNP put its partners’ money, data, and ground game behind Donald Trump, as the ultimate transactional candidate. Trump promised it retrograde social policies, a favorable tax regime, regulatory retreats, and its choice of federal judges. He delivered in spades. By 2020, the leaders of the CNP were ready to go to extreme lengths to keep him—and themselves—in power.”

“Donald Trump remained a dependable ally, asking only for an audience for his megalomania and a free pass for the business interests of the ‘Trump brand.’ In return, he delivered his dynamism and his unshakeable base.”

“Ultimate realization of the CNP’s agenda depended on winning a second term for Trump in November. With another four years, it could enshrine its socially regressive policies on the federal level, further blur the line between church and state, and consolidate huge windfalls for corporations and wealthy individuals.”",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"As far as it having nothing to do with Trump, Russell Vought, Trump’s former director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, completely dismisses Trump’s disavowal of Project 2025. Vought’s job over the past few years has apparently been the wonky bits of making Project 2025 shovel-ready for Day 1.

Ask your friends who Vought is and why he’s been getting funding to do the *very specific* things that he’s been doing.

Centre for Climate Reporting - Undercover in Project 2025 ([Article](https://climate-reporting.org/undercover-in-project-2025/) | [Video](https://youtu.be/PY_chqyaRHo) 9:51)

[Russel Vought]  is the founder and president of the Center for Renewing America, a conservative think tank he described to his hosts as ‘the Death Star,’ which alongside the Heritage Foundation has been at the heart of Project 2025.

“Vought said he is overseeing the drafting of hundreds of executive orders, regulations and secretarial memos, to help make the US conservative movement’s radical goals a reality. These include plans for the ‘largest deportation in history’ – a promise also made by Trump – and a proposal to use the military against US citizens to suppress large-scale protests in response. This will, Vought said, help to end multiculturalism in the United States.”

“Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Convention’s Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaign’s trust in him and his ideas.”

“A key part of Project 2025’s plans is to give the President more powers, removing the independence of agencies like the Department of Justice and FBI. Vought has dedicated his time to helping make this a reality if Trump wins in November.

‘Eighty percent of my time is working on the plans of what’s necessary to take control of these bureaucracies,’ Vought said, ‘And we are working doggedly on that, whether it’s destroying their agency’s notion of independence — they’re independent from the President — whether it’s bringing back concepts that ruled until Nixon of impoundment — the ability to not spend money — whether that is thinking through how the deportation would work. Those are all the things that we are working on predominantly right now.’”

“Vought, who told the undercover reporters he had a deep relationship with the Trump campaign, even dismissed his former boss’s disavowal of Project 2025. He said his close relationship with Trump means that he can put these transition documents directly into his hands. ‘There are people like me that have his trust that will be able to get it to him in whatever position we’re at,’ he said. ‘The relationships will be there. The trust level will be there.’

Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Convention’s Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaign’s trust in him and his ideas.”",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"Here’s the TL;DR, in case it helps.

Christian nationalist billionaires want to take over the US government because their particular flavor of Christianity demands it. They groomed Ted Cruz to be the guy that they’d put in the White House. Trump came out of nowhere and crushed Cruz. Trump then needed help from the CNP to get elected. In exchange, Trump basically tossed them the keys to his administration. The CNP used to lobby and bully administrations, they never ran one themselves so they could only do so much once they were given the Trump administration. They set up Project 2025 and Vought’s detailed step-by-step documentation so that they could achieve everything on their wishlist during a second administration.

Bottomline is that it was Trump’s job to get elected. That’s it. Everything else is being run by a vast Christian nationalist network headed by the Council for National Policy.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"She isn’t a Russian asset. She just doesn’t support the notion of forever wars. And I (also a former US military officer) totally agree with her (at least as far as the Ukraine goes.

People have to realize that just because a stance is what a rival might want, that doesn’t mean it isn’t still in our own best interest. US Policy should be evaluated on the totality of whether or not it is in the best interest of the US. Now of course how good that policy is for a rival can be part of the equation, but only part.

In my, and an increased percentage of the US citizens’ opinions, it is time for the US to reduce its global footprint and overseas security obligations. Does Russia want that? Yep. China? Yep. So what? If we can reduce our military spending down to a 2–2.5% of GDP level (which is in line with most, and more than many, NATO countries’ spending levels, that’s good for US Citizens.

The US has shouldered the security burden for Europe since the end of WWII. For a while that made sense. But no longer. We are $35T in debt, with unfunded liabilities another $80T or so. We can no longer afford to guarantee ther security against conventional forces.

And, I’ve written this many times, the EU has 4x the population and 10x the GDP of Russia. If the EU can’t defend themselves against Russian conventional forces, that’s their decision because they have the men and the means to do so.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"We know Russia was heavily involved in our election in 2016; the Mueller report confirms this, by the 12 Russian Intelligence officers' indictments, due to their tampering. He also reported that they interfered in ""sweeping and systemic fashion.""

In 2020, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to the House Committee on Homeland Security in September of 2020, that Russian efforts were maximized, to damage the Biden campaign, and were incredibly active.  Microsoft came out, to help safeguard the 2020 elections, and announced that 10,000 customers have been targeted or compromised by nation-state attacks, by Russia, to target political organizations. They even changed internal policy due to these attacks, extending end-of-life updates from 2019 to 2020, to protect against these threats.

And we have current sources that the bomb threats to Swing State voting locations originated from Russian sources, in the 2024 election. And this is maybe a fraction of what we know so far.

"The war in Ukraine is no Afghanistan. It's a sovereign nation trying to defend itself from an invader, just like when Kuwait needed help fighting off Iraq's invasion. There's not going to be a messy occupation with an indeterminate end trying to keep down insurgencies rising from the native population; Russia just needs to leave.

And we don't even have to send troops! We have huge stockpiles of already-produced tanks and missiles that we're sending them. Equipment that was made to fight the Russians in the first place.

And we gets benefits beyond a warm fuzzy feeling, such as the world's bread basket not being owned by a hostile nation that can play with global food supply. China sees a strong response and maybe Xi decides to stay out of Taiwan and leave the increasingly crucial supply of chips alone.

You want to reduce the spending on the military, fine -- but attack the problem at the source rather than withholding already-produced equipment. Find ways to reduce the feedback loops between congressional representation and pork for districts, increase competition between contractors, etc. Johnny Harris has [a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqJ0kg9xvLs) on the subject.

Overall pretending this war is too costly or a ""forever war"" is just kinda silly. In 2 years we've spent ~$100 billion on it (much in terms of value of the weaponry *already made*), so about ~5% of overall military spending; Trump's tax cuts cost us **$2 trillion**!

"Agents and assets are two different things.

It's not necessarily illegal to be a Russian asset. That can include useful idiots. I think Tulsi qualifies as an asset to Russia by the sheer volume of Kremlin talking points she spouts.

It's also not necessarily illegal to be a Russian agent if you register. Though Tulsi also has some weird connections to unregistered agents. In 2017 she hired Chris Cooper, who had been named in a Senate Judiciary Commitee memo the previous year as aiding an unregistered Russian agent screen a Kremlin propaganda film in DC (the same agent at the center of the Trump tower meetings).

She was also the sole recipient of two separate donations from another accused unregistered Russian agent. The amount was small but could have been symbolic of something -- this agent was trying to recruit some unnamed representative in Hawaii to come on a trip to Russia, according to an FBI report.

It's not fire, but it starts to smell like smoke when it surrounds a person who always takes Putin's side.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Joined NATO when Russia was already struggling with its war against Ukraine.

And perhaps it is not too late to advance a view that, I believe, is not only mine alone but is shared by a number of others with extensive and in most instances more recent experience in Russian matters. The view, bluntly stated, is that expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era.

>Such a decision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking. And, last but not least, it might make it much more difficult, if not impossible, to secure the Russian Duma's ratification of the Start II agreement and to achieve further reductions of nuclear weaponry.

From my personal point of view, go for it. Germanys future relies on qualified immigration. That being said, Germany is very bureaucratic when it comes to immigration from non-EU countries. There are horror stories of highly qualified immigrants who lived here for years and still don’t know if they can stay and bureaucrats make them a very hard time, which is a shame because qualified immigration is crucial to our future. This will be different if you’re able to get citizenship, but you can also live here for a while without citizenship.

"You're underestimating Ukraine's technical capabilities. While initial launch codes were indeed Russian, Ukraine hosted a significant portion of the Soviet nuclear program and had the technical expertise to eventually bypass these controls. Many Ukrainian scientists and engineers who worked on these weapons could have modified the systems - it's not insurmountable technical challenge for a country with Ukraine's industrial and scientific base.

As for maintenance costs - yes, they would have been high, but consider the alternative cost Ukraine is paying now. The price of maintaining even a minimal nuclear deterrent would pale in comparison to the hundreds of billions in war damages and thousands of lives lost. Look at North Korea - a far poorer country that managed to maintain and develop nuclear weapons despite international pressure and sanctions.

The ""political pressure"" argument also loses merit when you see what happened to Ukraine after disarmament. The current situation proves exactly why countries seek nuclear weapons - and why Ukraine would have found a way to keep at least some of them operational if they knew the security assurances would prove so weak.

The reality is that no nuclear-armed state has ever been invaded by a conventional army. That fact alone demonstrates why Ukraine would be in a very different position today had they retained even a fraction of their arsenal.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"A cursory review of her statements on Russia and Ukraine supports the accusation that she is sympathetic to Russian ideology, if not actively trying to support it by using her platform as a politician. 

She blames the US for Russia attacking Ukraine. 

She knowingly falsely accused the US of having a chemical and biological weapons factory in Ukraine and said that it was justification for Russia to attack and defend itself. 

She stated that had Ukraine not decided to try and join NATO, Russia would have no reason to attack it, but Ukraines request to join forced Russias hand, and thus they needed to attack to protect their borders.

She does not support Ukrainian sovereignty. She continues to assert that Ukrainians civilians are ethnic Russians and therefor Russia is simply taking back its own land.

She hasn't done anything at all in her career to qualify her for the position, nothing to giver her any relevant experience. Okay, *sometimes* anyone outsider with a different way of thinking can be good for stuff.

But here's stated positions do not jive whatsoever with the US intelligence mission. I think half those agencies are lying scumbag traitors that have fundamentally moral and immoral principles that aren't American or patriotic. BUT the American position in the world, it's international relations and foreign policy don't mesh with Tulsis positions. Abdicating and withdrawing from our position weakens the US and makes us more susceptible in a war, while empowering our enemies.

And make no mistake: Russia, Iran, and China are all angling for war with the West. Russia and Iran are *currently at war with us*. China will move on Taiwan within the next decade.

The war is coming whether you want to fight it or not. Tulsi can't be in charge if her aim is to disengage and stand down, no matter what her intentions are.

"It’s not strictly Russian propaganda. Many Americans have independently reached similar conclusions based on geopolitics and an objective analysis of the war. Even the Biden administration acknowledged the war was unwinnable despite U.S. arms support, delaying HIMARs, tanks, and F-16s due to the belief that it would be futile. Let's not forget, Biden urged Zelensky to negotiate in 2022.

The reality is, NATO’s eastward expansion isn’t purely Russian propaganda either. Russia has long stated that any encroachment—particularly NATO's expansion into former Eastern Bloc countries or bordering nations—is a direct threat and warned they would respond militarily if pushed.

The U.S. has the Monroe Doctrine, which essentially claims the entire Western Hemisphere and warns that any encroachment will be treated as a national security threat. We even attempted to invade Cuba for this reason. Yet, when Russia uses similar rationale, it’s supposed to be irrational?

I’m a Democrat, and these are the conclusions I came to on my own at the start of the war. My view is unpopular on the left, but it mainly came down to analyzing the map, considering Russia’s strategic and national security needs, and asking whether the United States might respond similarly if placed in the same position.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"I think if the absolute worst case scenario occurs you'll see the western and eastern blue states splinter off into their own alliances of smaller independant countries. Whats left of America is then Trump ordering the military to invade and take them back leading to a civil war.

Realistically, I think America just slowly rots and decays over the next 4 years. They slowly add new lines into bills allowing Republicans to freely redraw all district lines across the country so they will never lose an election ever again. At that point, you'll see blue states withhold funding to the rest of the country in hopes Trump's admin realizes civil unrest over doing that might lead to a lot of moderate and Republican voters turning on them too. So they drop it and Democrats hopefully win the next election.

Which means if a Democrat wins in 2028 they'll be spending 4 years once again trying to fix literally every single little thing Trump's team shattered into billions of pieces so they get little done and America with its goldfish memory re-elects the Republicans in 2032 to cause even more catastrophic damage.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

If the system was fair and just, I might feel shame for jumping to a conclusion, but this is not the world we live in, clearly.

It's the Ukrainians who are brave. I'll let them make the call when they don't think it's worth the tradeoff. I'm just suggesting we give them what *they* are asking for *to help prevent the slaughter of more Ukrainians*. Ukraine isn't going to give up, and if people are going to die in the war, I'd rather it be the invading Russian soldiers, not the Ukrainian soldiers *and* civilians.

"But win for them doesn't look like a win for someone else.

For example, they ""win"" when the ACA goes away, because they've made the conscious decision that they would rather go without health care than risk one of their tax dollars going to someone who doesn't deserve it. People dying of treatable medical conditions because they don't make enough money to be considered worthy is the world they want to live in (even if it means they also don't get health care--many have directly said as much). But the people who will die when the ACA goes away lose. 

Whey gay marriages are invalidated, gay couples and their children lose big. But, evangelicals who think the mere existence of gay couples threatens their children win.

And on and on. Working together for the common good is a wildly outdated concept, because people's ideas of what's good for the society as a whole are radically opposed.

The rhetoric has been dialed to 11, the GOP is trying to consolidate power, but they have a TINY majority in the house, there is NO evidence that they cheated in the election, and you can bet the senate is going to push back on Trumps overreach including R’s.

But what if they don't want to?

That's when they dust off the little-known provision of the Constitution that (if the speaker of the house cooperates) allows the President to force the Senate to adjourn, and then he makes recess appointments.

"Project 2025 wants to ""ban"" porn. (I have no doubt they want to).

But porn was states rights issue until 1982 until a supreme court case against CSAM that gives the federal government the ability to set the age of performing and viewing.

I doubt Trump would federally ban it, instead leaving it to states. But that still would involve overturning that ruling, to do so.

And presumably that would bring back the previous filming ages in state laws?",2024_11_15,15_38_23

I, when I was 19 and drunk - decided to grab a bag of dirt from in front of a grocery store and run with it yelling ""Free the earth"" or something equally as stupid. Whatever, I got arrested and did my year of probation and community service for a 3 dollar bag of dirt. I can totally accept that I was dumb and made a mistake, life goes on.

Fast forward to about 7 years ago - I got invited on a cruise to Alaska, cool - I've been on one before a couple years earlier and sure, why not - it's a beautiful trip. 

With my family, we wait to get on the boat - go through the border/customs/whatever - wife gets in, kid gets in, I get pulled aside for ""additional screening"". 

After a whack of questioning and me basically being like... I don't get what the big deal is here, I've travelled AND conducted business in the US for years without problems. 

I got denied because of a crime of ""moral turpitude"" - stealing a bag of dirt. Theft is considered a crime of moral turpitude - fine, I'm not arguing that. 

Looking at what generally constitutes the crimes considered as ""crimes of moral turpitude"":

* Fraud: This includes crimes like theft by deception, forgery, and identity theft.
* Larceny: This involves the unlawful taking of someone else's property, such as robbery, burglary, and shoplifting.
* Intent to harm persons or things: This encompasses crimes like murder, assault, kidnapping, and arson.

> The Court ruled Burdick was entitled to reject the pardon for a number of reasons, including the implicit admission of guilt and possibly objectionable terms contained in a conditional pardon. As Burdick was entitled to reject the pardon, he was also entitled to assert his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment.

> Although the Supreme Court’s opinion stated that a pardon carries “an imputation of guilt and acceptance of a confession of it,”[1] this was part of the Court’s dictum for the case.[3] Whether the acceptance of a pardon constitutes an admission of guilt by the recipient is disputed. In Lorance v.

"I asked ChatGPT if it could provide a list of every Trump scandal since he announced in 2016.  I lost it at the first line.

Response follows:

Listing every Donald Trump scandal in full chronological order is challenging due to the volume, variations in impact, and differing definitions of what constitutes a “scandal.” However, here is an organized list of some of the more notable controversies that occurred throughout Trump’s career, divided into several phases:

1. Business and Pre-2016 Scandals. 

	•	1970s–1980s: Housing Discrimination Lawsuits
In 1973, the Department of Justice sued Trump Management for allegedly discriminating against Black applicants for housing. Trump settled without admitting wrongdoing.  
	•	1989: Central Park Five
Trump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty against five Black and Latino teenagers accused of assault in Central Park. They were later exonerated by DNA evidence, but Trump continued to maintain their guilt.  
	•	1991: Bankruptcy Filings
Over the years, Trump’s businesses declared bankruptcy six times, primarily related to his casinos, starting in 1991. Critics claimed these filings allowed him to avoid debts without personal financial impact.  
	•	2005: Trump University
Trump University, a for-profit business that purportedly taught real estate investing, led to multiple lawsuits and a $25 million settlement in 2016, resolving fraud claims.  
	•	2005: “Access Hollywood” Tape
In a tape released in 2016, Trump was heard making crude comments about women, claiming that he could “grab them by the [genitals]” due to his fame. The release led to significant public outcry.  

2. 2016 Presidential Campaign Scandals. 

	•	2015: Comments on Mexican Immigrants
During his campaign announcement, Trump referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and criminals, sparking widespread criticism.  
	•	2016: Trump Foundation The Trump Foundation, Trump’s charitable organization, faced accusations of self-dealing and using funds for personal expenses. It was dissolved in 2018, and Trump agreed to pay $2 million in damages.  
	•	2016: Russian Interference U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia attempted to interfere in the election in Trump’s favor. This led to investigations into his campaign’s possible collusion with Russia, though Mueller’s report did not find conclusive evidence of criminal conspiracy.  
	•	2016: Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal Payments Allegations surfaced that Trump directed his then-attorney Michael Cohen to pay hush money to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal to prevent stories about alleged affairs from surfacing. Cohen later went to prison for campaign finance violations.  

3. Presidency (2017–2021). 

	•	2017: Muslim Ban
Trump’s executive order banning travel from several Muslim-majority countries was criticized as discriminatory and faced legal challenges. Eventually, a revised version was upheld by the Supreme Court.  
	•	2017: Charlottesville Remarks
Following a violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump stated there were “very fine people on both sides,” which was widely condemned as equivocal on white supremacy.  
	•	2017: Comey Firing and Obstruction Allegations
Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, leading to accusations of obstruction of justice amid investigations into Russian election interference.  
	•	2018: Family Separation Policy
Under Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy, thousands of migrant children were separated from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border. The policy drew strong criticism both domestically and internationally.  
	•	2019: Ukraine Call and First Impeachment
Trump’s 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky led to an impeachment inquiry. Trump was accused of pressuring Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden in exchange for military aid. The House impeached him, but he was acquitted by the Senate.  
	•	2020: COVID-19 Response
Trump faced widespread criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, downplaying the virus, and making statements contradicting health experts. He was criticized for minimizing the threat even as cases surged in the U.S.  
	•	2020: Lafayette Square Incident
In June 2020, law enforcement forcibly cleared peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square near the White House, allowing Trump to walk to a nearby church for a photo-op, which was widely criticized.  

4. Post-2020 Election Scandals. 

	•	2020: Election Fraud Claims
Following the 2020 election, Trump claimed widespread fraud, leading to numerous lawsuits, all of which failed to overturn the results. His rhetoric fueled mistrust and led to the January 6 attack.  
	•	2021: January 6 Capitol Riot and Second Impeachment Trump’s rhetoric about election fraud was seen as contributing to the violent attack on the Capitol by his supporters. The House impeached him for “incitement of insurrection,” but the Senate again acquitted him.  

5. Post-Presidency (2021-Present).   

	•	2021-2022: Mar-a-Lago Classified Documents
The FBI recovered classified documents from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence. He faced accusations of mishandling sensitive information, leading to investigations that continue.  
	•	2023: New York Criminal Charges
In 2023, Trump was indicted on multiple charges, including alleged campaign finance violations related to hush-money payments. This marked the first time a former U.S. president faced criminal charges.  
	•	2023: Classified Documents and Federal Charges Trump faced additional federal charges for alleged mishandling of classified documents and obstruction. These are part of ongoing investigations and may lead to further legal consequences.  

This is a high-level overview of many of the most prominent issues; there are additional accusations, controversies, and lawsuits throughout Trump’s career, especially surrounding his businesses and post-presidential actions.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

#MASSIVE AIR QUOTES
 
Just because the previous admin will follow the law and not provide transition does not mean this shitstain is somehow not going to be sworn in as POTUS. The constitution says ABC and ABC was met, trump is gonna be POTUS and hes gonna bitch and moan that Biden didnt provide him any transition, conveniently leaving out that Biden was barred by law because of trumps gross incompetence and obvious malicious intent. 
 
And his base will eat it up. Joe will go down in history as the president who lost the union to trump, and we may never have another election.

"> Apparently our whole democracy was built on “everyone else has done it so you should too” and Trump is like, “nah, I’m good” and now we’re left with no checks on his power because no one else bothered to actually make things required.

America desperately needs to embrace what is standard in other democracies:

If you try to fuck with process, it just usually triggers an election.

Try to shutdown the government? It triggers an election.

Break certain requirements for holding office? It triggers an election

Etc etc etc

This is standard boiler plate regulation in functional democracies; elections aren't some far off thing in a functional democracy, *they are  a weapon* that the public can and should use against those that fuck with their government.

This is why government shutdowns aren't a thing in other countries, because when a party *does* try to trigger one, all it accomplishes is forcing the whole government to hold a new general election until the result is a group of people who can actually work with each other and get things done.

This is why in other countries, its entirely possible for a head of state to be replaced in any given year...because there's processes in place to remove them quickly and easily if they step out of line from expected process, or fall out of favor during their term in such a way that public has no confidence in government; and starts a new general election.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

You are correct. Which is why most countries move away from presidential systems after their first dictatorship. Yeah, you read that correctly. Almost all countries with a presidential system, have fallen into a dictatorship.

This is why the prime minister + parliament model is so popular among functional democracies.

""presidential system"" is what the USA has, we are literally the *defining example* as the first government to ever even have a presidential system of government; so to be clear ""presidential system"" is like what we have currently in the USA, its a system of how we delegate power to the head of state. There are countries that have ""presidents"" as their official title but they do not operate under a ""presidential system"" of power distribution.

There are also countries where they have a president where the role is a ceremonial , or has limited procedural powers and they are basically meant to act in the same role as a US vice president; or where the powers we think of as ""presidential"" are divided between the president and the prime minster.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"Part 1 of 2:

""Donald Trump’s nomination of [Robert F Kennedy Jr](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr) as US secretary of health and human services has prompted widespread criticisms towards Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist who has embraced a slew of other debunked health-related conspiracy theories.

In a Truth Social post on Thursday, Trump claimed that Americans have been “crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies” and that Kennedy “will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!”

In response to Kennedy’s nomination, Public Citizen, a progressive nonprofit organization focusing on consumer advocacy, said: “Robert F Kennedy Jr is a clear and present danger to the nation’s health. He shouldn’t be allowed in the building at the department of health and human services (HHS), let alone be placed in charge of the nation’s public health agency.”

“Donald Trump’s bungling of public health policy during the Covid pandemic cost hundreds of thousands of lives. By appointing Kennedy as his secretary of HHS, Trump is courting another, policy-driven public health catastrophe,” the organization added.

Apu Akkad, an infectious disease physician at the University of Southern California, [called](https://x.com/ApuAkkad1/status/1857174303370014781) the announcement a “scary day for public health”.

“I’m saying this over and over – but it will be of the utmost importance to ONLY make public health decisions or changes based on robust evidence. I hope we have at least learned this much from Covid,” Akkad added on X.

The conservative pundit and lawyer George Conway also commented on Kenedy’s nomination, along with that of Tulsi Gabbard and Matt Gaetz.

“Very little of what Trump does these days amazes me. Any one of the last three of Trump’s Cabinet-level picks (Gabbard as DNI, Gaetz as AG, RFK Jr for HHS), standing alone, would arguably have been the worst in American history. The fact that Trump made all three in a span of roughly 24 hours is astonishing,” Conway [wrote](https://x.com/gtconway3d/status/1857171000414069186).

California’s Democratic representative Robert Garcia [called](https://x.com/RobertGarcia/status/1857166910195892435) the nomination “fucking insane”, writing on X: “He’s a vaccine denier and a tin foil hat conspiracy theorist. He will destroy our public health infrastructure and our vaccine distribution systems. This is going to cost lives.”",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"If they think he's bad then wait till they learn about Trump.

The Biden administration in consultation with the Department of Justice and the US Military need to be having a conversation about not handing over the reigns of power, based on everything they know about the threat Trump presents.

1. There is precedent from 2020 that you can just ignore the results of the election.
2. There is a ruling from the Supreme Court that the President can do whatever he wants in an official capacity.
3.  Biden took an oath which he actually believes in, and contains ""I further commit myself to defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic"" literally his job to protect the US from threats.

This is the ""if you could go back in time and stop baby hitler"" moment, without the need for time travel. 

Fucking sucks that this is even something that needs to be considered, I want to just be a good guy and follow the rules too, on the other hand trump is a RUSSIAN asset and couldn't give a fuck about the rules!

He's going to put into question the entire drug approval process. This will go way beyond just vaccines,2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Conclusion:

""Alastair McAlpine, a pediatric physician at British Columbia’s children’s hospital, [wrote](https://x.com/AlastairMcA30/status/1857166072476274704): “It is hard to overstate what a terrible decision this is. RFK Jr has no medical training. He is a hardcore anti-vaccine and misinformation peddler. The last time he meddled in a state’s medical affairs (Samoa), 83 children died of measles.”

[According to](https://www.factcheck.org/2023/08/scicheck-factchecking-robert-f-kennedy-jr/) [FactCheck.org](http://FactCheck.org), in 2018, two infants in Samoa died when nurses accidentally prepared the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine with an expired muscle relaxant instead of water. Following the infants’ deaths, the Samoan government temporarily suspended the vaccination program.

The temporary suspension prompted Kennedy and his anti-vaccine nonprofit Children’s Health Defense to reportedly [spread](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/how-rfk-jr-falsely-denied-his-connection-to-a-deadly-measles-outbreak-in-samoa/) various falsehoods about vaccinations across the island, in turn resulting in a drastic decline in vaccination rates.

A year later, a measles [outbreak](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/28/samoa-measles-outbreak-who-blames-anti-vaccine-scare-death-toll) on the island caused by a sick traveler ended up infecting more than 57,000 people and killing 83, including children.

In an interview for a documentary, Shot in the Arm, Kennedy said he bears no responsibility for the outcome.

On another health issue, Kennedy has said that Trump would push to eliminate fluoride from drinking water, a mineral that strengthens teeth and reduces cavities, [according to](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/rfk-jr-trump-remove-fluoride-drinking-water) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Throughout his own independent campaign trail, Kennedy has also touted the effectiveness of raw milk and ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug that has been [disproved ](https://emergency.cdc.gov/newsletters/coca/020122.htm)as a Covid cure. In addition to health-related conspiracies, Kennedy has admitted to decapitating a beached whale and [collecting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/15/rfk-jr-whale-beheading-federal-investigation) its head, and to [dumping ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/rfk-jr-kennedy-bear-story-central-park-new-york)a dead bear cub in New York City’s Central Park a decade ago because he did not have time to skin it and eat it later.

Kennedy has also [said](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/09/rfk-jr-brain-worms-biden-trump-debate) that he had a worm in his brain which “ate a portion of it and then died” and [vowed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/09/rfk-jr-brain-worms-biden-trump-debate) “to eat five more brain worms and still beat” Trump and Joe Biden in a staged debate earlier this year.""",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Call it a conspiracy all you want, but the fluoride industry is making billions off of the government putting fluoride in public drinking water. Of course there is going to be a lot of lobbying against stopping it, it makes someone a LOT of money.

“But there’s no transparency” about the harm of vaccines. To which I responded that there is a publicly available database  where people can report adverse events and have access to all the reported adverse events for every vaccine. 

She said “well, he says he’ll look at all the evidence and use that to make his decisions….” Like he has used this publicly available evidence to inform his incorrect, dangerous rhetoric to this point?

"***From Rolling Stone’s Nikki McCann Ramirez:***

President-elect Donald Trump is expected to nominate vaccine conspiracy theorist and failed presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services, according to a Thursday report from Politico.

Kennedy has already been meeting with members of Trump’s transition team in recent weeks, and has signaled that he will usher in a large-scale transformation of American health care if he’s appointed to a government role. It seems he will be.

Last week, Kennedy told The Washington Post that “the president has asked me to clean up corruption and conflicts at the agencies and to end the chronic disease epidemic.”

“He wants measurable results in two years and to return those agencies to their long traditions of gold-standard evidence-based science and medicine,” he added.

Kennedy also bragged at a separate event that Trump had promised him “control of the public health agencies, which are HHS and its sub-agencies, CDC, FDA, NIH, and a few others … and then also the USDA.”

The conspiracy theorist gained infamy as one of the most prominent peddlers of the false claim that vaccines are the root cause of Autism Spectrum Disorders. Kennedy has also suggested that vaccine research is responsible for the creation of diseases like AIDS, the Spanish Flu, and Lyme disease.

>Trump is doing what ALL Presidents/ Leaders should do; get the most (all together folks) QUALIFIED and WELL ORIENTED people to do the job.

As it's marked Flaired only, I can't respond. I cannot understand how it was determined that he is the ""most well qualified"" person for this. He is not a doctor. He is not a professor of Medicine. He does not have professional credentials that justify his appointment. His views are also not ""well oriented"" to demonstrably verifiable scientific consensus. He just echoed a lot of weird shit and conspiracies regarding vaccines and water treatment. 

One of the worst aspects of all this is just the sheer dishonesty on display. I believe they in fact mean that he is the most well-qualified to destroy and dismantle the HHS. Loosening vaccine requirements will end up with children being buried. It's contrary to a ""pro-life"" stance.

Conservatives, I'd like your input. I can understand he may hold some values you may agree with regarding health, even if they are untrue or ridiculous to me. But sum total, I'd find it impossible to justify calling him ""the most qualified"".

Another is that he hates a lot of these people and even a large portion of his own supporters hate them, meaning they literally can’t disobey him unless they want to get fired and get a target painted on their backs with MAGA. 

Lastly, because all of these people are idiots, and easy-to-hate idiots at that, they will be criticized by people all around, giving Trump cover for some of that scrutiny himself. If anything goes wrong with his plans, he not only has dems and liberals to shift blame onto, but subordinates as well. People who no one will object to him firing.

House Republicans now have nearly the same majority as last session, when they needed votes from Democrats to keep the government open.

It gets into power, it begins to veer further and further to the left, it finally capsizes completely, and then -- after some time in the wilderness -- some young Democrat enters the fray and resets the whole party. This is exactly what happened all through the 1980s after they lost to Reagan, and then Bill Clinton and the DLC moved them toward the center and they started to win again -- basically by co-opting some Republican issues, like welfare reform and putting more police on the street. I don't blame far leftists -- because they are what they are and they can't help themselves -- but the United States is just not a left-wing country, either economically or socially. It's a mildly right-wing country that the Democrats persuade every now and then when the Right screws up. Focusing on questions of race and gender obsessively, policing language and thought, abandoning expressions of patriotism, denigrating merit and religion and traditional values is a recipe for disaster, because most working class people are small-c conservative in terms of their lifestyle and worldview (especially Hispanics). Most people in the United States want good economic stewardship and a projection of strength abroad, and when a party starts embracing radical social views, the people get seriously concerned about their ability to manage nuts-and-bolts affairs like spurring economic growth. That's how the social stuff and the economic stuff bleed into one another. Yes, the Democrats lost because of the price of eggs. But it's not JUST the price of eggs. It's a lack of faith that cost of living is the thing that interests the Democrats most, and a lack of belief that they have a plan to address that issue and related issues.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

This doesn't mean abandoning at risk minorities. It means talking about how Democratic policies will be good for everybody--especially the working class.

MAYBE a child tax credit or new home owner credit helps an individual or their family. Maybe it doesn't. But even if it does, it FEELS like a pandering giveaway. If it's good messaging, it is easy to understand, is not targeted at a specific group, and *feels* like the ""hand up, not hand out."" Look at Everybody Counts in Kentucky. It is good policy, easily accessible to a wide variety of people, and easy to understand with simple messaging, and has multiple paths for higher education and basic post-high school employment alike.

Yes, the basket of deplorables may be a real thing, and sure, misogyny and racism impacted Harris at the margins (and certainly in the deep MAGA base who won't be voting Democratic regardless), but if you see a country-wide shift in attitudes across virtually all demos, as we did this election, and just come back to ""it's all racism/misogyny/trans-hate/whatever"" you are burying your head in the sand.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Everything over the last 20-30 years has drastically escalated in price (College degree, housing, rent, cost of living etc) while work has gotten worse across the board. Less viable careers, more competition, less benefits etc.

He’s saying that you need to have really clear messaging without all the numbers or extras, making it clear that you care about the things people care about. That way if you support other things that not everyone does (religious freedoms, trans rights, etc) people will still support you because they feel you care. 

Democrats get bogged down in numbers and policies and details because they’re responsible adults and are answering the hard questions, but then those don’t stick.

3m new homes is a valiant goal that will be bogged down by inflation and nimbyism.

Start 3D printing cute animals and put a different one on the podium each time. Pay some Tik Toker's to notice it. Wear a suit color someone will rant about, and then an even more outrageous color the next time once it's being talked about. Give away a dishwasher or something to a random member of the public who attends, and proudly announce it's campaign financed. Post about the mystery word of the day and ask people to spot it.

Do literally *anything* to ensure the media is talking about the crazy thing *you're doing* and holding panels and briefings talking about *you* and not wanting to talk about how you relate to your opponent.

The media would lose its fucking mind over how outrageous this is, but suddenly Trump isn't as interesting as whatever thing is going to happen next.

Its Ragebait,  he ragebaits and ragebaits until that one thing stick. And what do u know great timing. 

Guarantee that majority of men and women boomers in the usa don't vote women. I'm sorry I don't want to assume someone's cism.  But I really do believe the fact she was a woman made all these Puerto rifan conservatives and probably women to. Pop out . And yes economy. But I believe the men being afraid to be like in the gym looking at a girl getting taking away tk #MeTooGulag. As so the populist have foretold. 
The sexism * I think u are bicism because u do have some serious systematic cisms* it's OK u can come out now.  

just something  I today do not find strange to say. I have given up on women ever being respected as fully part of this society of the west. We shouldn't even try to fight this. While we still can ( Not saying it's over) we have to ramp up women investors. And companies. But who am I kidding. Women here have only been allowed to gain capital and work for money since 1950 or so. There's no old money there. 

Besides all the unrecognised scientists that slowly are recognised . The fact most of women were not allowed schoold. We were not allowed to work. Still women found a way in a mans world *where im sure many egos did not recognise women* . And still men just say shit. She mist have  done a bj. The joke has been made eternally, its oiterally ancient.And it does hold more power because it became especially today almost kneejerk reactions. 

 I love dark jokes. Well timed. But it'd continously and getting more darker than ever. And they are matching actual politics all around us. u know what we learned. To swallow our pride. To wait . To know when the right time is. But women in western society were either rich or were totally looked and walked by as worthless. Working their ass off. And being a thrrapist and angerment manager to some. But as u can see. Women are obviously the ones that know what battle u should or shouldn't pick. If she   trust  herself.Women don't respect themselves either. So the confidence in intution is lost. 
Men say weak weak women. 
And I ask hey if u have been Sa , do u break the shame to come forward? Yet u blame  women for not being heard? 

  If u were wrong shouting of the towers , do u dare to admit fault ?
who back in history guides thousands of people's into their deaths over a misguided mistake. Yes women ain't Angels. Far from. Women don't take enough risks, men take too much.Women needs to have some wind under her wings. Men need to be stopped sometimes. Then it becomes normal to learn from each other. And we can again socialise . 

No women bad. Muslim come for our women. *I just assume the videos going around to teens* women want to brainwash your gender away. Uuughhh

Anyways where was I 
If your voting nrs aren't fake. However nobody seems to contest it . And we know yall silly American Reddit gooses want to. See there though we eu really got it down. Right Italy? Girl power Chica! 🙄
 ah America the one place I could vent. The sort of reflection of what we will become *if you still believe the Internet archives.  U then an see We do what u do. In some shape or forn. Just less extreme.

who is unfortunately smarter than Trump. These populist here really are here smarter. Or not.  Maybe Trump knew the algorithm. *conspiracy heaven. . Agorhitmm with slurs repeated. Boom the nazi robots come. Ok **** stop brain. I now see a nazi AI which...if the usa came with this shit. I bet there's a nazi ai . Man this timeline. I feel like how people must have felt when they believed thunder was an angry God. But that was simpler. Tbf I'm not surprised the whole attempt to manipulate is more insidious then we know. *so since all is possible.  Or Trump actually is showing with elon and hulk hogan he's going to plant flowers and trees and the world follows. 

But them being smarterthat  id that dcares me. However working together. Its going to be interssting in the european parlement. Becausen now more organised countries seem to  join the chaos. With a cabinet that is looking over their shoulder continously on both sides. Because like Trum.Ours slowly testing out the waters. Becoming his final form. 
we also got netyanhu enjoying ours so much and  jumping in to safe the jews/hooligans from the other shit face asshole hooligans.Nope we got to make it about religion in amsterdamb(wasnt he busy?) . Seeminglyndl for dramatic effect. Making a spectacle with Israeli police or wtf?  We are potentially being sucked into this Israel bussines hard. 
I so hope wilders is trying to get a bj  or tweet session with Trump this way. The republicans and democrats clearly both want him out. And gets into the old boys club. And that Trump goes down  And that this will be the end of wilders. And our whole reputation.  And thus economy. And he will blame the left 😊 not the end. 

Populist and tech is temporary taking over. It's their last chance. And Europeans don't have the same tech as the usa.  Once it's ai controlled and we dont move away from the usa. Conservatife Internet raised populist are coming. I can't wait . We still have a chance to stop it now. Maybe its not needed but ladies fight. Don't fight framing.Stop debating what we know is true. I still believe half of the men can be with us. But when we are pushed out of government.  That's when we have to worry. *or the ones I don't want to even name . Some Women politicians. I cannot write words. I just feel 🤢 

Come on,we should learn to recognise the pattern in relations to ai and data overload and repetition our own use to avoid algorithms. Tech is a tool to enhance not to replace. This is where we fuck up our brains rewiring.facts . If we could only just manage this. If we could possibly just  only force two day with people's agreement. That one day in a whole nation for a year
 I bet we had flying cars(which we so badly still want? Or?Can u imagine Karen flying behind you?) 

If we did  this for a year for a week per month. I bet we were talking to orcas to catch us fish and Germans would have a funny joke. We would have peace about the pineapple pizza affairs. Respect harambe. And we would make the Internet human again. By leaving it. It's nothing human to it. If not used in proper supportive ways *says I the prophet of proper Internet use - read verse hypocrite 1

Edit: I'm so feminsiticaly angry the side of me I hate.But I have given up .I can officially declare that there are good men. The men in power and conservatives around growing again into power. It will be the same shit over again. We were not even allowed school,  work, whatever the fuck. And some men say but u women are naturally home people or work your ass of inthe farm pls&take care of the kids machines. Without women ,yall just kill each other? Or have u now evolved men ? Because doesn't seem like it. And teens u aren't focking toxic. I didn't die walking by u guys.

Eggs are expensive, how is price gouging protection addressing that? When I asked family members what they thought price gouging was, they all thought it was things like ""hidden fees from ticketmaster"".

* The stock market is up. That's neat, but many americans don't benefit from this in a clear way. Stocks being up makes rich people and investment firms richer. Tell me why that's good for my paycheck.

* Job security, particularly as it relates to immigration. This should've been a slam dunk for democrats and they did horrible at it. There's a very popular fear from people, particularly in unions, that undocumented immigrants are going to take away jobs. The campaign messaging was ""there's room for all of us!

Send Walz onto Rogan, have Tim and Joe ""bro out"" for a couple hours while they talk about stuff (football, food, politics, whatever, etc...), and you can give Rogan's male Gen Z listeners an example of a Democratic politician they can hopefully get into voting for.

Bernie actually went on Rogan's podcast years ago, when Bernie was preparing for his 2020 presidential run. You can have a look at it on YouTube here. It's actually... kind of pleasant?

"I remember [this article in 2017](https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/23/news/donald-trump-resigns-business/index.html) which speaks a bit more clearly as to the limitations on the actual rules which is why government is limited in what it can require of Trump regarding his businesses. The gov had 4 years to address this and they clearly haven’t. Also, I am interpreting that he has until he is sworn in to address these items. So instead of fixing the issue the gov knew about 4 years ago, they appear to once again be bitching to we the ppl to stir contempt. I prefer action to bitching, personally. 

Also I get there is no trust for trump but if we keep customizing rules like this it could dissuade future qualified candidates from running as president which hurts America in the long run. I have confidence that if trump breaks the law, the media will do as they have been in demonstrating the government’s inability to update their own rules/laws. The government appears the source of the issues here and they aren’t explaining themselves well why they keep bitching to the ppl and throwing shade instead of taking action.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Also, if Trump believes he won fairly AND won by this much, don't you think he'd be in front of cameras every minute telling us how wonderful and popular he is and how America loves him? His relative silence on his win is another telling sign that it wasn't legitimate.

The law is structured as a voluntary deal. It is a ""you sign these documents and increase transparency on your transition and inauguration committees, and we give you... a whole bunch of stuff like office space, paid salaries, security briefings, etc etc etc.

Almost every single service requires you to sign those disclosures and increase transparency. But, the law does NOT require the apparent President-elect to do it.

Yes, you're right. We can accept that the media landscape isn't in our favor and just bend over and take it, or we can try to do something about it. If we know media silos are the problem and that the bottom fell out with non-college working class voters, then it seems the best place to start is (1) not a run a 2008 campaign where you just jump from national news to national news and spam rallies preaching to the choir, and instead utilize your assets such as your billion dollars raised and Tim Walz who can speak to guns and sports and go into the smaller media silos and places like Joe Rogan. Additionally, (2) You take that billion dollars and start *educating* the electorate and influencing where they are. I've been saying it for years, but if you have a growing education problem in America, the only solution is more teachers. The vast majority of money would be better spent using ad-buys and talk-show time re-teaching Americans the fundamentals of civics, dispelling myths, teaching pieces of critical-thinking and showing examples of fallacies one piece at a time. Lies told often enough become true; but telling the truth often enough *also* becomes true. Not saying it's perfect, but it's the only option we've got unless we keep letting the blind lead the blind. So activism in the off-season is key. 

But look, ultimately I don't blame the Harris campaign too much. If they had more than 3 months, maybe they would've done this. The blame for this loss falls much more on Biden for not committing to stepping down sooner; as well as the DNC who did not see the writing on the wall when both pre and post-2024 primaries, 2/3 of Democrats and the majority of Independents wanted someone else. 

What I know doesn't work is playing into the hand of Republican narratives that only further shifts what is defined as ""center"" in the [Overton Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) as more rightward. That's a losing game.

Democrats need to actually stand up for something because they'll otherwise always just be perceived as a weaker, less authentic version of Republicans. As a result, their own base of supporters will sit out, be unenthused, while Republicans will attract people because they are at least committed to a vision.

Edit: I'm generally not an accelerationist, but we just lost everything running your playbook against one of what senior Democrats once perceived as the weakest Republican candidate.

Reddit melted down when Trump ran for president the first time because they worried about a republican SCOTUS. And sure enough, they've struck down Roe v Wade as expected. I've watched Florida do everything reddit worried Republicans would do and seen the political theater that ends up laying out the groundwork for hate and xenophobia.

"Why are so many of you so quickly accepting the vote tallies? A guy who still claims 2020 was stolen wins in a highly unusual manner that bucks all historical voting data and wins SEVEN swing states and there are hundreds of thousands of odd split ballots and nine days after the election you want to move on?

Bomb threats in PA, voting machines tampered with in Wisconsin, Musk being all over the place in PA, the ""I don't need your vote"" boast from Trump himself. ALSO, if Trump did legitimately win by such a margin, don't you think he'd be in front of the cameras non-stop bragging about how popular he is? He's trying to move us away from recounts in the swing states by picking horrible Cabinet members and shifting the narrative to outrage over that.

What about the Polymarket CEO being arrested by the FBI? Thiel is heavily tied to that company.

We need to stop blaming Harris, Biden or the Democrats. We need to call for recounts in every swing state. The split ballot numbers are highly suspect.

Look at NC, for example. A traditional red state. Trump wins by 190,000...but Jackson the Democrat AG wins by 150,000? Yeah, that's highly suspect. And it happened in numerous states. NO WAY did all of those rural RED Republicans show up in NC and only vote for the president OR vote for a raging lunatic Republican for president, then say, ""But locally, within NC, yeah, I trust this Democrat guy to run things well."" That doesn't happen. And it doesn't happen across numerous swing states in the same election.

I don't buy the election results for a second. And I'm not sure why so many of you are as well. I'm calling for a close examination of the votes, I'm calling for a closer look at places where bomb threats happened. This is different than just saying, ""They must have cheated!"" This is saying the voting numbers in numerous swing states look HIGHLY unusual, so let's do a recount and see.

"FWIW, Thune has said that each appointee will get normal confirmation hearings and votes as long as the Democrats don't obstruct or block the hearings. The hearings can be filibustered, so I think that's what he's referring to.

Let's assume that, barring the Pennsylvania recount changing anything, the Senate is R 53-47 D. The VP (Vance) breaks ties. So, in order for an appointee to be rejected, 4 Republicans need to vote against them. For AG, Collins and Murkowski seem likely to vote no, and I'm betting that Utah Senator-elect John Curtis will do the same. That leaves 1 Republican senator to cross the aisle.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

There are a lot of establishment republicans or else Thune wouldn’t have won. That just might be the only hope to prevent the most stupid appointees announced so far but the track record so far indicates that might not matter If Trump makes a big stinky in his diaper about one asshole he “appointed” or another.

A lawyer representing a woman accusing former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) of having sex with her when she was a minor is pressing the House Ethics Committee to release a report on their investigation into the allegations despite Gaetz’s resignation from Congress.

On Wednesday, Gaetz tendered his resignation after President-elect Donald Trump tapped the Florida congressman to serve as his attorney general. The resignation came days before the Ethics Committee was scheduled to vote on the release of an investigative report into allegations that he had engaged in sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, and public corruption.

And good riddance.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
"I think this is the play. Gaetz gets to resign from the house and avoid consequences of the investigation. When he doesn’t get confirmed by the senate, trump can just say “welp I tried” and then put someone else up. Gaetz walks out of there free from consequences as a thank you for being a loyal trump sycophant.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Ok that’s horribly funny. I feel bad for laughing, but here we are",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"At least she had experience with a kid for a little while. That’s more experience than his current picks. 

I can’t believe I actually thought about this.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
Terrible,2024_11_15,15_38_23
McCarthy should be leaking the report to each senator personally. Get Gaetz to perjure himself.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
not voting republican last week.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
"If it's any consolation, it's because they are afraid of Trump. Trump represents a threat to their own power, Gaetz doesn't. They are more than happy to stab him in the back and I don't see Trump going to bat for Gaetz.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
">but we're talking about the same people outraged after Jan 6 who then quickly refused to remove Trump during impeachment. 

That's not really what happened. 

7 Republicans did vote to impeach him. The only reason he didn't get impeached, as admitted by Mitch McConnell, was that he was no longer in office and they didn't believe it made sense to impeach a past president

It looks like the Senate is 53-47 right now, so they'd need 4 to vote no",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Fair points.  But keep in mind some of the GOP Senators are eye balling retirement and hate Trump.  Collins, Murkowski are centrists and voted for impeachment.  Cassidy also voted for impeachment.  That’s 3 probably wont vote for him.  Only need 1 more.  If any pedo stuff comes out, Gaetz is toast.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
">when they personally will have little to gain. 

I disagree with this. In 4 years the Republicans need to shift the party to someone other than trump. I'm expecting a handful of Republicans to try and be the standout anti-trump Republicans, similar to what Romney/McCain/murkowski/Collins have all done in the past",2024_11_15,15_38_23
This is to setup nominating Ken Paxton to make him seem more palatble.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
Big fucking check there...,2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Look I will be so happy if I'm wrong about this. But I think the few republicans who did vote to impeach did it precisely because his term was already over anyway. I don't buy Mitch's justification at all, and I don't think they've grown enough spine to stand up to him just after winning an election. In fact I think they've lost any resemblance of a spine since then. I do not think them speaking out is an indication they wont confirm, more them begging for Trump not to put them into this position. Maybe we'll get a few like Romney to vote no, but (and again I want to be wrong about this) I think in the end they give Trump whatever he wants.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"So...the bottom line was they did NOT impeach him. Period. Regardless of the reason, they did not do it.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"If it was just Gaetz, I’d agree. But nearly every single one of these picks is so batshit that it’s like Trump is daring the Senate to block them all. Sure they’re nearing retirement, but are they going to want to spend the rest of that time with a MAGA target on their back?",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Romney and probably McConnell. I don’t think it would come down to where they are on the political spectrum. I could see a super conservative like Lankford being disgusted by this pick too.

Edit: not Romney, I thought he would still be in the senate for this but I was incorrect.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"While the GOP will need to shift to someone other than Trump, there’s no reason to think it’s going to be anti-Trump. Didn’t Murkowski have to run as an independent because she lost the Republican primary to someone Trump endorsed? Sure, she won, but all of these senators are basically going to have to become independents to survive this. 

The way I see it is that, by ramping up the insanity so quickly, Trump is forcing the rest of the party to go all-in on him or all-in against him. There’s no “putting the brakes on” and coming out unscathed. We are fully in train wreck territory. 

Sure, they might all vote not to confirm Gaetz. But what about Tulsi Gabbard, Kristi Noem, Pete Hegseth, and now fucking RFK jr? Are they going to vote not to confirm any of these yahoos?",2024_11_15,15_38_23

So yes, for the millionth time, he WAS impeached.  Fully impeached.  100 percent impeached. Full stop.  But he was not *convicted*. 


FFS we need some better civics education in school.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

The US payed the most but also got to utilise its vast military industrial complex to sell its weaponry to its allies therefore probably outweighing the difference in member funding. Now all that has been achieved is that the rest of the west will move away from the US and hopefully speed up our own defence industries as no US military secrets will be confidential post January, whether you’re MAGA, Center or left leaning the prospect of that is or should be terrifying.

*[Great Molasses Flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Molasses_Flood)*

>The Great Molasses Flood, also known as the Boston Molasses Disaster, was a disaster that occurred on Wednesday, January 15, 1919, in the North End neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.

>A large storage tank filled with 2.3 million U.S. gallons (8,700 cubic meters) of molasses, weighing approximately 13,000 short tons (12,000 metric tons) burst, and the resultant wave of molasses rushed through the streets at an estimated 35 miles per hour (56 kilometers per hour), killing 21 people and injuring 150. The event entered local folklore and residents reported for decades afterwards that the area still smelled of molasses on hot summer days.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"I think the majority of the blame actually belongs to Nixon. 

Nixon opened the door to a few things: authoritarian-conservative appeal born out of an appeal to law and order during the Civil Rights and anti-Vietnam war era protests, pushing for a right wing news source to balance out what he and his admin viewed liberally biased mainstream news that later became Fox News, and ironically his main pitfall (Watergate) leading us down the path of being anti-establishment/Washington Outsider being seen as a good thing. After Nixon-Ford you have Carter, the friendly peanut farmer from Georgia, Reagan the all smiles movie actor, H.W. Bush continuing Reagan’s legacy and sort of a friendly grandfatherly figure, and even Clinton as the once slick southern white boy who grew up in a working class home. G.W. Bush going out of his way to emphasize his southern drawl and intentionally talking with a middle school vocabulary. Heck even Obama being seen as fresh blood in many ways.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"To be fair, I don’t see people actually talking like that in the US. I’m in the suburbs so maybe am protected from it. I lived in a small red town during Trump’s presidency and I didn’t hear people talking like that then either…I do see the social media comments calling liberals communists from time to time, and that has been a far right talking point for years and I don’t really think represents any kind of majority. Most of my family are liberals, but even my republican family members don’t have any problems with gay people and don’t even care about that. There is a very outspoken against gay marriage guy in my local Facebook group, and I don’t see him getting a lot of likes and people just argue with him. He’s not even Christian, he’s Jewish. 

So I don’t know, at the end of the day people are complex and I wouldn’t judge our whole country based on this. Most of the hardcore conservative people are in rural areas and many of us closer to the city don’t even have contact with those people. Also the evangelical christians, who also stick with their own group. One of my closest friends who I talk to everyday lives in the UK, she is from there but lived over here for several years and just recently moved back. Leading up to the election I was freaking out and messaging her, and in regards to trump she said “well anyone will be better than Biden.” Her and her husband (also born and raised in the UK) want to move back to the US and are trying to get him transferred back…not because of politics, but because they miss having a larger yard and more space.

""If anything, we should be abolishing a lot of the agencies at the federal level like the Department of Education, like the EPA and sending that power back to our state governments.""

First of all, you just resigned in disgrace in order to kill the ethics committee investigation against you after hearing that it's going to vote to release a damning report that implicates you in multiple crimes and/or serious ethical violations.

And make no mistake, the party of ""limited government,"" can be more accurately described as the party that wants to limit the government to *their* authority.

Using the power of the federal government to address human trafficking is bad. But when a MAGA coalition threatens to use the power of the federal government to create a one party system that will eliminate independent agencies that are responsible for public health, clean water, air and environmental preservation is good?

And that last part there is no exaggeration. Republicans are going to abuse their authority come January 21st to do exactly what Gaetz suggests. 

We've been warned by political analysts and junkies that a second trump administration will bring about a crisis of incompetence at every level of government 

Through executive actions like schedule F, combined with a unitary executive and broad immunities for the president, the Republican party will endeavor to create a one-party system of government.

The goal is to eliminate the separation of powers and the independence of most government agencies, cleansing these agencies of anyone who is not on board with the MAGA/Trump coalition agenda, then filling whatever positions are left with loyalists, and these are positions that were previously reserved for educated, non-partisan, knowledgeable professionals and experts in their respected fields. Hence, a ""crisis of incompetence.""",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Task & Purpose - [Opinion: Project 2025 would slash veterans’ hard-earned benefits](https://taskandpurpose.com/opinion/opinion-project-2025-slash-benefits/)

Rolling Stone - [Project 2025 Would Be a Disaster for Veterans](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-project-2025-veterans-1235080922/)

Democracy Forward - [The People’s Guide to Project 2025](https://democracyforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-05_Peoples-Guide-Pro-2025.pdf) (PDF; Page 14)

“**Limit which disabilities qualify veterans for benefits.** The authors of Project 2025 think that too many veterans qualify for disability benefits.

Disability benefits are often critical lifelines for veterans who became disabled as a result of their military service - and can be the difference between a veteran being able to put food on the table or not

Project 2025 proposes to have the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs cut costs by having fewer health conditions qualify veterans for disability benefits - a proposal could greatly restrict disabled veterans’ access to life-sustaining benefits.

From Mandate for Leadership p. 649-650” 

Fulcrum - [Project 2025: The Department of Veterans Affairs](https://thefulcrum.us/governance-legislation/project-2025-veterans)

“Both the Democratic and Republican parties also generally demonstrate strong support for veterans and their benefits. However, both parties still debate specific policy implementation and budget allocation. The Republican Party has expressed a preference for moving to a public-private partnership to administer many veterans benefits, while (most of) the Democratic Party favors investing in public infrastructure to meet VA mandates.”

“For the quarter ending March 2024, 80.4 percent of veterans expressed trust in the VA, with 91.8 percent specifically trusting VA health services.”

“However, multiple systematic reviews comparing VA and non-VA health care outcomes show that the VHA generally provides equal or better quality care, particularly regarding mortality rates and in safety, equity, and specific surgical and clinical outcomes.”

“A recent audit by the VA Office of Inspector General concurred and highlighted concerns that increased spending on community care could erode the VA’s direct care system and limit choice for veterans who prefer VA services. It warned that diverting funds from the VA to private care could reduce the quality of direct VA care.”

Defeat Project 2025 - [Veterans](https://defeatproject2025.org/issues/veterans/)

“Project 2025 proposes that the VA reduce expenses by cutting benefits while funneling a larger fraction of its current budget into the pockets of private contractors. It proposes a personnel policy of replacing the leadership and decision makers with political appointees, while outsourcing core functions and silencing dissent from existing staff. It mixes policies from the current VA strategic plan with a dangerous vein of reduced benefits, corporate plundering, and politicization.” 

Raw Story - [Project 2025 will rob veterans and active duty troops of billions in benefits](https://www.rawstory.com/project-2025-veterans/)

“Among other recommendations, the plan proposes eliminating concurrent eligibility for both service-related disability benefits and military retirement benefits, which Tucker says would reduce mandatory outlays by at least $160 billion through 2032, and revising the disability rating awards that determine eligibility for benefits and determine monthly disability compensation to reap ‘significant cost savings.’

The plan also proposes to end enrollment in VA medical care for veterans in two low-priority groups to save an estimated $69 billion through 2032 and narrow eligibility for veterans disability by excluding disabilities that cannot be related to military service, which would save an estimated $37.6 billion during that same period.”

Government Executive - [Project 2025: The worst-case scenario for veterans](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/07/project-2025-worst-case-scenario-veterans/397874/)

“Veterans make up roughly 30% of the federal workforce, with approximately 300,000 veterans currently employed by the federal government.”

“Many of these veterans, including a substantial number who are disabled, find employment in agencies that Project 2025 targets for elimination, such as the FBI and the Justice Department.”

“By suggesting a 50% reduction in federal employees within a year and 75% within four years, Project 2025 is essentially advocating for a skeletal government, unable to perform its fundamental functions.”

“By dismantling key agencies and slashing federal jobs, Project 2025 risks undermining not only government efficiency but also the livelihoods of tens of thousands of veterans. These actions will have far-reaching consequences, weakening the very fabric of our nation’s administrative capabilities, betraying our veterans, and damaging the economy to prove a twisted point. We must ask ourselves what is more important: the livelihoods of our veterans and the health of our economy, or the whims of the few who want to dismantle the government.”",2024_11_15,15_38_23

In his letters to John Adams and Patrick Henry he expresses that more soldiers were dying of wounds and illness than on the battlefield.

The formula was literally just some variation of text saying “no money for illegal aliens/student loan forgiveness until every veteran is taken care of” overlaid on an AI generated image that looks like the prompt was “sad/sick old war veteran”.  There were hundreds of accounts doing this for awhile. 

Generate 50 of those and post 3 or 4 a day. Most won’t get noticed but 1 gets shared by angry boomer whose network a starts commenting and suddenly instead of 5 comments and 20 shares it’s got 5000 comments and 40000 shares. 

Now you have more followers and the algorithm promotes you so your post are even more likely to do big numbers. 

Now you think this is for political gain right? 

Nope. I saw a page whose only activity was posting this shit and thirst trap reels promoting the Instagram account of an onlyfans performer. 

Posting politically divisive AI slop because it increases the reach of the thirst trap reels used to sell porn or increase the reach of some gaming influencer or some weird niche lifestyle influencer. 

And it works so well. People uncritically eat that shit up and signal boost it. 

And you can kind a look back through the history of these pages and see how what worked over time and how they all settled in on the “take care of our veterans” format.

There'll be direct impacts like cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, food stamps, unemployment and disability insurance, worker protections, unions, the VA, etc. But there'll also be longer-term impacts caused by the deregulation of industries like insurance, online colleges, and credit cards that will be given free reign to feast on their customers.

"He's a fascist. Of course he believes germs are real, and probably most of his followers also believe germs are real, that's not really the point. The point is to message to his white supremacist base that he will enact a white supremacist agenda, in spite of accepted science, in spite of provable facts, in spite of what reality actually reflects. 

More importantly, it's a grooming tactic towards his white republican base and towards moderates, it's a statement that you can be a part of the ""in group"" too as long as you learn to selectively ignore reality, to trick them into ignoring the obvious facts in favor of emotionally gratifying solutions, ultimately furthering the path of the average joe into extremism. 

The average person, even in red states or wherever, 15-30 years ago would probably agree that racism is bad and slavery was bad. White supremacists and neo nazis still existed, but they were highly taboo and not entertained in the same way, everyone knows racism is deeply wrong and there is no innate scientific difference between a black person and a white person. Neo nazis can't get anywhere with this prevailing attitude. But then start introducing modern conservative rhetoric, start massaging them to ignore that basic science, start getting them to fear those groups of dark skinned teenagers, start getting them to believe that immigrants are stealing their prosperity even if it makes zero logical sense, and then finally when they're primed and buttered up, offer them the only solution to their problem that makes emotional sense at this point: White supremacy. 

That's the point of ridiculous statements like the ""hatians eating pets"" or this guy not believing in germs. None of it is even meant to be serious or real. It doesn't matter even if you sit down with a conservative and a microscope and show them a germ and scientifically debate them.

2. **Binary thinking**: my ancestors may have survived, but that implies nothing about how often they got sick or permanently weakened by disease. There are levels of ill health between healthy and dead.

2. **Ignoring externalities**: my direct ancestors my have survived but spread disease killing others.

4. **Internal inconsistency**: you said handwashing was unnecessary because our modern lives are so clean, but now you suggest that it was unnecessary for my ancestors too? So it’s *not* because of modern life?

5. **Incorrect assumptions about historical context and modern health**: disease and death due to communicable disease was significantly more widespread prior to handwashing.

"Trump's entire next presidency will be nothing but trolling, he's not a man who wants to govern, just destroy because his very very fragile ego is wounded. He wants to win the presidency, carry out his revenge fantasy, and let the nation burn because he is a creature of pure id, vengeful and spiteful.

"It feels somewhat like a troll.  At least i hope it is.  But there are some other factors to consider.  I read/heard in the news this morning that Gaetz has already submitted his resignation from the House in preparation for this.  Couple that with the fact that the House Ethics committee was supposed to release their report on Gaetz borderline illegal activities  ( I say borderline as the FBI never charged him, but he definitely sounds guilty) this week.  Add to it that Trump is trying to get the new Senate majority leader to approve recess appointments so he can put whoever the hell he wants on his cabinet without Senate approval.   All of that together makes it sound like it might not be a troll.

We should be also careful thinking this is part of some nefarious, evil genious master plan on Trumps part.  Yes he is evil, but i dont believe he has the intelligence to pull off some kind of ""4D Chess"" maneuver.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

However....  he was never charged.  Never had a ""day in court"".  No trial.  No verdict.

And it is interesting how all of that happened while he was pushing very hard to get Trump to pardon Edward Snowden and Julian Assange.  Trump didn't because he listened to voices like Mike Pompeo who see Snowden and Assange as traitors and criminals......but the fact is that Snowden exposed the fact that the NSA is basically surveilling ALL of us ALL the time.

"From what I've read, you're correct.  I'm guessing you read an article similar to [this](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-department-of-government-efficiency-doge-elon-musk-ramaswamy).

With that being said, I have several questions -- many of which will simply be swept under the carpet under the excuse of ""Because Trump says so"".  They are:

1) Calling it a ""Department"" as a private entity isn't itself necessarily illegal, but I wonder what laws, if any, would apply due to its clear and intended proximity and reason for confusion with actual Federal departments.  They really can't just be hoping that, if they call it a ""Department"" enough, not only will the general electorate believe it but that Congress will [somehow just start to acknowledge it as a real thing?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW78swzn_Bs) Or, perhaps, [more like this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWRU8lf88g4)

2) Given the attention to detail of this ""department's"" leadership and the fact that they're claiming to have no payroll, are we sure if it's registered yet -- either as a NPO, pact, or business, etc?  Pro-tip: if not, beat them to it and then sue for infringement.  It's what Trump would do!

3) Given that this is presently a private organization, what level of security clearance will they be given?  Has this been clarified and, if so, at what level does that require non-Executive approval?

EDIT:. Do none of you know that Thomas Edison invented ""his"" light bulb in a research lab that was basicly just an R&D assembly line?

https://www.americanheritage.com/edison-and-his-team-create-light-bulb

>AT 9:00 a.m. on October 22, 1879, Charles Batchelor, a researcher in Thomas Edison’s “invention factory” in Menlo Park, New Jersey sat down to record the results of the previous day’s work. “We made some very interesting experiments on straight carbons made from cotton thread . . . ,” he began. The results were interesting, indeed. Earlier that month, after more than a year of frustrating efforts trying to make an incandescent light with platinum wire, Edison and his colleagues had struck out in a different direction, using filaments made of carbon, instead. That had proved to be the key decision in the invention of Edison’s light bulb.

In other words, Edison didn't invent the light bulb. He just put a bunch of people in assembly-line-like lab, had them try basically everything, and then he took the patent and the credit for the one thing that worked.

Edison was an investor, not an inventor.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"***From Justin Glawe for Rolling Stone:***

A “close friend” of Matt Gaetz, Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. attorney general, has asked a court to destroy records that could shed light on the details of a sex party with an underage girl that Gaetz allegedly attended.

The records include witness statements about a 2017 party that featured drugs, a 17-year-old sex trafficking victim, and, allegedly, Gaetz himself. Christopher Dorworth, who describes himself in a lawsuit as a “close friend” of Gaetz, has filed two motions requesting the records be withheld from release and “stricken from the judicial record,” court filings reviewed by Rolling Stone and American Doom show.

Well, if Kamala was running against any typical republicans I could sympathize with that sentiment, but the opposition was donald trump. 

If you care about muslims, palestine or the leftist values, how are you not already compelled to vote against Donald Trump? 

I don't understand how such a person would need to be convinced to vote for the NOT donald trump candidate. Like whatever Kamala's position is on any of those issues, it would almost certainly be much more sympathetic, and almost polar opposite of what Trump is going to do. How is Trump's stance better than the so called liz chaney centrists?

This is the guy who tried to enact a muslim ban. He is the guy that put kids in cages, separating them from their parents for months. His party and his scotus picks dismantled abortion rights. He almost explicitly supported white supremacist, fascism and so much more leading up to the election.

Nobody switched their vote from Joe Biden to Trump because of Palestine. Those people just stayed home. It wasn't even necessarily a protest abstinence. People who care A LOT about palestine still voted for Kamala for harm reduction. In fact, nobody in general switched from Biden to Trump, Trump got marginally less voters than last election, while the democrat turnout dropped off a cliff.

What actually happened, is that the portion of people who do support palestine, saw Kamala waffling on this shit to please Israel, they just tuned out and stopped caring about getting out of bed to vote for a Liz Cheney Republican with a D next to her name. Low turnout is not necessarily an active choice from voters, it's a result of having policy that generates little to no enthusiasm from her base.

No. Enact restrictions on corporate buyback or other non-productive market manipulation tactics? No. Medicare for all? No. Minimum wage increased? No. Insider trading? No. Reduce or halt military expenditure? No. Was he able to keep the chevron doctrine? No. Create any successful transportation initiative that resulted in any effective major projects?

What democrats refuse to do, is run on a platform of anything other than status quo and moderation. And the status quo \*fucking sucks\*.

"No there’s not a WW3 possibility. Least of all that pits China and US against each other. The worldwide economic collapse from that would quickly make the war unsustainable. It doesn’t even matter who’s in charge, that’s just market forces.

No what will probably happen is a continuation of US decline. The proxy wars the US engages in the Middle East combined with internal instability and inflation will eventually undermine the petro-dollar and lead to the collapse of American economic supremacy and the beginning of the end of the American empire. 

Markets are simply too intertwined for widespread war across economic giants. Granted the next admin is trying like hell to pass isolationist policies but that’s just going to lead to the instability and inflation that I referenced earlier.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

I believe we only have one woman serving currently in Marine reconnaissance of which and IIRC, they did not lower standards for this woman to participate. On average and not including outliers, women cannot maintain the operational tempo of men in infantry and this is why, buy in large they have not participated in infantry roles.

My personal opinion is that woman CAN serve in combat roles however I would advise against it, and anyone who knows the environment of a deployed element working in the field, men and women being mixed in those austere environments might not be a good idea. There’s also the issue of branches wanting to lower the standards for women to pass and participate in infantry roles, I do not agree that would be a good idea at all.

"My username is the way it is to remind me to not get involved. I also can’t read. 


I assume by the things you’ve written that you’ve done some time in low places. As have I. And I’d like to add some thoughts;

Current reports show that infantry is carrying somewhere around 117-119 pounds of gear on average. 

The USMC assault loadout is about 70 pounds of gear plus mos specific weapon system and ammunition. 

A large amount of injuries that female recruits suffer in bootcamp center around hip and knee injuries which can be directly attributed to movement under weight. 

The loadout we are currently carrying is not sustainable and has only gotten heavier over the years. The load bearing parts of the gear are designed with an average male body in mind, a body that moves differently and with a different set of maximum pressure certain joint systems can handle. 

The average female body has a completely different set of rules. Speaking from a purely physical standpoint, your average US female body type cannot sustain the current stressors required of an infantry Marine. With enough training and conditioning, some will be able to. The training is based on the average male body, the skeletal system itself is different between the sexes. 

One of two things needs to happen, either we understand that our current combat load and mission requirements are not amenable to all body types and we reconsider those mission requirements with new data on increasing lethality, or we just throw the baby out with the bath water and say “Ladies aren’t allowed to kill people and break things”",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Trump's plan is to increase inflation by at least 10% by placing tariffs on almost every imported good. All the people that voted for him because he promised to lower food and gas prices are in for a bad time when all their bills start going up once he enacts his massive tariff plan.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
"> Trump's plans likely won't lower their grocery bills 

Almost all the plans he's announced so far are set to increase prices. Tariffs increase prices. Deporting huge chunks of the workforce increases prices.

But the article misses the point. The far-right spent the last few months lying about how high prices were. They pretended eggs cost hundreds of dollars and steak was unaffordable. They can now just point to the prices staying the same and claim that as some wild success.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

They didn't even vote him out because of how much he bungled the pandemic response. They voted him out because covid happened during an election year and he was the incumbent.

No wonder he wanted the lockdowns to stop and hated Fauci for recommending them and the masks. They reminded people of the inconveniences of a global pandemic, and he would rather have had more people die if it meant the rest wouldn't have to change their day to day lives. Who knows, if the sycophants he's bring on now were with him then, the tactic of pretending the pandemic wasn't happening might have convinced enough people there was nothing he could have done and he would have been reelected.

"If you drink coffee, eat bananas, avocados, and other imported foods, you will by default pay 10% more.  These aren't just something we can magically start growing in the US.


As for domestic food, a lot of it is farmed by immigrants who are paid very low wages and for undocumented workers paid under the table, sub-minimum wages.  This keeps the price of domestically produced food low, but if those workers are deported, the wages will be forced to rise in order to bring on workers, or millions of acres will go unharvested as there is nobody to do that work.


Domestic feedstock will also rise, as its price is correlated to domestic agricultural production.  With the price of feed stock rising so too does the price of animal products.


Then there's the deregulating of the farming industry.  A key part of why prices are so high for beef and chicken was that farmers had to cull large portions of their cattle and chicken populations because of infectious diseases.  With less regulatory burden, these companies will simply keep doing the same things that have led to their populations being stricken by pandemic flus and bacterial infections.

In a poll study some time ago, someone asked a random group of food conscious people if they would consume hydroxybenzoic acids (gallic acid, protocatechuic acid), hydroxycinnamic acids (chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid), flavanols (catechin and epicatechin) and their oligo- (procyanidins) and polymeric structures (proanthocyanidins), flavonols (quercetin, isoquercetin, rutin, kaempferol, astragalin), dihydrochalcones (phloridzin, phloretin-xyloglucoside), or anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-galactoside) and the response was a resounding no.

"There is a funny irony in seeing Walmart-shopping Trump voters claim that RFK is going to make our food healthy.  They buy ultra-processed junk because it's either all they can/will pay for or they are hooked on the more addictive nature of junk food.  Their food is killing them due to their own choices.  The number of manosphere, ""I eat a caveman diet of expensive meats"" Trump voters is very small by comparison.

That said, I am a massive proponent of us increasing our food regulations.  We really do allow food companies to get away with horrific cost-cutting measures that are bad for us.  But, once again, the irony is that the GOP are why our regulations were gutted and the door opened to worse food.  Trump is aligned with the GOP so they aren't going to want to go along with more regulations that hurt food companies bottom line, which means RFK faces roadblocks from his own side.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

1. Only about 2 million fewer voters showed up to vote in 2024 than they did in 2020. This number seems like a wash when you consider that in 2020 in the middle of a pandemic, people had more time to vote, and Mail/early voting was easier or more expansive.

"As a chemist, it is most entertaining to me when people in my immediate family go on and on how synthetic ""chemicals"" are so horrible and organic is so good. First off, everything is a chemical and second, a synthetic chemical has the exact same impact and molecular structure as an ""organic"" chemical. There is literally no difference in how these chemicals react, behave, taste, in regards to whether they are synthetically made or not. This whole it's organic so it's always automatically good thing has to stop. 


In a nutshell, marketing wings of food corporations play upon the ignorance of the general people of synthetic vs organic and often use the word ""chemicals"" in a negative way, which is what everything actually is, and turns it into a big scary word. 


""Oh no that food has way too many chemicals in it, I can't eat that!""

"It's not out of touch to cite an objective stat re: aggregate experiences and be positive when they are good.  Economic indicators can never work on an ""individual American at a time"" basis so one person struggling doesn't disprove the broader stat.  If things are good for most Americans, we should be honest about that fact in same way people shouldn't be dishonest about egg prices for partisan reasons.  We need a shared objective truth that we can all agree on in order to move forward on policy debates.  

But, I definitely agree that there is a real need to address the outliers on the bottom side.  We shouldn't be leaving them behind just because ""most Americans"" are doing very well.  So maybe just change the language to say ""the economy is doing great based on the main indicators but we still need to help any American who is struggling""? But, when have Dems ever been less interested in helping those people than the GOP?  I can't think of any.  Trump promises big, but his actual policies never focused on helping them.  Dems are certainly centrist, status-quo politicians on average and aren't willing to rock the boat, but they've still generally been more focused on helping the working class (likely with the assumption it will also benefit businesses and big donors to keep things stable).

The reality is that those people at the bottom were likely hurt most by 3 things: gutting of social safety nets, deregulation, and neoliberal economic policy in general.

Another is actually just a flat-out racist who despises black people and would literally never vote for a black man, let alone a black woman. 

They try to say it’s the economy and inflation, but the first issue they always discuss is the “pet” point. And two of those relatives literally live off disability and social security.

"How can you have read that pdf and still come away with “lacks details”? She laid out what she wanted to do fairly clearly.

She mentions that it would be similar to the existing laws in 37 states, just pushing them up to the federal level. With a ban in place then departments like the FTC or DOJ could go after large corporations who price gouge. That is far more than just “tell manufacturers to stop gouging”.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"The problem was, in my opinion of course, is Trump came with actual plans. I know Reddit loved its “concepts of plans” stuff but he had bullets in the chamber idea-wise. Encourage and foster competition among food mfgs to lower prices. Tariffs to boost domestic production and consumption. Drill more in the US to lower energy prices and reduce foreign oil dependency.

Understand I’m not saying that’s how this will pan out. But when you’re looking into a camera and into the homes of millions of American families who see their budgets getting tighter despite making more, those concrete ideas are going to spark more voting motivation than “we’re going to tackle prices. Trust me bro”, *especially* from the party that’s been in office for 4 years. Stating the economy (as this macroeconomic monolith) is doing well also doesn’t play well family to family.

"""Trump came with actual plans""

\-- ""Encourage and foster competition among food mfgs to lower prices"" 

How exactly? That's literally the exact same as Kamala saying ""we are gonna stop them from gouging"".

\-- ""Tariffs to boost domestic production and consumption""

Well that will raise prices, so which is it?

\-- ""Drill more in the US to lower energy prices and reduce foreign oil dependency.""

In 2019, the US became a net exporter and net producer of energy for the first time in over 60 years.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"> Trump came with actual plans. 

Things actually hilarious

> Encourage and foster competition among food mfgs to lower prices. 

No. It will lead to lay offs. Experts have said so. Large conglomerates are not willing to take a hit in their profits by changing anything. They will just lay more people off, or wait for big tax breaks so they can buy back some stock

> Tariffs to boost domestic production and consumption. 

Do you have any idea how much fruit veggies nuts meats we import? Including ~85% of seafood we consume? It’s impossible for the US to grow or raise certain products, so with tariffs, either they will no longer become available, or more likely, normal Americans will be priced out of such things because the increased price due to tariffs. 

As for manufacturing - it’s a fantasy to believe that companies are going to give up the cheap labor of 3rd world countries. Most companies who currently manufacture overseas will never ever bring their manufacturing here because they’d go bankrupt. 

> Drill more in the US to lower energy prices and reduce foreign oil dependency.

Much like the manufacturing situation, the U.S. imports oil from several countries because it’s more profitable for U.S. refiners to process discounted, heavier grades of crude oil. These refineries have already invested in the additional complexity required to refine them. 

It is far cheaper for oil companies to pay cheap foreign laborers less money to pull the oil out of the ground, and cheaper to have it shipped here rather than do the entire process from start to finish here in the USA. Again, it’s just built into the process now. 

I can see how these Republican policy ideas look attractive, but if you look even slightly under the lid, it’s just not possible.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"What are you talking about? ""Encourage and foster competition among food mfgs to lower prices"" is more of a vague concept than Harris's plans. There aren't any specific mechanisms described in that sentence. 

How, precisely, does the government ""encourage and foster competition"" when, first of all, one of the tenets of the Republican party is not to interfere in private business, and second of all, there are really very few major food manufacturers to compete with each other. One of our problems is that we have mega-corporations that own most of the brands that you see at the store. Just because there are many brand names on the shelf doesn't mean that each of those brand names is a different company. The mega-corporations just don't have that many competitors to compete with, and they charge whatever ""the market will bear"", meaning that they can and will charge whatever they want as long as people are still buying their products, which they are because, as difficult as it is to afford food, we can't actually stop eating.

""Tariffs to boost domestic production and consumption"" doesn't work, either. Tariffs raise prices because all the costs are passed on to consumers. We produce a lot of our food domestically already, but we can't produce everything ourselves all the time because different foods have different growing seasons in different geographical areas. If you only eat very local foods, you won't find many of them at certain times of the year, and you won't find some of them at all. Haven't you ever read the labels on some of the produce you buy at the store? Where do you think bananas come from?

None of these vague concepts is really a plan, it's just the kind of thing you hear average people casually remark that they wish someone would do, but average people don't really know the mechanisms of government themselves or have any detailed, functional plans in mind. It's just stuff people say when they haven't really thought things through.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"> Tariffs to boost domestic production

What's the percentage of tariffs that will make the climate in the US viable for coffee?  Or bananas?  How about pineapples?  Will a 20% tariff make cashews and Brazil nuts grow in the US, or do we need a 40% tariff to magically alter the climate zones?  

Also, when the mass deportations start, the US agricultural industry will be crippled as it hinges on migrant workers to harvest crops.  Domestic supply will be unable to meet demand, which will drive domestic prices up.  Probably even more than the tariffs will increase imported produce.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"> Donald Trump’s transition team scrambled Thursday after Trump’s incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles was presented with an allegation that former Fox & Friends cohost Pete Hegseth, Trump’s nominee to be Defense Secretary, had engaged in sexual misconduct. According to two sources, Wiles was briefed Wednesday night about an allegation that Hegseth had acted inappropriately with a woman. One of the sources said the alleged incident took place in Monterey, California in 2017.

> According to the transition source, the allegation is serious enough that Wiles and Trump’s lawyers spoke to Hegseth about it on Thursday. A source with knowledge of the meeting said that Hegseth said the allegation stemmed from a consensual encounter and characterized the episode as he-said, she-said.

> On Thursday evening, Hegseth’s lawyer Timothy Parlatore said: “This allegation was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it.”

> [...]

> Ahead of the Thursday meeting, one high-level MAGA member familiar with the allegation said Hegseth wasn’t properly scrutinized before Trump made the controversial pick. “He wasn’t vetted,” the source said. But the senior transition source disputed this. “Hegseth was vetted, but this alleged incident didn’t come up.”

> [...]

> One Hegseth ally blamed the surfacing of the sexual misconduct allegation on GOP establishment members who are trying to thwart Hegseth’s nomination. “They’ll try to kill all these nominations before the confirmation vote,” the ally said.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

RFK Jr, a few months ago:

>I will show how President Trump betrayed the hopes of his most sincere followers. \[...\] He let Big Pharma and his corrupt bureaucrats run roughshod over him as President. He promised to cut the deficit and ran up the biggest debt in history. He promised to run the government like a business and then closed down our businesses. He promised to drain the swamp and then filled his administration with swamp creatures. He promised to protect our rights and then torpedoed the Constitution.

>[RFK Jr. said Trump ‘barely human’ and ‘probably a sociopath’ in recent texts](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4811282-robert-kennedy-jr-trump/)

"[AMONG the numerous advantages promised by a wellconstructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail, therefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. The instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made by the American constitutions on the popular models, both ancient and modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected. Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority. However anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will be found, indeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses under which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of our governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes; and, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one end of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations.
By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp)",2024_11_15,15_38_23

“**Limit which disabilities qualify veterans for benefits.** The authors of Project 2025 think that too many veterans qualify for disability benefits.

Disability benefits are often critical lifelines for veterans who became disabled as a result of their military service - and can be the difference between a veteran being able to put food on the table or not

Project 2025 proposes to have the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs cut costs by having fewer health conditions qualify veterans for disability benefits - a proposal could greatly restrict disabled veterans’ access to life-sustaining benefits.

From Mandate for Leadership p. 649-650” 

Fulcrum - [Project 2025: The Department of Veterans Affairs](https://thefulcrum.us/governance-legislation/project-2025-veterans)

“Both the Democratic and Republican parties also generally demonstrate strong support for veterans and their benefits. However, both parties still debate specific policy implementation and budget allocation. The Republican Party has expressed a preference for moving to a public-private partnership to administer many veterans benefits, while (most of) the Democratic Party favors investing in public infrastructure to meet VA mandates.”

“For the quarter ending March 2024, 80.4 percent of veterans expressed trust in the VA, with 91.8 percent specifically trusting VA health services.”

“However, multiple systematic reviews comparing VA and non-VA health care outcomes show that the VHA generally provides equal or better quality care, particularly regarding mortality rates and in safety, equity, and specific surgical and clinical outcomes.”

“A recent audit by the VA Office of Inspector General concurred and highlighted concerns that increased spending on community care could erode the VA’s direct care system and limit choice for veterans who prefer VA services. It warned that diverting funds from the VA to private care could reduce the quality of direct VA care.”

Defeat Project 2025 - [Veterans](https://web.archive.org/web/20240709101712/https://defeatproject2025.org/issues/veterans/)

“Project 2025 proposes that the VA reduce expenses by cutting benefits while funneling a larger fraction of its current budget into the pockets of private contractors. It proposes a personnel policy of replacing the leadership and decision makers with political appointees, while outsourcing core functions and silencing dissent from existing staff. It mixes policies from the current VA strategic plan with a dangerous vein of reduced benefits, corporate plundering, and politicization.” 

Raw Story - [Project 2025 will rob veterans and active duty troops of billions in benefits](https://www.rawstory.com/project-2025-veterans/)

“Among other recommendations, the plan proposes eliminating concurrent eligibility for both service-related disability benefits and military retirement benefits, which Tucker says would reduce mandatory outlays by at least $160 billion through 2032, and revising the disability rating awards that determine eligibility for benefits and determine monthly disability compensation to reap ‘significant cost savings.’

The plan also proposes to end enrollment in VA medical care for veterans in two low-priority groups to save an estimated $69 billion through 2032 and narrow eligibility for veterans disability by excluding disabilities that cannot be related to military service, which would save an estimated $37.6 billion during that same period.”

Government Executive - [Project 2025: The worst-case scenario for veterans](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/07/project-2025-worst-case-scenario-veterans/397874/)

“Veterans make up roughly 30% of the federal workforce, with approximately 300,000 veterans currently employed by the federal government.”

“Many of these veterans, including a substantial number who are disabled, find employment in agencies that Project 2025 targets for elimination, such as the FBI and the Justice Department.”

“By suggesting a 50% reduction in federal employees within a year and 75% within four years, Project 2025 is essentially advocating for a skeletal government, unable to perform its fundamental functions.”

“By dismantling key agencies and slashing federal jobs, Project 2025 risks undermining not only government efficiency but also the livelihoods of tens of thousands of veterans. These actions will have far-reaching consequences, weakening the very fabric of our nation’s administrative capabilities, betraying our veterans, and damaging the economy to prove a twisted point. We must ask ourselves what is more important: the livelihoods of our veterans and the health of our economy, or the whims of the few who want to dismantle the government.”",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Cutting off your nose to spite your face.

As for protests... Trump had multiple large nationwide protests during pretty much all his first term, Me Too and Black Lives Matter being the most famous but there were also countless other protests against fascism and authoritarianism happening basically everywhere (which is how Antifa became a boogeyman to the right).

The issue isn't getting people to care, it's getting them to care about problems before they become catastrophes. There's also the fact that large swathes of the electorate have the memory of a goldfish and/or don't engage in politics because they don't feel represented by either of the two major parties and third parties are functionally a pipe dream for solving that issue.

That stuff will be happening again but it'd be nice if these people would remember to show up at the ballot box to fix and/or prevent this crap from taking hold in the first place.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
Thanks! I’ve updated my comment with the Archive.org link; much appreciated.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
"I think mostly because the Me Too and Black Lives Matters protests are heterogeneous movements, whereas in Europe raising the retirement age is homogeneous in that it affects all. In the USA people have become tribes and are just worried about their group and/or celebrate the harm caused to other groups.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Eh, the Antifa movement was pretty homogenous as it was a general ongoing protest against authoritarianism and one that generally aligned with and supported the others that I mentioned while promoting left priorities like universal healthcare, voting rights, immigration reform, labor rights... 

The problem is that the supposed left wing party in the US, at best, played lip service to these things and failed to meaningfully incorporate those priorities in their platform. Worse still, Biden and later Harris moved to the right on several of these issues in an ill-guided attempt to woo away so-called conscientous Republicans away from Trump leaving many on the left feeling like they weren't wanted in the party that, on paper, is supposed to represent them.

As for why Biden+Harris did that... money. Not outright bribes per se but, thanks to certain SCOTUS rulings about money in politics, it's basically mandatory to have things like pacs/super pacs to support a national level candidacy. That money largely comes from lobbyists, corporations, and the wealthy, all groups that benefit from the status quo that left wing political discourse believes that it is necessary to disrupt.

They made a bet that these policies would peel away more Republicans from Trump than they'd lose from their own base and they lost that bet hard. You'd think they'd learn after Hillary, and Kerry before her, made the same gambit and lost their presidential runs for the same reasons.

Ironically, the same forces that prevent the Dems from going ""too far left"" may help contain Trump to some degree, basically, he'll be able to do whatever he wants as long as it doesn't affect the bottom line of our oligarchs.

Problem with that system is that the status quo is unsustainable, infinite financial growth in a finite world is a pipe dream. Everyone always hears about how well the economy is doing but the average person feels like they're just keeping their head above the water, too much of our supposedly amazing economy that both parties dote over only benefits the rich. And that is why our politics are so unstable, a lot of people have decided that if the left isn't going to save us from the system then they'd be just fine with having Trump tear it all down.

Things like race, gender, and sexual orientation tend to get more air time from our representatives because they both motivate people to vote but ultimately don't affect the bottom line of the wealth class (of which every politician, CEO, and person on the TV is part of) whereas the class issues almost never get talked about even though 90% of the population feels the resulting problems in their daily lives and that is by design. 

In a nutshell, the reason why in American politics it always looks like disparate groups are engaged in multiple zero sum struggles with each other is because our ruling class/wealthy elites are actively manipulating the animousity of these groups to prevent them from uniting against the elites in a full on class struggle. Better they fight each other than us is the thinking behind this plan.

Anyway, sorry for the trip to Narnia (honestly, even this is a gross oversimplification) but sometimes I feel like there's a lot of context to American politics that people from the outside looking in don't have.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

SSRIs have plenty of side effects, and how practitioners prescribe them can be problematic if they are more focused on prescribing as many patients as possible.

Let me preface this by saying that I think he is abhorrent, and this is me grasping at straws a bit.

It’s \*possible\* that RFK will focus more on alternatives to commonly prescribed anti-depressants. It seems like he is in favor of more research into the clinical use of psychedelics including psilocybin and MDMA (under guidance of a therapist). This isn’t a bad idea, anyone with drug-resistant depression has probably read up on the promise of psychedelics.

So it \*might\* be that he’s not going to impose a sweeping ban, but rather build up alternatives instead. I hope this is the case.

"This is wrong. From ChatGPT:

Yes, studies have shown that tooth decay tends to increase when fluoride is removed from drinking water. Fluoride helps to remineralize tooth enamel and makes it more resistant to acid from bacteria in the mouth, which can lead to cavities.

Research from several cities and countries has observed that when fluoride was removed from public water supplies, the rate of dental caries (tooth decay) increased significantly. For example, a study in Calgary, Canada, found a rise in cavities among children after the city stopped fluoridating its water. Other studies in areas with historically fluoridated water supplies have shown similar results.

While fluoride in toothpaste and other dental products helps, water fluoridation provides a consistent and widespread benefit across all age groups, especially in communities where dental care may be less accessible.

Yes, removing fluoride from drinking water can disproportionately affect people in lower-income communities. Fluoridated water is a cost-effective public health measure that provides protection against tooth decay across an entire community, regardless of individual income or access to dental care.

People in lower-income communities often face barriers to regular dental care and may have limited access to fluoride from other sources, like fluoride toothpaste, dental treatments, or regular checkups. This can lead to higher rates of untreated cavities, which in turn may lead to more severe health issues, such as infections or difficulty eating and speaking.

In short, water fluoridation is an accessible, low-cost way to support dental health across socioeconomic groups, and removing it tends to widen health disparities.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Example; know who doesn’t support the Special Diabetes Program that gives funding to diabetes research? Insulin manufacturers. It’s an $8b industry in the US…
Know what else they do? They buy up the smaller companies working on a cure and slow walk the process. They do enough to appease shareholders, but the process is intentionally drawn out because therapeutics can be much more lucrative (until generics start to compete). So anyway… they’re not sitting on cures… they use the system to stay on top and do whatever creates the most profits.   And EU has a much better process for all of this because there’s less influence from Pharma… faster and cheaper access.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"I knew as soon as she popped up at the UFO/UAP hearing this would happen… this is a serious subject that’s worth investigation. Regardless if they’re actually aliens or not. But her presence delegitimizes everything in the eyes of people who aren’t actually following the topic. 

AOC, Chuck Schumer, the late-Harry Reid and many more people on both sides of the aisle in Congress are taking this seriously and they know a lot more than we do. These hearings do not keep happening because of birds or balloons being misidentified by our military.

To her point though, these things have been observed around water for a long time. They seem to retreat to the oceans and emerge from the oceans. Alien or human it’s not crazy to surmise that there’s likely they originate from a carrier in the oceans. 

It should be noted literally everyone in the UFO community was mortified when she popped up and started saying the earth is flat and Joe Biden stole the election.

This is actually not a MAGA thing. This whole topic is the most bipartisan subject we’ve seen in decades. Chuck Schumer has introduced legislation on the topic of UAP/UFOs and NHI (aliens). AOC was involved in the last hearing and still takes this seriously. For nearly two decades Harry Reid was trying to get Congress briefed in on the subject because they were being lied to.

"There was an interesting interview with Steven Bartlett and the guy who ran the Pentagon's UAP program (Diary of a CEO).

As per him, the videos captured by fighter pilots and cross-referenced with other radars, etc., are just the tip of the iceberg. There's much more classified material, often with much better image quality.

Though, I didn't check this guys' credibility, nor am I versed enough in this topic to make a judgement.

For all that matters to me, I will consider these things military programs. Perhaps even of the US. After all, governments like to compartmentalize to keep things secret, so it's not unheard of, that the head of the UAP program wouldn't know what everyone else is up to.

This aligns with some members of congress not being keen to escalate these matters to the higher ups - besides the social stigma that comes with ""I saw UFOs"".

"Yeah I mean skepticism is absolutely warranted. Not saying anyone should blindly assume the answer. I think having an open mind that “this may be alien tech” is perfectly fine so long as we’re also willing to accept if it turns out to be human tech. 

I think so much of the outright dismissal of the possibility of aliens comes from hubris. The assumption that we know everything already and there’s nothing else we could be missing. Inner dimensional beings, extra dimensional beings, time travelers, aliens more advanced than us who understand physics in a way we still can’t conceive of, a breakaway civilization from our own planet whose been observing us for thousands of years. All of these need to be considered as possibilities within the “Alien” umbrella, no matter how unlikely. 

But we also must consider that there’s been absolutely massive scientific discoveries made nearly a century ago that have been hidden for whatever reason. Discoveries that would radically change civilization but due to the dangers we pose to ourselves have been hidden. For example these UAP seemingly can travel around the globe in earths atmosphere in a couple minutes. Easily breaking the sound barrier and not creating a sonic boom. If humans did develop that tech it’s also reasonable that the danger of it being weaponized was too great to reveal. If someone could use that tech to deliver a nuclear payload there would be no defense if you hit anywhere on the globe in seconds. 

The way I see it. Either aliens/NHI are here, our government seemingly wants us to believe aliens are here, we have an epidemic of our military personnel thinking they’re seeing UFOs, or a massive technological discovery has been hidden for 80 years at least and could have averted climate change all this time. Of those four options any one of them is one of the biggest controversies in human history. Every one of them is a massive, life changing reveal for humanity. It’s just frustrating when people just hand wave it away without looking into it or even considering it. Not accusing you of that at all, btw. Some comments in this thread are disappointing because of how quickly they dismiss something that has too much evidence to be outright dismissing it as simply an absurd conspiracy theory.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"I'm at a point right now in this saga where I'm rooting for all of my fears and guttural instincts to be vindicated. I have been watching this insanity unfold in the US for 8 years and I've been proven right about Trump every step of the way. If elected, he would ultimately destroy America. First up was Covid and the havoc it wreaked on America was not by chance. He lied, obfuscated and completely abdicated his duties as president, before, during and after the virus spread. As a result, Americans died at the highest rate in a century. That was the first shoe to drop and the first major event that vindicated my fears for the fate of this country under a Trump presidency. .

Then the unthinkable happened. American's reelected this sick and deranged animal to a 2nd term. They chose the man that botched Covid over the party that actually engineered our recovery from it. By all metrics we had the strongest economic recovery in the world from Covid 19. I'm not going to sit here and hash out Democrat vs. Republican either because you have to be an insane person to think that's an appropriate conversation when option B is Donald F'ing Trump. Without hyperbole, American's from all generation's (Gen Z will save us? LMFAO), elected a Hitler clone pedaling the same fake populist message about the enemy within, but this time without the benefit of an actual depression to point to. What's your excuse America? It turns out we are just a shockingly ignorant, greedy, hateful and misinformed society. We had one chance as a country to choose the better path forward and we refused.  Instead we made the devastating decision to embrace a known felon, rapist, cheater, liar, abuser, turncoat, fascist, the list goes on and on and on...

So this is what we are now. It wasn't an aberration or a fluke. Donald Trump represents 21st century America and we're going wherever he decides to take us.  And as someone who was desperate for Americans to wake up before it was too late, only to see them make a conscious decision to reelect Donald and effectively make him a king , I am praying that the chaos and destruction that is on the horizon does not spare a single Trump supporter. I truly hope they get to experience firsthand the effect of the choice they made on 11/5. That's what I'll be rooting for moving forward. That you all get exactly what you voted for in some form or another over the next 4 years. You truly, truly deserve it.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Today that’s just not true. Voters will trust anyone who says what they think they already believe, and if that person isn’t a real expert they believe him even more.

"It’s because Kamala Harris was campaigning as if it’s the year 2000 and was using scripted political messaging. Trump was just aimlessly rambling and speaking off the cuff-her truth telling via polished scripted messaging vs his relentless lies via average guy chatting 

The reason Kamala Harris’s campaign would have worked 20 years ago is cause it was either broadcast live, or in the news papers. Today, all the last minute voters do one google search and see 35 different videos of Harris saying 6 or 7 different slogans, and then Trump saying she’s ’low iq’ blah blah, it fits the narrative. this is one of a few major reasons I can think of",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"It’s a lot of things but a major one is that Trump, despite being a billionaire doesn’t really present as one. People often joke that he’s the poor man’s idea of a rich man. There’s something that FEELS working class to him. He’s not refined, he doesn’t really think about what he’s going to say, he speaks off the cuff and so on and so on.

Kamala and the democrats as a whole think through what they say, they don’t want to over promise, they don’t want to offend. They seem calculated and cold. Very corporate. Logically they’re obviously better than Trump but for many voters the Democratic candidates feel too rehearsed and too safe. That makes them feel unrepeatable and for a lot of voters that makes trusting them more difficult. 

Most voters do not vote on policy or really care or know about the policy. They vote on the feelings the candidate gives them. Trump’s schtick and his personality is actually very authentically him. He doesn’t put on a mask really. Yes he lies, but that’s not a mask. I mean he doesn’t really mask his personality much at all. It’s one reason why something like Joe Rogan is so vital. He has an incredible reach for an audience and the long format gives listeners time to get to know the candidate as a person not a political talking point. 

Add in the fact that democrats (not really Kamala) kept telling voters that the economy was better than ever and their financial burdens weren’t real and it’s no wonder why they trusted Trump more. The issues of trust had less to do with Kamala herself and more to do with the Democratic Party feeling too buttoned up. Too perfect. Not responding well to criticisms or observations that don’t paint them as perfect (Economy, Biden’s mental decline etc.). The issue was much bigger than Kamala tbh, it was a complete rejection of the 2010s era of the Democratic Party and how they (and the voters) conducted ourselves. But all of those frustrations with Democrats were projected onto Kamala some fair and others not.

We can argue policy as much as we’d like. This isn’t about logic or facts or policy it’s about emotions and who feels more genuine and Democrats need to really reflect on why Trump feels more genuine in comparison. We’re a party of mostly college educated coastal elites. We talk down to voters and call them stupid for not voting like we do. We need to connect with voters on a human level and not worry about policy detail. Treat them like people and listen, promise you’ll make their lives better. That’s really all people want. They don’t care about the billions of dollars or the celebrity endorsements or what TV ad played. They just want to see an actual person who cares and manufactured TV ads and the current model doesn’t convey that.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

So I think a few things occurred with donald trump that made him...""interesting""...he positioned himself as an outsider even though he was the consummate insider. He connected with his audience by telling them what they wanted to hear even though he didn't believe it himself. He convinced them he cared, even though he doesn't, and he had no problem with outright lying to everyone...tell the biggest lie that is still probable and people will want to believe it.

He's part of the Russian mob, he uses the system to his advantage, and brags about it...I mean, part of the reason trump is getting away with a lot of stuff that would land anyone else in jail is because there exists a two tier justice system, and frankly, he's using that system to his advantage...remember when he told hillary clinton the system is rigged and said, ""I know because I'm using it""...and that itself exposes the truth of how fucked up our laws and government is...

"People want radical change, not incremental change. Unfortunately, Harris’s own campaign amplified his message.

Trump’s message was: “Things are terrible and I am going to do huge, tremendous things that will make your life better!!”
 
Harris’s message was: “Trump is a radical, who is going to do crazy things that no one else in charge would ever do. The changes he wants to make are really not normal. And they are a serious threat to the status quo.”

People heard both of those and decided to gamble on crazy, radical change. 

Harris should have treated him like a normal politician, emphasizing that he promised a lot in his first term and delivered basically nothing for the average voter. Amplifying his revolutionary message was a mistake.

He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans... This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.*

*He was incredibly lazy. He wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him.*

...

*He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens.* 

...

*In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish—he would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat ""prodigious amounts of cake""...*

...

*He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked).

But if you listen to Trump: No, humans don't cause it.

Russian Invasion of Ukraine? That's scary.  A nuclear power is openly invading their neighbors and given how their Georgian conflict went, it appears Russia will continue to march West further into Europe.

But if you listen to Trump: Russians are actually the good guys.  (Or at a different rally ""I'm the negotiator, Russia will only listen to me!"")

Trump instead offers manufactured issues with tangible and solvable solutions: ""Let's keep trans people out of the bathroom!"" ""Jews control things!""

"""Trump is bad"" is not gaslighting, dude. Trump is fucking terrible.

Harris was remarkably consistent, so perhaps you just weren't listening? Or were listening to right wing talking points, because they better aligned with your prejudices?

She had a huge economic plan, it was validated by economics professors who also evaluated Trumps 'LOL TARIFFS LOL' approach as...really not very good (and indeed, apocalyptically stupid).

The economy is (or...was) also recovering really well: the problem is that people don't grasp that ""the price of eggs"" is not actually a key economic metric, and they thus assume, based on...what, vibes (?) that the economy must be shit and they're being gaslit. THAT is a failure in critical thinking.

Trump told them ""immigrants"" were the problem, and that immigrants were both mooching off welfare AND taking their jobs, somehow. It cannot be both, and this is a failure in critical thinking.

He also claimed illegals were voting (and indeed being bussed in by democrats to do so), and got congress to vote on a measure to stop this, despite the fact that YOU CANNOT FUCKING VOTE IF YOU ARE NOT A CITIZEN. This should be painfully obvious to even the most cursory consideration, but no: again a failure in critical thinking.



The most egregious of all, though, is the abject failure to consider that the man who has gone bankrupt 6 times, who has a long history of failing to pay up, who leaves others to pay for his failures, who has sexual assault convictions *and* 37 felony counts for using campaign money to pay off a sex worker he fucked while his OWN WIFE WAS PREGNANT, who lied constantly throughout his first term, and who was under investigation for a lengthy, detailed and not-at-all spontaneous plan to overthrow the government, AND ALSO under investigation for stealing state secrets and probably selling them to foreign powers (at the cost of american lives) in exchange for fucking handouts, and who was facing some pretty fucking serious jail time if he didn't get elected...

You recognize that the Democrats actually want to help and are trying to help but are stopped by the Republicans through parliamentary rules. You also recognize that Republicans enact bad policy when they are in power. 

Somehow you make the logical leap that both sides are the same when recognizing that 1 party is overwhelmingly to blame for the bad things. You make the assumption that if Democrats actually wanted to do good things they could just abuse or ignore the rules like Republicans, therefore they must not actually want to do it.

"I see one two ways.  First and foremost as a test of their fealty.  Rick Scott would have called a recession and given Trump the picks free and clear.  John Thune looks more like he wants hearing and a standard confirmation process, which means an airing of all their laundry and senators needing to answer for their votes.  With that there's enough to keep Gabbard, RFK Jr., the axe thrower, and Gaetz out of the cabinet in official roles.  Feels weird saying thank God that John Thune won, but here we are.

The other way I see it as picks that are so crazy that they make anything that follows feel at least passable normal.  I mentioned it elsewhere, but it's a trick the Animaniacs writers used.  They went on air with jokes that standards and practices would have axed, but they had really egregious jokes in there too that made the slightly objectionable material look tame.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"I think humiliating everyone is the point. Or rather, alienating everyone. It’s outrageous and distracts from other things he’s doing, like putting Russian propagandists in charge of our national intelligence apparatus, for example. That’s part of it. 

It’s also easier for him and his, ahem, *management style*, because these people have already thoroughly capitulated and bent the knee to him, so he knows they will always show total loyalty and support. They know to stay in line or else, and that gives Trump a lot of leeway to blame whoever he wants and generally do as he pleases. 

Lastly, a lot of these people are extremely controversial already, even to the right, and are obviously going to be incompetent at their jobs, especially if they help Trump do some of the dumb things he plans to do. He knows his base will go along with it as long as he says he’s happy with these folks… but if at any point he wants to get rid of him, it won’t take much to get his base to change their minds to follow Trump’s when he suddenly starts attacking them.

When Trump needs to go looking for someone to blame or push over, either way, these people are all easy targets that will give him plenty of ammunition to defend himself with (by attacking other) whenever he feels the need to do so.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Gaetz told him he’d be trumps guy. And that’s all Trump cares about is having lap dogs. So he chose Gaetz.

"> Also, what happens to his senate seat since he just quit?

He's a congressman so that's less of an issue but still an issue for Republicans. Since he's a congressman from Florida, a State with a Republican governor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis) he will probably just put another Republican in his seat for now. The problem will come down the road whenever people in Florida get a chance to vote on who will permanently hold that seat. Incumbents typically have a higher chance of winning reelection, but if Trump continues to nominate existing Congress people he's going to tank the GOP's chances at holding the House in the midterms. Since people thrown into those seats won't have the same name recognition that an actual incumbent gets from having run for office multiple times.

Google says DeSantis has already announced plans for a special election to replace both the Congressman (Gaetz) and the Senator (Rubio): https://www.newsweek.com/ron-desantis-florida-special-election-update-matt-gaetz-attorney-general-1985747

But until then, he can pick their replacements. Who will be Republicans one can assume. They may be more hesitant to make radical changes though, lest they lose their first election. That's really the only silver lining to these proposed nominations. That we might get a chance to eventually flip these seats.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

""It is difficult to trace the roots of Gabbard’s delusions. After serving in Kuwait, her opposition to any action against Assad – even if it were only from the air – seemed to flow from a belief that the US should never risk any soldiers on democracy-promotion efforts. She did not grasp the obvious, namely that such a policy of cowardice only telegraphs weakness to leaders like Putin and Chinese Premier Xi, virtually inviting them to help destroy pro-democracy movements anywhere – from Venezuela and Sudan to Hong Kong and Myanmar. Notably, the biggest donor to Gabbard’s political action committee in 2021 was Putin apologist Sharon Tennison.""

Now Harris did like a 50/50 on ""better than the scumbag"" and ""here are some nice policies for you"". It didn't matter.

I think maybe what everyone wants is CHANGE. Many don't realize how good we have it right now, and of course many even now don't really have it all that great. There is hope in change. People seem to vote for hope.

Maybe if Harris had lied and said things like ""with the current administration I have been unable to break the war in Gaza for XYZ reasons, but once elected president I will assemble a team and we will have it done in 30 days"". Or ""we have put too many agents into the IRS. Nobody wants to worry about an audit.

I'm so very very tired of pandering to terrorists


You cannot unbrainwash a cult. Not while their fuhrer is still alive.  The best way to fight back is for decent society to make sure that the people who voted for this are directly affected by it.  Publicly shun and shame them.  Do not date or sleep with them.  Do not financially support them or their businesses.  If you are a baker, do not make cakes for them.  If you are a landlord, do not rent to them.  If you are a neighbor, do not socialize with them.   Etc etc


No politician can do this for you.  When laws fail us, we each need to step up and be the change we want to see.  So if you want a nazi-free America, start by banishing them from your own little corner of the world.  If you voted for this, you are no longer welcome in my community.

"The problem with non-peer reviewed science is that it’s full of grifters. It’s just people, making claims, connecting coincidences, and promising that they have the answers.

They don’t. I grew up in an anti-vaccine wellness family. In college, I met a lot of wonderful people who were studying lots of different sciences. They all were excellent people who wanted to make the world better. 

So the premise of not trusting peer-reviewed science is basically saying “There are hundreds of thousands of people who study science in college every year. Then they go into labs and research facilities, completely change their morality structure to hide secrets from the public, and then they all keep it a massive secret, despite thousands of people being in on it.”  That’s statistically impossible.

Third, because the only way the rural white working class is ever going to vote for the Democrats is if they become completely identical to the Republicans, and no amount of pro-working class policies is ever going to change that, since they vote for Trump because they like him, not because they care about his policies.

You may call the Democratic Party a party of college graduates, pro-business centrists, and suburban moderates, but that is exactly the kind of people who split their vote equally between Trump et Harris this election, and that is exactly the kind of people the Democrats must become better at wooing to their side to win in the long term.

 Democrats are a pro-welfare state which has validity as well. Society as a whole works better when there are welfare safety nets. Absolute minimalism is insufficient in larger societies. 

The idea of libertarianism being core of our political system fails to recognize the difficulty presented. There is no overarching system to establish norms.  Money is what you choose it to be. You can drive on whatever side of the road you want. Extremes like this might work fine in a sparse farm community but not Manhattan or Beijing.

The answer, as always, sits in between. 

A welfare state is necessary. But there needs to be a process to question the current validity of the current welfare practices. You do not arbitrarily commit 90% of your country's resources for 1% of the population.

"Eva Longoria has fled the US and is living in Spain and Mexico as she fears it will become a “dystopian country” under Donald Trump.

The Desperate Housewives actress said that the Covid-19 pandemic had “pushed it (America) over the edge” and a second Trump presidency would make it a “scary place”.

She is now splitting her time between Spain, where she is a citizen, and Mexico, where her husband José Bastón is from.

Longoria acknowledged that she was “privileged” to do so and felt “anxiety and sadness” for people left stuck in America.

The comments, made in an interview with Marie Claire, come amid an exodus of celebrities after [Mr Trump won a second term](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-showing-early-signs-of-winning-election/) in office earlier this month.

Barbra Streisand has said she [cannot live through a second Trump White House](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/08/left-wing-millionaires-fleeing-america-trump-victory/), America Ferrera is reportedly planning to buy a house in Italy and Cher has said she may leave **–** because Mr Trump gives her an ulcer.

In the interview for the cover of Marie Claire, Longoria, 49, explained why she has distanced herself from Hollywood.

She and Mr Bastón and their son Santiago, six, now live between Spain and Mexico: Longoria’s latest TV shows, Searching for Spain and Searching for Mexico for CNN were about both countries.

Longoria said that she spent her “whole adult life here” referring to California.

“But even before (the pandemic) it was changing,” she said.

“The vibe was different. And then Covid happened, and it pushed it over the edge. Whether it’s the homelessness or the taxes, not that I want to s—t on California – it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now.”

Longoria added: “I’m privileged. I get to escape and go somewhere. Most Americans aren’t so lucky. They’re going to be stuck in this dystopian country, and my anxiety and sadness is for them.”

Longoria has been described as a Democratic power broker and campaigned for [Kamala Harris](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/14/kamala-harris-silence-trans-issues-election-democrats/) during this year’s election.

When Mr Trump was first elected in 2016 she took to her bed and was depressed for the first time in her life, she said.

But this time she found herself asking if her vote really mattered.

She said: “I was so untethered to the core of what I believe because I truly believed in my soul that the best person wins. And then that happened, and I was like: ‘Oh, wait. The best person doesn’t win’.”

If Mr Trump keeps his promises during his second term, the US is “going to be a scary place,” Longoria said.

"In anticipation of his second term, President-elect Donald Trump has already revived the good ol’ “[flood the zone with shit](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/11/trump-vermin-speech-democracy-fascism-2024.html)” strategy, dropping daily announcements about the [bonkers](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/11/matt-gaetz-donald-trump-attorney-general-disaster.html) [Cabinet](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/11/trump-cabinet-tulsi-gabbard-hegseth-defense-military-intelligence.html) picks (e.g., Tulsi Gabbard, Matt Gaetz, Pete Hegseth) he wants on his team. It may be tough to single out any particular ones as the worst of the bunch, but allow me to suggest two contenders: tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have been tapped as co-chairs of a proposed new “[Department of Government Efficiency](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trump-says-elon-musk-will-lead-doge-a-new-department-of-government-efficiency/),” or DOGE for short. (Yes, as in Elon Musk’s [favorite](https://slate.com/technology/2023/05/pepe-coin-coinbase-crypto-memecoins-explained.html) meme cryptocurrency).



To be clear, though, it’s not exactly a full-fledged department, or a government agency at all. Per Trump’s press release, it amounts to a basic report of recommended job cuts. Specifically, DOGE “will provide advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management & Budget … making changes to the Federal Bureaucracy with an eye to efficiency.” This makes sense for Musk, who wanted to retain control of his myriad companies while simultaneously providing input on all the regulators that contract with and ensure legal compliance from SpaceX, Tesla, and Neuralink. And if Trump is to be believed, Musk and Ramaswamy will merely “pave the way” for Trump’s administration to implement the recommendations and “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.”



Slate writer Nitish Pahwa [breaks down](https://slate.com/technology/2024/11/elon-musk-doge-twitter-purge-government-vivek-ramaswamy.html) all the issues with “DOGE,” and what a Twitter-style purge to the government might actually look like.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"It's more like,

Having rich people and poor people creates a gradient. Like any gradient in physics, it wants to even out, absent any sort of blocking or insulating material and absent an outside force.

There is an outside force - the tendency of wealth to beget wealth is a little like how a battery creates a voltage across the terminals. It typically settles at some value at which the reaction stops. 

There is no such regulation for capitalism. Money gets money, exponentially, until you die. Then that money gets divided linearly and continues to grow exponentially again. It's the definition of an unstable system (not bound to within any value). 

The infrastructure in this model is, in part, what enables the growth, but also what maintains it. It's insulation. It's what stops people from getting mad, or resorting to crime, or acts of desperation. Back to the electrical example - it's like potting compound, it lets you make transformers with voltages higher than the dielectric breakdown of air. 

What is the level at which the breakdown of the wealth inequality gradient occurs? Nobody knows. But whatever it is, it is certainly much lower than without any insulation - insulation being things like food stamps, social services, emergency medical, etc.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

His strategy is basically to make really big moves. If it works out then great. If it fails then get everyone to work twice as hard to patch it back together. It's a losing strategy because ultimately your resources to bounce back are finite. If you sting several bad calls in a row together it's unrecoverable. Even if you are able to bounce back, all that work put into the bad call was waste. The opposite of efficiency. 

Putting more time and resources into getting it right the first time is more efficient than doing it twice. But he's off the opposite mindset.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

What if the two disagree on something, would one supersede the other or would it be a stale mate with nothing being done?

Political appointments of agency Directors like this are to put one  ideologically aligned person in leadership to set the agenda for the agency.

Even if we assume these two would agree on every action the agency would take, what would having two of them making the same decision that one of them would make accomplish?

I just googled it too ""are two leaders better than 1""; generally yes, although there are pros and cons to everything. Some of those cons you mentioned. Potential authority conflicts, dilution of accountability and communication challenges but pros are improved team morale, continuity of operations, shared workload, diverse perspectives and enhanced decision making.

"Yes, I'm aware of the irony. You are missing the point. Antisemitism has been redefined away from the persecution of the semitic peoples (And necessarily had to be redefined away from that as Palestinians, like the Jewish people, are semitic) to being centered around not supporting the State of Israel. By allowing and supporting this redefinition, Democrats have played right into the evangelicals hands, because ultimately, it means, who cares if they want every single Jewish person converted to Christianity or exterminated in their revenge fantasy (And that's ultimately the ""point"" of Israel in their eschatology. Everyone within it dies or converts. So they do ""care"" about the Jewish people there in that sense)? They support Israel.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Its also lead to weirdness like Chuck Schumer having ""become Palestinian"" (One of the funniest lines ever uttered in politics) in their eyes for not following their preconceived notion of what it means to be Jewish.

The reality of Israel of course is that some of its vociferous and erudite detractors are in fact, very Jewish. I even once supported Israel some decades ago until a black Jewish man just completely wiped the floor with me in debate class.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"EDITx3: One of the comments below points out that this is simply an old filing, and it was uploaded to the net a couple months ago. **This is NOT the congressional ethics report we've been hearing about.** 

My god... if this results in Gaetz losing his seat, losing his nomination with the Trump admin, *AND* facing legal trouble... it will have made today's barrage of awful news worth it.

EDIT: Here are the highlights

THE CRIME 

>**Joel Greenberg, a former Seminole County tax commissioner who pled guilty to
underage sex trafficking, was reported to have provided information to investigators, “including
information about encounters he and [Rep. Gaetz] had with women who were given cash or gifts
in exchange for sex.”**

THE COVERUP

>**Rep. Gaetz “reportedly asked then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows
for a preemptive pardon from Trump regarding the sex-trafficking investigation.”**



>In February 2023, the DOJ informed attorneys for Rep. Gaetz that the department
will not bring charges against him.

>**On February 22, 2023, CREW submitted a FOIA request to the FBI and DOJ
Criminal Division seeking “all records related to the now-closed investigation conducted by DOJ
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (‘FBI’) of Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) that are not covered
by grand jury secrecy pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
including but not limited to DOJ’s decision not to bring criminal charges against Rep. Gaetz.”**

>CREW’s FOIA request explained that the records sought “would help explain
why Rep. Gaetz—a prominent member of Congress—was not charged with any crime despite
public reporting suggesting an abundance of evidence that he likely violated sex-trafficking laws
and the conviction of his close associate on similar charges.” Id. The request also explained that
“The public has a vital interest in learning whether the decision not to prosecute Rep. Gaetz was
motivated, even in part, by considerations apart from the sufficiency of the evidence against
him.”

>On June 5, 2023, the Criminal Division acknowledged receipt of CREW’s FOIA
request No. CRM-301920897 and wrote that “[b]ecause your request presents ‘unusual
circumstances’ (See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii)), we are extending the time limit to respond
to your request an additional ten days as provided by the statute.” Exhibit 

>**By letter dated November 24, 2023, the FBI “categorically denied” CREW's
request No. 1585062-00 “pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C)” because CREW's
request “ha[s] not sufficiently demonstrated that the public’s interest in disclosure (relating to the
operations and activities of the government) outweigh the personal privacy interests of these
individual(s).” Exhibit C. The FBI acknowledged “the existence of FBI records” relevant to this request, but claimed those records are exempt because “processing these third party records
would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”**

>On February 21, 2024, CREW submitted a FOIA appeal to the FBI’s
determination, arguing that the FBI’s reliance on Exemptions 6 and 7(C) was improper, and that
the FBI was required under the FOIA to still disclose all non-exempt, segregable portions of the
records.

>**To date, CREW has not received a determination on its FOIA appeal of the FBI’s
determination.**

>**To date, CREW has not received a determination on its FOIA request to the
Criminal Division.**

"It's not their spine.

Republicans learned the lesson Donald Trumps taught them over the last 10 years: All politics is transactional.

And they recognize the reality that Trump no longer has any particular value to them.

They needed Trump to get his voters to show up for them. And they did.

And now for the first time ever in American history we have a President whose a lame duck before he ever takes office.

Trumps got nothing else to offer Republicans, and they've got no reason to do anything for him.

They are now going to vote/act in whatever manner they believe will individually help them gain power within the party with the goal of controlling the party heading into 2028.

Don't misunderstand, that likely means doing things Trump also wants 97% of the time, because it happens their personal interests align, it's thing all Republicans believe help them personally with voters.

">If he even wants Gaetz, he can try an acting position

The thing with ""actings"" is you can't just pick a rando. There are only certain people who can be named ""acting"", basically an agency employee, or someone confirmed by the senate for a different role.

So yes, putting Gaetz in is doing Trump a favor, he can't just name him ""acting AG"".


>And how can you say that they needed Trump’s voters but now no longer need them? 

Because of Trumps record. The years he hasnt been on the ballot the folks he endorses tend to do pretty badly, even if the Republican who beats them in a primary doesn't do as badly.

The one thing he's never been able to do is deliver voters to Republicans in general.

Even this year, Trump was on the ballot, and it's not clear how useful his voters were to Republicans.

In the 7 swing states Trump won, 5 of them also had a senate seat on the line. 4 of those were won by Democrats.

That's 100s of thousands of Trump for President voters that did fuck all for the Republicans in general.

And even the one swing state senate seat Republicans won was by just 25,000 votes.

The 4 seats the Republicans picked up were all in red states to start with.

Republicans are obviously happy to ride his coat tails to power, but since he can't deliver those same voters when he's not on the ballot, they no longer have need for him.

>You have to find four Senate Republicans for whom that’s true

Collins, Murkowski and newly elected Senator Curtis opposed Trump in 2024.  Mitch McConnell no longer seems like a huge fan either. 

Not to mention newly picked Senate Majority Leader Thune was not Trumps choice to lead the Senate.

It doesn't look like the senate has any qualms not blindly bowing to Trump.

>Senate Republicans will need something to bring in voters. 

And I suspect this is exactly why they don't mind pushing back on Trump slightly.

You're right, they do need something to bring in voters. And with Trump voters not being reliable Republican voters, that might mean playing to non Trump voters....

That's the decision each elected Republican now has to make whenever Trump asks them for something not in the Republican party writ larges interest.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"Gabbard is horrible, but at the same time I do think the US can survive some intel leak. It’s crippling, but survivable. I think hegseth and Gaetz are the most dangerous because they’re the exact kind of yes-men, and incompetent/inexperienced, in the exact positions of power that both (a) could enable an actual coup; (b) cripple American capacity for defense in a key turbulent moment in the world.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"I don’t disagree with any of your assessment, but I think it leads to an extremely thin needle that Republicans need to thread (basically hope Trump’s term is exactly like his first). They need the credit for putting the brakes on Trump, without Trump being such a disaster that being a Republican becomes a drag on them. I think your swing state examples show that a Trumpless environment helps the Democrats more. And any real or perceived economic downturn will hurt incumbents, which further bolsters Democrat chances. 

And how are they going to pump the brakes without going full Never Trumper. I mean, maybe they don’t vote for Gaetz, but they’re ALL terrible. Are they going to just not confirm any of Trump’s picks except Rubio? I think politicians’ general risk aversion and Republicans’ particular cowardice will win the day

Their only real hope is to rig the deck in their favor that ensures them elections, but that also somehow doesn’t let Trump and his MAGA minions dominate. But Trump’s not going to let anyone rig anything if he’s not the main beneficiary",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"But that’s their problem. Trump doesn’t help them, but being anti-Trump doesn’t help them either. Without Trump, Democrats have a better shot than they do.

"Actually, I suspect they'll confirm most of them but Gaetz and RFK...outside chance of Hegseth going down.

The rest honestly from a Republican pov are pretty average/what you'd expect.

But I think that's how they thread the needle.  As long as Trump stays within party concensus, give him all the credit. When he goes outside concensus block him.

Then spin handles the rest, if Trumps Presidency is a dumpster fire, blame it all on the things he deviated on, and hold up the times they stood up to him as why it wasn't their fault.

If [by Republican standards] it's successful, start to take credit, using the times they stood up to him as proof of how they actually helped keep things good by stopping the bad ideas.

And its not like they are picking ""risky targets"" . So far it's the least popular Republican in the government (Gaetz) and the guy who never got above 5% support in any poll ever (RFK).

So these are easy layups as far as avoiding risk or backlash from voters.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Israel would cripple Iran which would then cripple aid to Russia which would force Putin to reconsider his attack. Not just that, but we would then also solve our problem of Iran developing nuclear weapons indirectly.

Love the blurb saying Trump isn’t indebted to no one…he’s literally known to have debts across the country for rally bills,2024_11_15,15_38_23
“First Buddy” is the cringiest shit I’ve ever heard in my life.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
My guess is Trump hates him because Musk is the type of character who grabs a microphone and needs to share his opinion. The orange monkey doesn't like anyone stealing the stage.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
"“ nearly every meeting and meal with president-elect Trump.”

"Will anyone be surprised if Trump just gives Elmo the finger, going after all the EVs (including Tesla), and screwing SpaceX out of government contracts, only for Elmo to say “I was lied to. Climate, EVs, Democrats are the good guys.”?

Maybe he noticed Musk has big hands.

And I bet that it will, one day, piss Trump off mightily.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
Lmfao liberals have jumped the shark and turned into MAGA.  continuously posting stories from trash websites cause it fits their narrative,2024_11_15,15_38_23
LOL damn this administration is trolling the libs hard. I love it.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
"What they mean by that is he is utterly un-fucking-touchable now. He needed Elon's money and platform to win but now that he has he doesn't need jack shit from anyone. So he might grant Elon a favor or two while it's convenient for him but the second it's not, he'll tell him to get lost.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

What is accurate is Trump never pays those debts and screws people who help him over all the time",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"I know the media likes to chase shiny objects, but let’s not blame them for reporting things that normally wouldn’t be acceptable in any other administration. The fact that there is already a clash of personalities between the president elect (🤮) and one of his biggest campaign contributors and richest man on earth is a news story.

It’s responsible to report the facts so that the people who pay attention know what’s coming.

I blame Trump for shortening the news cycle and the uninformed voters who have Trumpnesia from his first 4 years.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
Unironically turning it into a social media soap opera is the easiest way to make Musk lose his mind so maybe it counts as some esoteric form of psychological terrorism if we spread it around enough.,2024_11_15,15_38_23

if he revokes his citizenship for lying on his application and deports him that’ll be hilarious tbh,2024_11_15,15_38_23
Exactly. What can Elon even do to Trump to influence his actions? Trump is going to run a government that spends Elon’s entire net worth every 18 days.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
And to think all this happened bc someone couldn’t handle hard feelings over having a trans daughter and then being spurred by Biden WH when they didn’t invite him to their EV summit.  No rage like narcissistic rage. Let’s see what the next tantrum gets us.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Russia seems to think he owes them and reminded Trump recently in public. Yes, he is indebted to plenty of people even with his new power.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

Just don’t send him to Canada please. SA will love him though,2024_11_15,15_38_23
Yep. He can just use the government to enrich himself now like he did last time he was POTUS. Loyalty is always completely one-sided with someone like Trump. And when he does finally get tired of Elon what's he going to do about it? Ask for a refund?,2024_11_15,15_38_23

- Made a generous philanthropic contribution to his own Firm by serving as one of its clients when he got pulled over for a DUI while driving his father’s BMW home from a nightclub.

"Fox news and their online bot farms tell them that trump is the smartest, most mature and competent, best educated, and most qualified president ever. I’m sure they say the same about all of his assignments and none of their followers ever bother to look into it any further.

I literally had a coworker tell me that trump was the most qualified presidential candidate in history, while kamala was the least qualified in history…. 

Like, to them “failed businessman”, “reality tv celebrity”, “child beauty pageant organizer”, “felon”, and “friendships with noted traitors, sex traffickers and pedos” are the most important qualities in a president, while things like “honesty” and “education and experience in politics” dont even make it onto their radar…",2024_11_15,15_38_23

They’ve since altered the bid so that conventional bibles will be considered, but man is this guy messing with the church/state separation. I feel like he’s trying to get SCOTUS involved so they can set a new precedent.

Bibles and praying for Trump in school are both anti-American imo. That‘s not what my country is supposed to be about, there is no national religion.

edited to add: those Trump bibles were going to be purchased with taxpayer money. I inadvertently left that out and it’s relevant. Instances like these are not just limited to Oklahoma, though [https://19thnews.org/2024/10/ohio-oklahoma-spending-church-state-religion-schools/](https://19thnews.org/2024/10/ohio-oklahoma-spending-church-state-religion-schools/)",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"This is only the beginning, members of the MAGA coalition behind Trump have been pretty outspoken about implementing a Christian nationalist agenda

So, this is as good a time as any to shut down the revisionist BS that our country is a ""Christian nation"" founded on principles of Christian nationalism.

Our nation was not founded on religious doctrine, but enlightenment era principles that turned away from the religious authority of the church, away from the divine right of kings, away from a national religion, and towards reason, rationality and democratic ideals.

The framers relied on those enlightenment principles to write our founding documents and fervently opposed the  merging of religion and government. They rejected the Church of England and repeatedly rebuked the idea of a national religion or church

There is substantial evidence and documentation that points to these facts.

For Christ's sake, and quite literally, even Jesus believed in the separation of church and state 

Mark 12:17, Jesus said to them, *""Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.""*

Our founding fathers also staunchly opposed any union between religion and government.

In fact, some of them were devout deists, believing that rationality and reason should govern our society, not religion.

Thomas Jefferson coined the phrase ""*a wall of separation between church and state""* in his letter to the Danbury Baptist association. 

Thomas Jefferson's metaphor became part of constitutional jurisprudence. Jefferson was quoted by Chief Justice Morrison in Reynolds v. United States in 1878 and his writings on the separation of church and state have been referenced in a series of important legal cases throughout our history.

Roger Williams, an early puritan minister, founder of the state of Rhode Island and the first Baptist Church in America, was the first public official to call for *""a wall or hedge of separation""* between *""the wilderness of the world""* and *""the garden of the church.""*

There you have it, an early American statesman and minister, and a profound authority on the matter, acknowledging the need for this separation. 

James Madison interpreted Martin Luther's ""doctrine of two kingdoms"", as a conception of the separation of church and state.

During a debate in the House of Representatives, Madison also contended *""Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.""*

In his writings years later he documented his support for the *""total separation of the church from the state.""*

*""Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States"",* Madison wrote, and he declared, *""practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution...""*

John Locke also promoted this idea. In his, ""A Letter Concerning Toleration,"" Locke argued that, *""ecclesiastical authority must be separated from the authority of the state, or 'the magistrate'""*

Even George Washington supported this separation.

George Washington, who wrote to a group of clergy who protested in 1789 against a lack of mention of Jesus Christ in the Constitution, stated *“You will permit me to observe that the path of true piety is so plain as to require but little political direction.”*

That same year, he wrote to the Baptists of Virginia, *“If I could conceive that the general [federal] government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure … no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution.""*

John F. Kennedy, in his Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association in 1960, stated, *""I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute""*

Furthermore, *""One Nation under God""* wasn't even added to the pledge of allegiance until the 1950s, when there was a moral panic and fundamentalist revival that unfairly persecuted anyone who was assumed to be gay, communist, atheist, or anything but a god fearing, red, white, and blue bleeding Christian ""patriot"" for that matter.

The pledge of allegiance was first published in 1892 in an Issue of the *Youth's Companion*, an American Children's Magazine.

Francis Bellamy a Christian SOCIALIST, who *""championed 'the rights of working people and the equal distribution of economic resources, which he believed was inherent in the teachings of Jesus.""* worked for the magazine and drafted the ""Pledge of Allegiance"" as part of a marketing campaign to solicit subscriptions and sell U.S. flags to public schools.

The issue coincided with the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus reaching the Americas, a marketing gimmick.

 Bellamy *""believed in the absolute separation of church and state""* and purposefully did not include the phrase *""under God""* in his pledge.

What's more, Bellamy *""viewed his Pledge as an 'inoculation' that would protect immigrants and native-born but insufficiently patriotic Americans from the 'virus' of radicalism and subversion.""*

Additionally, *""In God we trust""* wasn't officially adopted and mandated for our currency until the mid-20th century, as part of an effort to distinguish the U.S. from the atheist communists of the Soviet Union.

The fact of the matter is, Christian nationalism has never been and never will be a foundational code for this country, its government or its laws. It was the biblical literalists in the south who vocally defended slavery and inflamed the sectional conflict. A time when our nation was divided more than it's ever been.

It *is* self evident, that in the United States of America, religion has no place in government, and vice versa.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"This is a fantastic post. It perfectly sums up what makes the US special. It’s special because it was founded specifically as the opposite to the norm at the time of tyrannical Kings and their supposed divine right, by God to rule and oppress the people. The US constitution was a concrete example of the Age of Enlightenment thinking. Discussion of Christian Nation is as un-American as King and Queens are. 

That the ideas of Liberty, Equality and Freedom run so deep in the US psyche is a testament to this. This is a product of the Enlightenment era. 

That US citizens would wish to put themselves back in the chains of oppression where church and state embrace says a lot about humanity and our inability to be free. We are like cached animals. We want to be out of our cage but are scared when we are. We want, or depressingly need the safety of its walls.

For me the key conclusion from the Enlightenment era was you are only truly free when you are free from all oppressors. This includes God. True freedom is breaking the last vestiges of self oppression where God is you oppressing yourself (and others).

For many, Freedom isn’t free it’s terrifying. They want to be oppressed with God as their oppressor.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

" A group of Oklahoma parents of public school students, teachers and ministers filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the state’s top education official from forcing schools to [incorporate the Bible](https://apnews.com/article/bible-mandate-oklahoma-schools-bixby-superintendent-19e235a16d9aefd350df9106a5d759b3) into lesson plans for students in grades 5 through 12.

">We're about to just homeschool our kids if shit like this goes through

You know that's the goal. Republicans want to get rid of the department of education. Betsy Devos did her best. 

Slash funding, remove materials, fire already underpaid teachers. People pull their kids out of the religious daycare. Some homeschool, others go to private schools. Public schools have less kids so they get less funding next round. That's what the school vouchers were intended for.

Next round more of the same since the funding was lowered until you completely get rid of public schooling. What's left is homes chool, private school and sunday school.

Maybe that works in an isolationist handmaid's tale world. But these kids cannot compete globally. US colleges get filled up by foreign students.

> In his latest book, published this summer ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Hegseth called on America’s next commander in chief to shift the military’s focus — beginning by reverting the Department of Defense to its pre-1947 name, the Department of War.


> Some of Hegseth’s writing also appears to echo the virulent rhetoric of white nationalists and Great Replacement theorists, taking particular aim at Islam. During Trump’s campaign to return to office, his team courted Muslim voters, many of whom were angry with the Biden administration over its handling of the war in Gaza.

> In his 2020 book “American Crusade,” Hegseth fulminates against Muslim birth rates and what he characterizes as the infiltration of American communities by refugees and migrants whom he accuses of leeching off government support. He writes that Islam “is not a religion of peace, and it never has been” and claims that “all modern Muslim countries are either formal or de facto no-go zones for practicing Christians and Jews.”

Gaetz is there to lead the brownshirts.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
"It's really quite hilarious how fast Trump shits the bed.

He is, historically speaking, a contender for worst president in US history just based on his first term's performance, and he's already making historically bad decisions... barely a week out from the election. It's so incredibly in character for him.

If they didn't NEED to feel the full weight of consequences of their bad decisions to *possibly, finally* learn a lesson, the Trumpy ""eggs and gas too expensive"" voter crowd would almost be pitiable. Pathetic? Yes... Pitiable, no, not quite yet.

We're in for some world-class incompetence and bungling yet again!",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Here's a bit of the top of the story:

Matt Gaetz’s selection for attorney general has veterans of the first Trump Justice Department reconsidering whether to reenlist.

Numerous former DOJ officials said they were initially excited or at least open to resuming their service in senior roles at department headquarters or as US attorneys, according to interviews with a dozen of those alums. But some said they began backtracking Wednesday afternoon as soon as Trump tapped the Florida House member and recent subject of a child sex trafficking investigation.

“This choice is putrid,” said a former senior Trump DOJ official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to talk candidly about peers’ reactions. “I can’t imagine anybody with integrity would want to work for this guy as attorney general. Period. Full stop.”

Even before the unexpected selection of Gaetz, a staunch Trump supporter who’s never worked at DOJ, the president-elect signaled he would prioritize loyalty over experience to head a department that had twice indicted him in recent years. That made it all the more important to have more mainstream choices for deputy attorney general and other top posts to ensure Trump’s agenda could be successfully implemented by people who know the building, several former DOJ lawyers said.

"Politically, it looks like gaetz’s selection is one of two options. 

One: it’s a bait-and-switch. Nominate the obviously unfit Gaetz, and then when he’s inevitably rejected by the confirmation process, pick someone who is also a horrible choice, but a little less so. I think several of his pending selection choices are this type of gambit. 

Two: I think this is more likely. Gaetz was picked to do some very, very nasty things. He is an established Trump loyalist, and a report was just about to come out likely to recommend his impeachment from the Senate. Under an unfavorable administration, it could also lead to actual arrest.  So… Trump will now own him, with loyalty and the threat of indictment as motivational tools. Gaetz will go after his political enemies, and no matter how far he crosses the line, he can never say no or risk actual indictment for the child sex trafficking he (allegedly) committed.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
Anybody who returns to the DOJ is going to be viewed by the world as something lesser than Matt Gaetz.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
"All I’m seeing are a bunch of narcissists with hyper inflated egos. Trump’s first term was rampant with infighting and this one will be even worse.

All of these picks are clearly tit for tats. How long will it be before his sycophants become impatient about wanting more? Will Vance pull the 25th sooner than THF/Thiel wants him to because he wants the presidency so bad? How long before Trump’s administration starts hating each other and sabotaging other people to get them kicked out?

Started election night. La Civita yelling at Corey Lewandowski, apparently vowing revenge.

Maga Republicans by and large seem wholly undisciplined. They turn on each other in a blink of an eye. Trump chafes at anyone getting more attention than him. Chafes at others being liked more than him.

My guess is the real discipline won’t start until Vance is president, but even there, he’s a puppet. How long before he chafes at his strings? Before he shrugs off their demands for quid pro quo and insists he’s there by his own merit and doesn’t need them?",2024_11_15,15_38_23

"The thing is, government NEEDS rank and file to make things happen - even bad things. You can't enact an agenda of terrible actions without personnel to do it. If the mid-level appointees won't join, then it will be harder for Trump to be as effectively bad.

"Snippet:

>[MSNBC](https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/msnbc)’s Lawrence O’Donnell on Tuesday suggested Elon Musk had suffered “a humiliating demotion” at the hands of [Donald Trump](https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump) after the president-elect handed the billionaire a non-official governmental role.

>Musk backed Trump’s winning campaign to the tune [of around $200 million](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/elon-musk-america-pac-donald-trump-campaign).

>But “the theory that Elon Musk might become, in effect, a co-president or the real president, while Donald Trump in effect retires to a life of golfing, suffered a significant setback tonight when Donald Trump announced that he would give Elon Musk a job that does not exist and will last, at most, 18 months,” said O’Donnell.

>

>*""The “funniest part of the Trump press release announcing Elon Musk’s appointment to a position that does not exist, in which he is being forced by Donald Trump to work with someone else who knows nothing about the subject he’s been assigned \[…\] is that they are both going to be the first people kicked out of the Trump government” as it states their work “will conclude no later than July 4, 2026,” said O’Donnell.""*",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Elon is Trump’s first real oligarch. He’s also his wallet now, a la Putin’s style of handling the Russian elite. If Trump wants something, Elon, whose wealth is tied to companies that are very, very dependent on government policy, is not in a position to say ‘no.’",2024_11_15,15_38_23
Elon Musk needs billions in tax dollars to keep his scams afloat and at any time if Trump is done with him he can just order the DOJ to start an investigation into the ridiculous amount of investor fraud he engaged in at Tesla.,2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Elon might not end up getting to act as shadow president as much as he seems to want, but it's still hard to see how this isn't a massive win for him.  He has J.D. Vance literally threatening to veto NATO agreements if the EU tries to regulate X (Twitter).",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Not only did Trump pay off Musk with a joke department, he doesn't even trust him to run it on his own.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Musk got the person he wanted to be President, anything more is a bonus. Even after a disaster of an election the media can't help but clickbait about Republicans facing theoretical consequences. I really hope people stop falling for it.",2024_11_15,15_38_23
"Is this even true? Elon is sitting in on calls to Ukraine, Israel, etc. Him not having an official government role doesn’t seem to matter, at least not right now. He’s still exerting a ton of influence.",2024_11_15,15_38_23

The media doesn’t know what Musk was expecting. This could be his idea for all they know. The media is literally saying Musk is upset because he didn’t get something that the media dreamed up. Fuck the media.,2024_11_15,15_38_23

By the Constitution, the budget is approved by the Congress, and so are the laws that set the obligations of the federal departments and agencies. If the new office is just an advisory board in the presidential administration with no direct power, all it can do is lobby congress to make cuts, like O'Donnell says.

"Sure.  Why does anyone think Musk isn't fully aware and fine with that.  Musk runs several companies.  He just wants to be in the room to tell those in power his thoughts.
